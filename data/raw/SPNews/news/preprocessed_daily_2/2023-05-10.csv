1,6f862de0-b8c3-3bcd-8cf0-5dc8f7ac0f41,SCHW,2023-05-10,Is Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-broad-market-102010857.html,1683714010,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) made its debut on 08/13/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Value category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab, and has been able to amass over $483.57 million, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Index.The Russell RAFI US Index measures the performance of the constituent companies by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.01%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 16.90% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.15% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB).FNDB's top 10 holdings account for about 18.66% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF return is roughly 2.58% so far this year and was up about 2.39% in the last one year (as of 05/10/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.13 and $56.94.FNDB has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 18.87% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1738 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF (DFAT) tracks ---------------------------------------- and the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&amp;P 900 Value Index. Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF has $7.45 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF has $13.13 billion. DFAT has an expense ratio of 0.28% and IUSV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new UCC5880-Q1 reinforced isolated gate driver offers features that enable EV powertrain engineers to increase power density and reduce system design complexity and cost while achieving their safety and performance goals. For more information, see TI.com/UCC5880-Q1.As EVs continue to grow in popularity, semiconductor innovations in traction inverter systems are helping overcome critical barriers to widespread adoption. Automakers can build safer, more efficient and more reliable silicon carbide (SiC)- and insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-based traction inverters by designing with UCC5880-Q1, featuring real-time variable gate-drive strength, Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), advanced SiC monitoring and protection, and diagnostics for functional safety.""Designers of high-voltage applications like traction inverters face a unique set of challenges to optimize system efficiency and reliability in a small space,"" said Wenjia Liu, product line manager for high-power drivers at TI. ""Not only does this new isolated gate driver help enable engineers to maximize driving range, but it also integrates safety features to reduce external components and design complexity. And it can be easily paired with other high-voltage power-conversion products such as our UCC14141-Q1 isolated bias supply module to improve power density and help engineers reach the highest levels of traction inverter performance.""Maximize EV driving range while reducing design complexity and costThe need for higher reliability and power performance for EVs is continuously growing, as efficiency gains have a direct impact on operating range improvement per charge. But achieving any increase in efficiency is difficult for designers, given that the majority of traction inverters already operate at 90% efficiency or higher.Story continuesBy varying the gate-drive strength in real time, in steps between 20 A and 5 A, designers can improve system efficiency with the UCC5880-Q1 gate driver as much as 2% by minimizing SiC switching power losses, resulting in up to 7 more miles of EV driving range per battery charge. For an EV user who charges their vehicle three times per week, that could mean more than 1,000 additional miles per year. To learn more, read the technical article, ""How to Maximize SiC Traction Inverter Efficiency with Real-Time Variable Gate Drive Strength.""In addition, the UCC5880-Q1's SPI programmability and integrated monitoring and protection features can reduce design complexity as well as external component costs. Engineers can further reduce components and quickly prototype a more efficient traction inverter system using the SiC EV Traction Inverter Reference Design.

Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and PVH Corp. PVH boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

Also, cost-reduction initiatives, a solid online show and strength in the GenNext program bode well.This led to impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Consolidated revenues grew 21.5% to $554.4 million, driven by gains from the BrandsMart buyout, somewhat offset by weak lease revenues and fees, and drab retail sales at the Aaron's Business.The company has continued to witness strength in its e-commerce platform. In first-quarter 2023, e-commerce lease revenues were up 12.3%, accounting for 17.9% of the total revenues. The uptick can be attributable to increased website traffic and a higher conversion rate. Some other notable efforts include increased investments in digital marketing, improved shopping experience, same-day and next-day delivery services, the personalization of products, and a broader assortment, including the latest product categories. Its express delivery program also bodes well.Aaron’s latest acquisition of appliance and electronics retailer, BrandsMart, is expected to strengthen AAN’s market position and help expand the customer base. The deal is also likely to generate significant cost synergies and aid Aaron’s top line. Notably, revenues were $144.2 million in the first quarter of 2023, driven by strength in small appliances and housewares, and e-commerce strength. The company has been optimistic about its performance in the near future. It announced the opening of its first BrandsMart store in 2023.A sturdy performance in GenNext stores bodes well. Notably, the company had 222 GenNext locations at the end of the first quarter. This accounted for more than 27% of lease and retail revenues, up from 15% in the first quarter of 2022.Hurdles to OvercomeHowever, Aaron's has been reeling under dismal margins, lower lease revenues and reduced lease portfolio size. This led adjusted EBITDA to decline 20.7% year over year to $45.9 million. Meanwhile, the EBITDA margin contracted 210 bps to 13.2%. Consequently, the bottom line declined 24.1% year over year from the 87 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter. On a GAAP basis, AAN reported earnings of 41 cents per share versus 68 cents in the year-ago quarter.The company continues to witness sluggishness in its Aaron’s Business segment. In first-quarter 2023, revenues declined 9.6% year over year to $412.1 million due to lower average lease portfolio size and lease renewal rate, coupled with fewer exercises of early purchase options and weak retail sales. Also, lower customer traffic led to delayed deliveries and lower lease revenues.For the Aaron’s Business, revenues are expected to be $1.50-$1.57 billion, down from the prior stated $1.53-$1.60. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $170-$185 million, down from the earlier mentioned $165-$180 million. For 2023, the company anticipates revenues of $2.15-$2.25 billion compared with the earlier guided $2.20-$2.30 billion. The lowered revenue outlook is mainly due to lower early purchased options and drab retail sales at the Aaron's Business in the said quarter and the remainder of the year.High inflation and other challenging economic conditions have been concerning. The company’s segments are expected to continue experiencing softness in customer demand in its core product categories, including appliances, furniture and electronics, in the first half of the year.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research As a result, AAN shares have lost 15.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%.Bottom LineAlthough lower lease revenues, drab Aaron’s Business segment and inflation remain headwinds, solid online show, gains from the BrandsMart buyout and strength in the GenNext program are likely to aid Aaron’s performance in the near future. A VGM Score of A raises optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Topping it, the company’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up 5.4% in the past seven days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, PVH Corp PVH and H&amp;R Block HRB.Crocs, which offers casual lifestyle footwear and accessories, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and PVH Corp. PVH boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

11,90874dc5-d647-33f9-928d-9756f8710a6c,TMO,2023-05-10,The 3 Most Promising Nanotechnology Stocks to Buy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-promising-nanotechnology-stocks-193741984.html,1683315461,STORY,"['ADI', 'AMAT', 'TMO']","[Nanotechnology refers to technologies based on materials between 1 and 100 nanometers in size, which is the microscopic level. Accordingly, the production of such materials from nanotechnology stocks represent impressive upside, for those bullish on certain key industries.The products various nanotechnology stocks are focused on vary. But these range from body armor to solar panels, surface protection materials and food. Solar panels are a clear growth focus in nanotechnology as sales thrive. But the applications are much greater.At a much smaller scale, the physical properties of nanoparticles become very different from their larger counterparts. That implies that scientists will surely develop new materials utilizing nanotechnology with future commercial potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, here are three nanotechnology stocks I’ve got on my radar right now.ADIAnalog Devices$184.07TMOThermo Fisher$547.80AMATApplied Materials$116.29Analog Devices (ADI)Analog Devices (ADI) sign outside of buildingSource: jejim / Shutterstock.comAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor stock and a company deeply involved with nanotechnology. The firm primarily produces integrated circuits, power management products, and other microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).The company is based in Wilmington, MA, in the Boston metropolitan area. That gives it access to world-class talent and a hub of other resources. The company was founded by MIT graduates, and Analog Devices is also a founding partner of MIT.nano. MIT.nano includes a 214,000-square-foot facility dedicated to studying nanoscience and nanotechnology. In short, Analog Devices is one of the most connected firms in nanotechnology.Analog Devices primarily serves the industrial B2B end market. However, it has also carved out a strong presence in the automotive and communication sectors.It’s also a very profitable company with a strong commitment to its shareholders. It returns 100% of free cash flow to shareholders, redistributing $12 billion in capital over the last five years. So, it’s safe to say that Analog Devices will remain deeply connected to nanotech far into the future.Story continuesThermo Fisher (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is a promising nanotechnology stock, not because it produces novel nanotech. It doesn’t. Instead, Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the companies integral to studying nanotech and understanding its applicability to business.The company sells complex analytical products and software that allows researchers to understand nanoparticles. Without its products and services, nanotechnology breakthroughs become less-likely.The company is a broad servicer to the scientific community, and its products and services extend far beyond nanotech. It produces all kinds of testing equipment for the physical sciences. The company has certainly benefited from the pandemic, and the resulting boom in testing supply demand.That resulted in lower profits in the first quarter, down by 9% year-over-year. However, the company is keen to reward its investors even as sales slow down in the post-pandemic hangover. As a result, the company repurchased $3 billion of stock, while increasing its dividend by 17%. That makes it a compelling purchase with a reasonable narrative, despite slowing sales.Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is another semiconductor stock. It provides chip manufacturing equipment, software, and services to firms across the sector. In addition, the firm has deep expertise in technologies for modifying the properties of materials, including multiple highly-technical fields named here.Applied Materials’ Maydan Technology Center is a billion-dollar investment in leading-edge semiconductors. Its Materials Engineering Technology Accelerator (META) is another hub where leading nanotech is engineered and commercialized.The company approved a large buyback in March and increased its dividend from 26 to 32 cents. Over time, the most recent buyback authorization provides $10 billion in share repurchases. This authorization follows a $4.7 billion share buyback program launched in fiscal Q1. Applied Materials is promising, not only in terms of its technological prowess in nanotech, but also because its target price implies a strong upside for current buyers. Thus, Applied Materials remains one of the few providers in its particular space as well.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The metric lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1%.The year-over-year decline included a 3.7% internal decrease in local currencies, 1.4% growth from acquisitions and a 1.5% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Henry Schein, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteSales of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 test kits in the first quarter were $201 million, compared with $488 million in the prior-year period. Excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, first-quarter internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.3% year over year.In the quarter under review, the company recorded sales of $2.26 billion in the North American market, down 6.2% year over year. Sales totaled $799 million in the international market, up 4% year over year.Segmental AnalysisHenry Schein derives revenues from three operating segments — Dental, Medical and Technology and Value-added Services.In the first quarter, the company recorded $1.9 billion in global Dental sales, up 3.8% year over year. The segment’s revenues included an internally generated sales increase of 4% in local currencies and 2.3% growth from acquisitions. The business registered a 2.5% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Global Medical revenues declined 17.2% year over year to $1 billion. The segment’s revenues included an internally generated sales decline of 17.1% in local currencies and a 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Revenues from global Technology and Value-added Services rose 6.8% to $191 million. The figure included 6.5% internal sales growth in local currencies, 1.5% growth from acquisitions and a 1.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Story continuesMargin TrendIn the reported quarter, the gross profit totaled $966 million, reflecting a 0.7% decrease year over year. However, the gross margin expanded 96 basis points (bps) to 31.6%.SG&amp;A expenses rose 5.1% to $717 million in the quarter under review.The adjusted operating profit in the first quarter was $249 million, reflecting a fall of 14.4% year over year. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin contracted 102 bps year over year to 8.1%.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $126 million, compared with $117 million at the end of 2022. The long-term debt of the company at the end of the first quarter was $1.02 billion compared with $1.04 billion at the end of 2022.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $27 million compared with $93 million in the year-ago period.In the first quarter of 2023, HSIC repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares of its common stock for $100 million. The company had approximately $415 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases by the end of the reported quarter.2023 GuidanceHenry Schein updated its guidance for 2023. The outlook considers the current continuing operations and completed acquisitions, including the recently closed Biotech Dental buyout.For 2023, the company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.18-$5.35 (from the previously-projected range of $5.25-$5.42), excluding the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. This implies growth of (4%) to (1%) compared with the earlier projected growth of (2%) to 1% from the 2022 reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is currently pegged at $5.32.For 2023, Henry Schein expects sales growth of nearly 1%-3% compared to the 2022 figure (unchanged from the previous guidance). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $12.84 billion.Our TakeHenry Schein ended the first quarter of 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, results reflected good earnings momentum in the company’s core businesses.HSIC’s Technology and Value-added Services business witnessed strong growth in North America, led by customers’ upgradation from the Easy Dental product to cloud-based solutions — Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend. Within the Dental segment, patient traffic remained stable, with robust sales of traditional dental equipment. The company is also progressing well in its BOLD +1 Strategic Plan, instilling investors’ optimism.Meanwhile, lower sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, acquisition-related expenses and foreign exchange headwinds continued to affect the top line. Mounting operating expenses resulting in the contraction of HSIC’s adjusted operating margin are worrisome.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksHenry Schein currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ.Edwards Lifesciences, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported a first-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of 62 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.

Yet, the increasing cost of production continues to hamper the company’s margin performance. Weak hospital spending trends and tough competition also pose threats. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Omnicell ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues, driven by strong execution, disciplined cost management and revenue timing. Reported revenues exceeded the high end of Omnicell’s previous revenue outlook in the band of $273-$283 million, which is highly appreciated. The year-over-year increase in Omnicell’s service revenues emphasizes its digital transformation strategy.The company’s adjusted EPS in the quarter surpassed the top end of the previous guidance in the band of 4-14 cents for the first quarter, led by a capable product and service mix, expense timing and solid execution. Omnicell, Inc. PriceOmnicell, Inc. PriceOmnicell, Inc. price | Omnicell, Inc. QuoteOmnicell remains well-positioned to meet pharmacy and hospital needs, backed by recent acquisitions and expansion of its advanced services solutions. Strong revenue contributions from the recent acquisitions of FDS Amplicare, ReCept and MarkeTouch Media are major tailwinds. The company’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service continues to witness increasing demand from health systems, which buoys optimism. The company’s long-term sole source agreements with more than 50% of the top 300 U.S. health systems will allow it to help customers mitigate ongoing labor challenges.In terms of its 2025 financial roadmap, Omnicell targets reaching 1.9 billion to 2 billion of revenues by 2025 at a 14% to 15% compounded total annual revenue growth rate from 2021 to 2025. Over the same period of time, it is also targeting an expansion of non-GAAP EBITDA margin from 21% in 2021 to 25% by 2025, representing margin expansion of approximately 400 basis points. The company is well-positioned to deliver on the 2025 total revenue growth targets, driven by factors like growing its tech services revenues, benefits from long-term sole source customer partnerships, multi-year co-development plans and increased average deal sizes.Story continuesOn the flip side, revenues in the first quarter were down 8.8% year over year. The decline was mainly due to lower point-of-care revenues as a result of ongoing health systems and capital budget constraints. We note that the economic environment, including its effect on Omnicell health system customers, has caused many health systems to implement capital budget freezes and additional budget approval processes, resulting in elongated sales cycles. At the same time, ongoing health system labor constraints continue to increase, resulting in a higher-than-typical number of customers requesting to temporarily defer point-of-care implementations.On a segmental basis, product revenues declined 17.8% year over year in the reported quarter. Meanwhile, rise in operating costs led to an operating loss in the quarter, placing significant pressure on the bottom line. The company has taken several measures to refine its cost structure, including a reduction in workforce and other expense containment efforts.Over the past year, Omnicell’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has declined 42.6% compared with the industry’s 33.3% plunge.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.28%.Let’s delve deeper.Q1 Upsides: Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter. The upside can be attributed to strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD successfully continued with its double-digit sales growth momentum for the last two years.Core Diagnostics Grow Strong: Excluding COVID-testing sales, organic sales growth was led by mid to high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the United States and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year. However, China is showing improved market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased nearly 8% globally in the first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbott successfully continued with the rollout of Alinity, the company’s innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across its platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testingStory continuesUpbeat Guidance: Abbott expects full-year adjusted earnings (excluding specified items of $1.25 per share) to be in the range of $4.30-$4.50. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36.Abbott projects 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, of at least high-single digits and COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies have been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Lower Sales: Abbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were affected by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. Within Diagnostics, as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decline in COVID testing sales compared with first quarter of 2022.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has been constant at $4.38.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting a 9.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Shares are falling after the company's full-year guidance for 2024. Revenue and earnings per share came in lower than Wall Street analysts had hoped. Under Armour calling its full year 2024 a year of building the brand where it expects revenue to remain flat to slightly up.Now, more on that brand building. New CEO Stephanie Linnartz noting on today's call, quote, ""we are not pulling in our fair share of market growth. I believe a casual factor here is the inconsistency of how Under Armour brand shows up across our regions with the most significant opportunity to improve in the United States and China."" I know we've talked about this before, how popular it seems like Under Armour used to be when you go back maybe a decade ago.And I'm curious to see-- they mentioned multiple athletes on the call, Steph Curry, who's had a very good playoffs right now. That's Under Armor star athlete. When you talk about building that brand, what are they able to do around a Steph Curry, Justin Jefferson, very popular receiver in the NFL? How do you make Under Armour cool again and more appealing in the US? Because it's not good when part of your earnings call is basically talking about how Under Armour isn't as cool as it could be in rebuilding that brand.- Yeah, which is always a bit surprising to me given the fact that they do have that partnership, the close ties with Steph Curry, that they haven't been able to capitalize on that more just given his sheer popularity. You talk about him being one of the most popular athletes that is still currently, certainly, in the NBA, but really across all professional sports. Why Under Armour hasn't been able to really profit more off of that has been a bit surprising.Story continuesBut they're exactly right-- they have been, certainly, at a disadvantage. They have not been able to compete or really keep up with so many of its competitors, namely Nike inventory. A massive issue here for this company. They have been forced to offer more discounts in order to just get some of their inventory off of the shelves. They need a clear catalyst.And right now, we have to point out the new CEO has only been in her job for a couple of months right now. But the turnaround picture, I think, is really what the Street is waiting for.- Yeah, that's a major question. If you take a look at Nike, it feels like they have so much momentum right now. We have the new Ben Affleck, Matt Damon movie coming out. People are just talking about that brand more than Under Armour. And talking about Steph Curry and these brands partnering with those personalities, we've seen that really work for a lot of these footwear companies-- Crocs, Post Malone. He made Crocs cool again. So it's trying to find that new face, perhaps, that could be at Under Armour. You would think Steph Curry would be it.- Well, I think the other thing, too, with Under Armour over the next couple of months is when you talk about a weakening consumer picture-- and Under Armour is already struggling to get sales-- Nike is probably going to be in a good position. People are going to keep buying Nikes. It's how do companies like Under Armour overcome what might be weakening consumer demand, I think, is an interesting story that's going to play out in retail next couple of months.- Yeah.]"

It expects gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, driven by supply chain tailwinds related to lower freight costs, partially offset by mix impacts related to higher off-price revenues and higher promotions expected in the company's DTC business.

The company's new CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, expressed optimism on the call. Take a listen.- I want this brand to win, to really win, by achieving the vision we all have for it. We are operating and executing with our eyes wide open. We know there is much work ahead of us and that we must move with urgency. Although fiscal '24 will be a year of building as we lay the groundwork aligned with our priorities, I am confident that we will achieve the growth and profitability that I know this brand is capable of over the long run.- Well, despite that earnings beat, Under Armour's stock down more than 4% after the company issued guidance below the analyst consensus as rising costs weighed on demand. Under Armour also said revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up slightly versus 2023. Under Armour's new CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, noted in a statement that she's prioritizing amplifying global brand heat, elevated design and products, as well as Under Armour's positioning in the US to drive growth.Well, joining us now to discuss is Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, David. So you were on that earnings call. Did you hear anything that really moved the needle on your price target of $15.50?DAVID SWARTZ: No, I don't think so. The outlook for next year, for fiscal year 2024, was quite disappointing. I was at $0.63 for the year, and Under Armour put out a forecast of $0.47 to $0.51, and that would be down from the last couple of years; earnings. So that was a bit of a disappointment. But the fourth quarter itself, the numbers were a little bit better than I expected. Revenue is slightly higher, and the EPS was a couple of cents higher.Story continuesSo I thought the fourth quarter was decent. It wasn't great. The gross margin was mediocre, but that's to be expected given the market conditions. But I don't see anything that really changes the long-term outlook for Under Armour or changes my fair-value estimate, which is $15.50, which is clearly considerably higher than the current stock price.- And so with that in mind, then, what is it going to take in terms of a growth story for Under Armour to get to that point?DAVID SWARTZ: I think we need to see more consistent top-line growth. And that's been the problem for Under Armour going back probably seven years now. And it's not likely to happen in the next fiscal year either. So as you mentioned, Under Armour just brought a new CEO, Stephanie Linnartz. This was her first appearance on an earnings call, the first time that analysts like me ever really heard from her at all.She laid out a vision on the call to improve, really, three major areas for Under Armour. That was product brand in North America. Under Armour has focused on those areas in the past, so that's nothing new, really. But maybe with a new CEO, there can be a renewed focus and some-- I think a better strategic direction.Because if you look at the last few years, Under Armour has really changed its direction multiple times. There has not been a consistent strategy, and that has really hurt the company. And the company has lost market share to other sportswear companies. So I think there needs to be more of a focus on, really, the areas of strength for Under Armor and, really, less of this never-ending change in direction.- And so to that point, then, how would you say perhaps Under Armour has any sort of competitive edge over, say, a Nike and Adidas?DAVID SWARTZ: The competitive edge that Under Armour has is that it's very much focused on professional athletes and hardcore athletes. They don't do a lot of athleisure stuff like leggings and casual sweatshirts and casual T-shirts. A lot of it is really focused on athletes who are wearing Under Armour while performing sports. The target market for Under Armour is athletes in the high school and college range, and that's an area where I think they do have credibility.I think they have an advantage there over some others, like Adidas, which is seen more of a lifestyle brand, and Nike, which is in everything. Nike is really broad-based. So I think that Under Armor's advantage is it's focus on real athletics. But there's been a lack of focus on that, too, in recent years because Under Armour has terminated a number of sponsorships of sports teams and colleges. And so you really wonder if they're sending the right message sometimes.- And I do want to ask you about something else that came up, which was the persistent inventory issues, which means some of these promotional pricing is going to have to continue for longer. Why do you think Under Armour hasn't worked those kinks out yet? Because a lot of other companies seem to have a better management of their inventory than Under Armour.DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah, the market has been difficult for a lot of companies, so I would give Under Armour a bit of a pass on that. A lot of companies did struggle to get their inventories under control last year, including Nike and Adidas. Adidas has been doing far worse than Under Armour recently, so it's been a very difficult market for a lot of companies in this industry. Under Armour, though, it just simply hasn't had the top-line growth. And so that's made it difficult for them to maintain to control the inventories.The inventories came in too high into the holiday season, then there were too high coming into calendar 2023. And that required a lot of discounting. But again, Under Armour was not the only one. And so we saw elevated inventories and discounting, really, across the industry.

This was an interesting one to track this morning. Shares of Under Armour sinking after demand took a hit from higher inflation, sending the retailer's annual sales forecast and profit outlook below expectations here. Shares are down by about 8%.And one thing stuck out to me-- and I would have loved to listen in on this earnings call, just to see the tone that was struck here. But one thing really stuck out, which was in the early comment that they provided, and saying, essentially, that this is going to be a year of rebuilding, essentially. And that is a theme that we've heard from some of the other tech companies, a year of efficiency.The only reason why I would say that this strikes me a little bit more in this, kind of, year of rebuilding and positioning for the brand here is because, you know, as we've just gotten through some of the NFL draft, for the sports fans out there, and Under Armour's got quite a few sports fans that they are trying to market into, when you hear a year of rebuilding, that strikes you as a, OK, things are going to be bad for a while, for a little bit here, as you're trying to turn the ship around.They mentioned in this call-- and they've got a new CEO that's at the helm-- that they need to prioritize the athlete more, and that, kind of, signals maybe where they got away from some of the performance element of the athlete and still were looking across where they could get into that, kind of, athleisure type of trend, that Lululemon, Nike, all of them, Adidas had invested heavily into. But for some of those other brands, they had continued to prioritize the performance side of that athletic landscape.And so, for Under Armour, getting back into that-- of course, a brand that has one of the greatest shooters of all time in the NBA, Steph Curry, under its brand for a huge contract-- it'd be interesting to see where they, kind of, leverage some of those insights from the athletes to build that on that next leg of growth.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: I mean, the bottom line here is they're not selling enough stuff.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: That's the bottom line. And they have too much inventory on hand. They're going to have to keep marking stuff down in order to clear that inventory. It's not a good position to be in. For whatever reason, whether it's the athletes, blah, blah, blah, that's the bottom line, and that's the crux of or one of their big problems, I would say.]"

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +20.00%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $0.15.While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.Here is how Under Armour performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Net revenues- North America: $862.18 million versus the five-analyst average estimate of $867.20 million.

The mean price target of $55.14 indicates a 26.9% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises 11 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $4.24. While the lowest estimate of $47 indicates an 8.2% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 38.1% to reach $60. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for MGM, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for MGMHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why MGM Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 270.5%, as four estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, MGM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much MGM could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is MGM Resorts International (MGM). MGM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Another notable valuation metric for MGM is its P/B ratio of 3.06. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 9.01. Over the past 12 months, MGM's P/B has been as high as 3.38 and as low as 1.17, with a median of 2.28.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. MGM has a P/S ratio of 1.12. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.42.Another great Gaming stock you could consider is PENN Entertainment, Inc. (PENN), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of PENN Entertainment, Inc. currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 16.98, and its PEG ratio is 0.93. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 52.67 and 2.51.Story continuesPENN's Forward P/E has been as high as 23.33 and as low as 13.70, with a median of 18.77. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 19.28, as low as 0.93, with a median of 1.41.PENN Entertainment, Inc. sports a P/B ratio of 1.11 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 9.01. In the past 52 weeks, PENN's P/B has been as high as 1.64, as low as 1.11, with a median of 1.35.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that MGM Resorts International and PENN Entertainment, Inc. are likely being undervalued right now.

It’s about as far away from A.I. chatbots as an investor can get. That said, transportation stocks remain integral to the U.S. economy, contributing more than 5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) annually, or about $1.3 trillion.Indeed, the movement of people and goods by land, air and water continues to be big business throughout the U.S. and all of North America. Without successful transportation networks and corridors, the U.S. economy literally couldn’t function. For this reason, investors should consider investing in transportation stocks.Not only are there many to choose from, but transportation stocks tend to be mature and established companies with a track record of delivering strong earnings growth and returns to shareholders.

The railway operator that serves all of Canada and the midwestern U.S. just reported record first-quarter revenue of CAD$4.31 billion (US$3.16 billion) due largely to strong grain shipments and elevated oil prices. The company’s Q1 revenue was a 16% improvement from a year earlier. Earnings per share also grew 38% in Q1 to CAD$1.82 from CAD$1.32 a year earlier, and beat the CAD$1.72 consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.Equally encouraging was the fact that Canadian National Railway raised its full-year 2023 guidance, forecasting earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits, up from a low single-digit target previously. The company also raised its quarterly dividend nearly 10% to CAD79 cents per share to be paid on June 30. The dividend yield now stands at right around 2%. CNI stock is flat over the past 12 months (up a slight 0.94%), offering a nice entry point to investors. Over five years, the company’s share price is up 52%.Story continuesGeneral Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of hot quarters, how about General Motors (NYSE:GM). The Detroit automaker announced first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines, and lifted its full-year 2023 guidance. Notably, GM reported earnings per share of $2.21 versus $1.73 that was expected on Wall Street, according to Refinitiv data. GM’s Q1 revenue totaled $39.99 billion versus $38.96 billion that was forecast by analysts who cover the company. Looking ahead, the company said it expects earnings of between $11 billion and $13 billion this year.The company’s Q1 results were praised by analysts and investors, who bid up GM stock 4% immediately following the latest earnings print. However, just before the Q1 financials were made public, General Motors announced plans to invest more than $3 billion in a new battery cell manufacturing plant in the U.S., with a target date to begin operations in 2026. That was the latest announcement made by the company concerning its electric vehicle strategy.In all, GM is putting $35 billion towards electrifying its vehicle fleet. GM stock is down 14% over the past year.Kirby (KEX)A photo of a large shipping vessel at sea.Source: Daniel Wright98 / Shutterstock.comWhile not a household name, Kirby Corp. (NYSE:KEX) is nevertheless an important transportation company. The Texas-based firm is the largest barge operator in the U.S., moving bulk liquid products along the Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico, as well as along the U.S. coasts. Kirby even operates in Alaska and Hawaii. Products transported by Kirby through its barges include important items such as petrochemicals, oil, refined petroleum, and agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers.The business requires specialization, which gives Kirby a moat around its business and a niche role when it comes to transportation in the U.S. Impressively, Kirby has been operating since 1969, Kirby continues to report impressive earnings, most recently announcing that its first-quarter results beat on both the top-and bottom-lines. While not as widely known or followed by investors, Kirby can be viewed as a dark horse among transportation stocks. In the past 12 months, KEX stock has risen 15%.Boeing (BA)It Will Be a Very Long Road to Recovery for BA StockSource: ShutterstockCommercial aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) continues to take knocks. The latest blow to the company came in mid-April when it announced that it would halt deliveries of some 737 MAX airplanes due to technical problems. Specifically, Boeing said that it has run into quality problems with the parts of the 737 MAX aircraft that are manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR). Boeing said the issue concerns aft fuselage fittings supplied by Spirit that date back to 2019.Boeing warned that the problem will impact a number of undelivered 737 MAX airplanes both in production and in storage and could result in lower deliveries worldwide this year. Accordingly, this was the latest setback for a company that has been operating under a microscope since its 737 MAX aircraft were grounded worldwide between March 2019 and December 2020, following two crashes of those aircraft. Despite the turmoil, BA stock has proved resilient and is up 36% over the last 12 months. Notably, Boeing remains part of a duopoly when it comes to commercial aircraft manufacturing, along with France’s Airbus SE (EPA:AIR).Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL)trucking stocks Aerial Top View of White Semi Truck with Cargo Trailer Parking with Other Trucks on Special Parking Lot.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comOld Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) is a major truck transportation company in the U.S., operating nearly 6,000 trucks nationwide. The company moves goods from shipping terminals on America’s coasts inland via the national highway system. It’s not a cutting-edge business, but it is essential to keep the economy moving. Additionally, Old Dominion provides household moving services to individuals across the U.S.ODFL stock has been a strong performer over the past year. Over the last 12 months, the company’s shares have sped through the ongoing market volatility and delivered a 13% gain to shareholders. Over the past five years, the company’s stock has increased an impressive 252%. Old Dominion, which has been in operation for nearly 90 years, also continues to deliver for shareholders in other ways, announcing in February this year that it is raising its quarterly dividend 33% to 40 cents a share.Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH)cruise stocks docked cruise ships. CCL stock.Source: Kokoulina / Shutterstock.comWe should include a cruise line here, and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) gets the nod. Indeed, the Miami-based cruise ship operator has come roaring out of the pandemic, recently reporting that its first-quarter revenue rose a whopping 249% to $1.82 billion from $521.9 million a year earlier when it was still dealing with Covid-19 restrictions on its operations. Citing improving travel demand, Norwegian also raised its full-year guidance, saying it expects a full-year 2023 profit of 75 cents per share compared with 70 cents previously.Norwegian Cruise Lines has the advantage of catering to affluent travelers, and has successfully raised the prices of its tickets over the last six months to offset the impacts of higher fuel and food costs, driven by inflation. The company announced that its occupancy rate during Q1 was 101.5%, up from 86.6% in the previous fourth quarter of 2022. While Norwegian reported a Q1 loss of 30 cents a share, it was better than the 41 cent per share loss expected among analysts.

This time it is the recently-merged railroad Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) that came together on April 14 of this year after regulators approved the $31 billion combination. This merger created the only railroad that connects the U.S., Canada and Mexico, creating a continental transportation company for North America. The company just reported its first earnings since the merger was finalized, and the results show that benefits are already being realized.Canadian Pacific Kansas City reported net income for this year’s first quarter of $800 million, which was up 36% from $590 million a year earlier. Earnings per share came in at 86 cents, up 37% from 63 cents a year ago, while revenue rose 23% from a year earlier to $2.27 billion. The newly created railroad company said the merger led its overall shipment volumes to rise 11% compared with the first quarter of 2021. Notably, CP stock has gained nearly 10% since the merger between Canadian Pacific Railway and Kansas City Southern was finalized in mid-April.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GM.

To provide BEV and HEV designers with a faster and more reliable high-voltage circuit protection solution, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces the E-Fuse Demonstrator Board, enabled by silicon carbide (SiC) technology, available in six variants for 400–800V battery systems and with a current rating up to 30 amps.The E-Fuse demonstrator can detect and interrupt fault currents in microseconds, 100–500 times faster than traditional mechanical approaches because of its high-voltage solid-state design. The fast response time substantially reduces peak short-circuit currents from tens of kilo-amps to hundreds of amps, which can prevent a fault event from resulting in a hard failure.“The E-Fuse demonstrator provides BEV/HEV OEM designers with a SiC-based technology solution to jumpstart their development process with a faster, more reliable method for protecting power electronics,” said Clayton Pillion, vice president of Microchip’s silicon carbide business unit. “The E-Fuse solid-state design also alleviates long-term reliability concerns about electromechanical devices because there is no degradation from mechanical shock, arcing or contact bounce.”With the E-Fuse demonstrator’s resettable feature, designers can easily package an E-Fuse in the vehicle without the burden of design-for-serviceability constraints. This reduces design complexities and enables flexible vehicle packaging to improve BEV/HEV power system distribution.OEMs can accelerate development of SiC-based auxiliary applications with the E-Fuse demonstrator because of the built in Local Interconnect Network (LIN) communication interface. The LIN interface enables the configuration of the over-current trip characteristics without the need to modify hardware components, and it also reports diagnostic status.Story continuesThe E-Fuse demonstrator leverages the unrivaled ruggedness and performance of Microchip’s SiC MOSFET technology and PIC® microcontrollers’ Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs) with a LIN-based interface. The companion components are automotive-qualified and yield a lower part count and higher reliability over a discrete design.Microchip’s SiC power solutions provide the industry’s broadest and most flexible portfolio of MOSFETs, diodes and gate drivers in bare die, discretes, modules and customizable power modules. For more information about Microchip’s SiC semiconductors, visit our website.Development ToolsThe E-Fuse Demonstrator Board is supported by MPLAB® X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to enable customers to quickly develop or debug software.

(Photo: FreightWaves and Gartner).ORLANDO, Fla. — Employment numbers in the supply chain post-pandemic are revealing a tremendous amount of turnover and lack of employee engagement, according to the keynote speaker at this year’s Gartner Supply Chain Symposium.Caroline Chumakov, a director and analyst at Gartner, spoke to a packed opening session Monday of a meeting with attendance soaring past 3,200 and asked the crowd: “Will we leave a supply chain that lights up careers, feeds global economics and sustains our planet?”It’s a task that will be challenged by the fact that, according to Chumakov, employee turnover in the supply chain is 33% more than it was pre-pandemic. “Only a quarter of our employees are highly engaged and only 16% of them are willing to go above and beyond in their jobs,” she said.“Our employees are checked out, challenged and choosing to ‘quiet quit,’ which is a problem because we kind of need their labor,” Chumakov added.Jose Reyes, a senior director and analyst at Gartner, gave his definition of quiet quitting in a separate presentation and did so by way of an example.“You notice that one of your employees that typically sits in front of the room at a meeting and is very interactive, asking questions is now sitting in the back of the room,” he said. “And you realize that’s been happening frequently, say for the last couple of months. They’re not engaged and they’re not asking questions.”Chumakov put it more bluntly. Productivity in the supply chain “is at its lowest point in decades,” she said.“The human story is one of progress,” Chumakov said. “And yet now our productivity is stalled.”That situation, she said, raises the question: “Have we really reached peak human productivity?” There is data to suggest that may be the case, but “there are gaps in the story that suggest otherwise.”The title of Reyes’ presentation asked the question: “Has the ‘quiet quit’ crept into your logistics team?”“So you might ask, ‘OK, this is interesting but why does that matter to me?’” Reyes said, citing a Gallup survey that concluded that disengaged workers were costing the economy $7.8 trillion in lost productivity worldwide. Logistics executives need to ask “how much of that $7.8 trillion is hitting my bottom line and two, how do I avoid having a similar impact or any impact in my organization?”Story continuesTo make sure quiet quitting isn’t hitting a company, Reyes said logistics executives first need to identify it. One thing to watch is if a manager stops coaching his employees. “So that in itself can lead to their direct reports quitting quietly,” he said. “They’re not getting any feedback and it’s not a good feeling to be in.”Reyes ran through numerous strategies to combat quiet quitting, but he ultimately said that Gartner research has found logistics employees have “two main expectations” out of their management.One is that employees “want to make sure there’s an environment where they’re encouraging discussion on open issues,” Reyes said. The second is similar: that there is “psychological safety and trust” in their teams.Gartner’s Jose ReyesChumakov delivered the message that a team succeeds if it “unlocks the collective potential of the supply chain.” That concept “is the recognition that the whole of your supply chain is greater than the sum of its parts.” What matters is putting those assets of individuals together in a community within the organization. Add in technology and the result is that these assets contribute more together than apart.Chumakov got the large audience’s attention when she asked anybody to stand up if “you have a skill that is not fully utilized in your current role,” a request that appeared to be greeted with 100% compliance.“Take a look around,” she said. “There are thousands of skills going untapped in this room alone. Imagine what would happen if we asked this question of your teams.”Supply chain companies are “in the midst of a labor shortage,” Chumakov said. “But we are leaving valuable skills on the table.”Chumakov, looking over the post-pandemic quit rate, had praise for the way supply chain companies reacted to the onset of the pandemic and that those days contained some lessons for the future.“We had to pivot and find creative solutions.” Decisions needed to be made quickly and often to “take on more risk,” she said. “To meet this challenge, there was no time.”Chumakov said that “the high risk of moving slowly forces us to do what was necessary to make decisions quickly.” The result? Teams moved across organizational lines and decisions were often taken by “those best suited to make them. We chose to make trade-offs in our decisions.”Coming back to the message of community, supply chain companies facing the pandemic “chose to work together, we chose to trust each other and we chose the pursuit of a common objective. That is the power of community,” she said.Those lessons need to continue even now that the pandemic is over. “We can mobilize people to action by building communities targeted at specific challenges and aligned on key objectives,” Chumakov said. The way supply chains responded to COVID showed that “we can solve problems within the structures we have today.”More articles by John KingstonTruck transportation jobs aren’t afraid of heights; they rose again in AprilRXO comes in relatively strong in quarter full of weak freight earningsUber Freight EBITDA continues to fall; revenue drops 23% from a year agoThe post ‘Quiet quit’ product of disengaged supply chain workforce appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Two of the sources estimated it could be up to 5 million barrels less than May.Saudi Aramco cut its official selling prices for all crude grades to Asia for June-loading cargoes amid lower refining margins. But the price reduction was less than the market expected.The falling profit margins have prompted refiners to seek cheaper oil from other suppliers such as Russia, or even consider lowering operational rates.China is stepping up procurement of discounted Russian oil, with more private mega refineries joining the cargo sweeping, and is taking bigger share of the medium sour Urals market which was dominated by Indian refiners.The overall full supply volumes come even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, known as OPEC+, announced output cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd) starting from May for the rest of the year.Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, will reduce production by 500,000 bpd under the cuts.(Reporting by Muyu Xu; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Christian Schmollinger)]"

Brent in late January hit its high of the year above $88 a barrel.""While central banks continue to overcorrect for their last policy mistake (high inflation), oil is rushing to anticipate disinflation and a US recession driven by bank failures and tighter lending conditions,"" he added.In addition, debt-ceiling tensions could worsen those macro headwinds, Blanch said, noting that the cost of insuring against a US debt default recently traded at their highest levels since 2009.President Joe Biden met with Congressional leaders on Tuesday to work on a deal to steer the country away from a potential debt default.The government could run out of money as soon as June 1, meaning a divided Congress must raise the country's $31 trillion debt limit in weeks or else drive the US into a catastrophic and unprecedented default on its debt that could trigger a recession.Oil demand is already being clipped by rapidly rising interest rates directed by the Federal Reserve and a reduced amount of credit extended to businesses and households. With that, BofA downwardly revised its global oil consumption growth expectations to 1.2 million barrels of oil a day this year and to 1 million barrels next year.Story continuesThe investment bank held onto its forecast of $90 for Brent in 2024 as it foresees OPEC and its allies potentially cutting production again to protect prices. OPEC in April said it would cut production by 1 million a day.""We believe OECD demand will eventually improve while OPEC+ will likely keep proactively and preemptively managing supply,"" said Blanch.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects oil demand to contract by 400,000 barrels a day this year and by 200,000 million barrels a day in 2024.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 60% in that time.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for News To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.News became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that News has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on News' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of News, it has a TSR of 65% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveNews shareholders are down 2.5% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 3.7%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for News   you should know about.Story continuesOf course News may not be the best stock to buy.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, InterDigital has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that IDCC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MSI has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.IDCC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.70, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.55. We also note that IDCC has a PEG ratio of 1.37. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.84.Another notable valuation metric for IDCC is its P/B ratio of 3.51. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MSI has a P/B of 191.90.Based on these metrics and many more, IDCC holds a Value grade of B, while MSI has a Value grade of C.Story continuesIDCC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MSI, so it seems like value investors will conclude that IDCC is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 8.29%, and its shares gained 17.83% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a market capitalization of $2.283 trillion.Baron Opportunity Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of mega-cap software and cloud vendor Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) performed well during the quarter despite mixed fiscal second quarter results. Microsoft’s largest consumer business, Windows licensed to computer vendors, decreased sharply year-over-year as last year’s results were bolstered by pandemic-related purchases. Its key commercial business, reported as Microsoft Cloud, grew 29% on a constant-currency basis, beating Wall Street expectations. Drilling down, its Azure cloud computing business also beat expectations, growing 38% on a constant-currency basis, but growth slowed in December, and management’s forward guidance was for further deceleration to a low 30% level. Since tougher macro trends emerged last year, cloud businesses, like Azure, have faced headwinds from enterprise customers optimizing their cloud workloads and spending, after a brisk pace of expansion over the last two years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed this during the last earnings call: “Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend…. This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers, helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long-term loyalty…. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today’s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty…while gaining efficiencies of cloud-native development…. I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher…on a secular basis…. [W]hat [customers] accelerated during the pandemic, they’re making sure they’re getting most value out of it or optimizing it.… [A]t some point the optimizations will end…[and] the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they’ll plow into new workloads and those workloads will start ramping up.” Our research continues to indicate that the long-term secular trend of cloud computing remains healthy and intact and will only be boosted by the AI inflection. Morgan Stanley recently issued a report titled “Cloud Optimization: Short Term Pain for Long Term Gains.” It echoed Nadella’s commentary and our own internal research, concluding that today’s cloud optimization would ultimately yield “higher cloud adoption, upsizing [the] opportunity by 30% longer term.” The key finding of this report, supported by a survey of 80 chief information officers across the U.S. and Europe, was optimization is increasing the expected penetration of the cloud longer term, with 57% of workloads expected to reside in the cloud post-optimization vs. 45% of workloads pre-optimization.Moreover, we believe Microsoft is positioned to be a prime beneficiary of AI because of its ownership of and partnership with OpenAI, the inventor of ChatGPT; its Azure AI supercomputing cloud infrastructure, which is the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI and a leading AI development platform for other enterprises; and Microsoft’s own AI innovations across Bing search (a chatbox virtual assistant), GitHub CoPilot software development (automated code suggestions and completion), and its Office suite of worker-productivity software (virtual assistants, branded CoPilot, to draft or summarize an email, enter data into a spreadsheet, prepare slides, etc.).

55,9e1cbd1e-10e1-36fb-8d61-f6bca9e983e9,MSFT,2023-05-10,Google expected to unveil its answer to Microsoft's AI search challenge,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-expected-unveil-answer-microsofts-102120942.html,1683714080,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[By Jeffrey Dastin and Greg BensingerMOUNTAIN VIEW, California (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google is rolling out more artificial intelligence for its core search product, hoping to create some of the same consumer excitement generated by Microsoft Corp's update to rival search engine Bing in recent months.At its annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California, on Wednesday, Google offered a new version of its namesake engine. Called the Search Generative Experience, the revamped Google can craft responses to open-ended queries while retaining its recognizable list of links to the Web.""We are reimagining all of our core products, including search,"" Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's CEO, said after he took the stage at the event.He said Google is integrating generative AI into search as well as products such as Gmail, which can create draft messages, and Google Photos, which can make changes to images like centering figures and coloring in empty space.Alphabet's shares rose 4% on Wednesday. They are up 26% so far this year, compared with the 8% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index in the same time frame.U.S. consumers will gain access to the Search Generative Experience in the coming weeks via a wait list, a trial phase during which Google will monitor the quality, speed and cost of search results, Vice President Cathy Edwards said in an interview.Google’s foray into what is known as generative AI comes after the startup OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, the darling chatbot of Silicon Valley that launched a furious funding race among would-be competitors. Generative AI can, using past data, create brand new content like fully formed text, images and software code.OpenAI, backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft and now integrated into Bing search, has become for many the default version of generative AI, helping users spin up term papers, contracts, travel itineraries, even entire novels.For years the top portal to the internet, Google has found its own perch in question since rivals began exploiting the technology. At stake is Google’s slice of the gigantic online advertising pie that the research firm MAGNA estimated at $286 billion this year.Story continues""AI can provide insight,"" Edwards said. ""But what fundamentally people want at the end of the day is to be connected to information from real people and organizations, knowing, for example, that this health information comes from the WHO,"" or the World Health Organization.Addressing how AI can spout incorrect information, Edwards said the company prioritized accuracy and citing trusted sources.Google will also mark up images it generates with AI and make it easier for people to vet a picture's authenticity.""Google's vision makes a strong case that search is evolving, not dissolving, and that Google is here to stay,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane.WHAT OUTFIT TO WEARWith the embedded AI, Google still looks and acts like its familiar empty search bar.But while a search for ""weather San Francisco"" will as usual point a user to an eight-day forecast, a query asking what outfit to wear in the California city prompts a lengthy response generated by AI, according to a demonstration for Reuters earlier this week.A challenge of drawing on such AI, known as large language models, is the high expense. Edwards said, ""We and others are working on a variety of different ways to bring down the cost over time.""Ads will remain key, Edwards said. ""We only get paid when there's a click.""BARD FOR 180 COUNTRIESMichael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, said, ""The company is showing a willingness and ability to reinvent and disrupt itself, which I feel will be favorably received by investors.""In recent years Google's rivals have taken its research breakthroughs and run with them in products, outpacing their inventor.ChatGPT came to light after an AI system Google revealed in 2017. The speed at which the chatbot grew - faster than any consumer application in history - encouraged the often deliberative Google to prod staff to hurry along projects.In February Google announced its competing chatbot called Bard. A promotional video that month that showed Bard answering a question incorrectly propelled a stock slide shaving $100 billion off Google's market value.Now, Bard will be multimodal like OpenAI's GPT-4, the company said on Wednesday, and it will make the chatbot accessible to people in more than 180 countries and territories.That means customers will be able to prompt Bard with images, not just text - for instance asking the chatbot to write a caption to a picture they hand it, it said.Behind Bard also is a more powerful AI model Google announced called PaLM 2, which it said could solve tougher problems. One of its PaLM 2 models is lightweight enough to work on smartphones, Pichai also said.In more news for I/O, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian told Reuters the division is lining up customers to put its newest technology to the test, among them Deutsche Bank AG and Uber Technologies Inc.As well, Google released a new foldable Pixel smartphone that lets consumers use the company's AI. To start the phone will be priced at $1799 and come with a free Pixel Watch. Google also unveiled a $499 phone it called the Pixel 7A, available for order starting Wednesday.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin and Greg Bensinger in Mountain View, California; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh, Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)]"

""We have got to be careful, where we make sure we are doing it the right way. But driving insights out of our analytics is a big opportunity for us to get better and drive more frequency.""Lynch acknowledged on an earnings call last week that Papa John's has been behind in tapping into its lucrative data to either upsell customers or get them to order more. Leveraging the new AI tools sweeping the tech industry could unlock the value inherent to Papa John's enormous dataset.In this Monday, Aug. 29, 2016 photo, a robot places a pizza into an oven at Zume Pizza in Mountain View, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)To begin course correcting, Lynch said he just hired former Chipotle marketer Mark Shambura as chief marketing officer.""[Loyalty members] have opted in to allow us to get the data so we can better meet their needs,"" he said. ""I think we have a big opportunity to do that. That's going to be a key differentiator for us from the rest of the restaurant industry.""Even without fully harnessing its data, Papa John's has had a strong run under Lynch — who joined the company in turmoil in August 2019 after the ousting of founder John Schnatter.Lynch has rebooted menu innovation, as seen recently in the release of a Doritos-flavored pizza sandwich. The company also benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic delivery boom.North American same-store sales rose 30% on a three-year average for the year ended 2022. By the same measure, international same-store sales increased 20%.Papa John's stock is up 83% since Lynch took over as CEO in 2019, outperforming the S&amp;P 500's 45% gain. Domino's Pizza shares (DPZ), meanwhile, have gained only 36%.But investors are going to want Lynch to reignite sales growth, and using technology is one way to do it.Story continuesFirst quarter same-store sales were unchanged year over year while international sales declined 6% as the pandemic eating boom continued to cool and the economy slowed.""Papa John's recent performance and tone on growth [was] more favorable than that of its largest delivery pizza peer [Domino's], which we think highlights certain differences/advantages that Papa John's is able to leverage in the current environment (third-party, product innovation, etc.),"" Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle wrote in a client note.Slagle added, however, that Papa John's is ""likely not immune [to the current environment], which could yield some downside vs. more optimistic expectations.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Customers are smart. Our guests come in, and they don't want to get nickel and dimed,"" Hochman said on Yahoo! Finance Live (video above).It's hard to argue diners at Chili's are getting ripped off on the Big Bacon BBQ burger. At a cost of $17.19, you get nearly 1,700 calories, consisting of two enormous patties, six slices of bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, red onion, pickles, and a side of fries.For a value-focused restaurant player such as Brinker, giving diners more bang for their buck worked out well in the first quarter.Same-restaurant sales at Chili's and Maggiano's rose a hearty 9.6% and 21.6%, respectively. The company said the sales gains were fueled by higher menu prices and more orders of premium items like that Big Bacon BBQ burger.Operating profit margins for Brinker rose to 13.4% from 13.1% a year ago.

73,4de91f25-cf1d-3018-b1d8-a0e09776e487,LUV,2023-05-10,FOCUS-US airlines thrown a curveball as consumer habits change post-pandemic,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-us-airlines-thrown-curveball-100000478.html,1683712800,STORY,"['DAL', 'LUV']","[By Rajesh Kumar SinghCHICAGO, May 10 (Reuters) - Shifting travel patterns by consumers in a post-pandemic world are forcing airlines to guess at what is the ""new normal"" as they seek to adjust by cutting flights, revamping networks and packing even more passengers into planes.Even as the thirst for travel remains strong, the changing trends are driving up airlines' operating costs and hurting revenue.They are also fueling worries about the strength of travel spending amid growing economic uncertainty, leading to a 6% drop in airline shares from their highs in January.""Today's flexible work conditions are helping to drive changes in ticket-purchasing patterns."" Citi analyst Stephen Trent said. ""Let's get used to it.""No-show rates have gone up as customers are changing their travel plans more frequently than before.Travel demand has also softened on days in the middle of the week, but has strengthened on peak days. A Reuters analysis of U.S. Transportation Security Administration data shows passenger traffic this year on average has fallen 14% on Tuesdays and Wednesdays compared with Mondays, and then it rebounds on Thursdays.Similarly, customers are booking trips well in advance compared with last year, leading to a moderation in ticket sales close to the date of travel. Citi's data shows that these so-called close-in ticket sales have moderated for a third straight week, but those for trips in June and July have improved.Those evolving patterns have forced companies to adjust.Frontier Airlines decided to slash flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays by about 20%, citing weak demand. It marks a shift from last year when some airlines said midweek was less of a trough.The Denver-based carrier attributed the change to flexible work arrangements, where more people are spending two to three days a week working in the office.""The most common two days in the office are Tuesdays and Wednesdays,"" said Daniel Shurz, a senior vice president at Frontier Airlines. ""That's why travel for leisure is the hardest on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.""Story continuesIn contrast, the ultra-low-cost carrier last week said its revenue per available seat mile on peak travel days is stronger than before the pandemic as customers are willing to pay a lot more to travel on the other days of the week.Frontier has eliminated an unspecified number of routes as part of its network restructuring. It now expects capacity this year to be up 19%-22% from last year compared with previously estimated growth of 23%-28%, resulting in higher operating costs.Changing travel patterns are also affecting United Airlines , which has a relatively small presence in the Caribbean and Florida where demand is usually strong in the winter.Since the Chicago-based carrier's network is more focused on business traffic, which has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, its revenue suffered in the last quarter. United last month said it wants to expand its Florida network.""We believe demand is just structurally different than it was pre-pandemic,"" CEO Scott Kirby said. ""We're still figuring out that new normal.""BUMPING AND OVERBOOKINGAirlines are also seeing a change in ticket sales.Passengers are booking flights earlier than they did through much of the pandemic, when travel restrictions and health concerns made planning in advance difficult.United said bookings for trips within 21 days are weaker than those beyond 21 days. Delta Airlines reported that bookings for trips inside 30 days were declining, while those outside 30 days were stronger.Carriers did not share comparative data for last year, but Southwest Airlines Co said bookings for trips closer to the departure date have weakened compared to last summer.Delta Air Lines Inc CEO Ed Bastian ascribed it to an attempt on the part of customers to lock in the opportunity to travel sooner as well as elimination of flight change fees by many airlines.It is having a cooling effect on domestic airfares.Data from online travel agency Hopper showed average domestic round-trip airfare declined 15% to $285 in April from last year.While the fare data has stoked concerns about consumer demand, Hopper's lead economist, Hayley Berg, said overall spending on travel has gone up.The waving of change fees, meanwhile, is encouraging people to revise plans at the last minute, affecting the proportion of seats sold, known within the industry as passenger load factor. Delta's load factor in the March quarter dropped by 4 percentage points from a quarter ago.To tackle this problem, Delta has said it now plans to overbook flights even more. The company declined to share its plans.The move runs the risk of bumping more passengers off flights.Last year, it denied boarding to more customers than American Airlines and United, U.S. Transportation Department data shows. However, except for two passengers, all the travelers voluntarily agreed to be paid to change their flights.""We had a lot of stability pre-pandemic,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein said. ""We're adjusting here into what I would call a new normal."" (Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)]"

(NYSE:PM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$5.9b last week. However, the 0.9% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Philip Morris International. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Philip Morris International. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Philip Morris International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Philip Morris International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$213m worth of shares.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliation. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.Story continuesKevin M. SteinGood morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '23 outlook.Then George and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products -- most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically. First, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content; second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology; third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders; fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy where we see a clear path to PE-like returns.And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital. As you saw from our earnings release, we had another strong quarter. Our Q2 results ran ahead of our expectation, and we once again raised our guidance for the year. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and trends are still favorable as demand for travel remains robust. Global domestic air traffic continues to lead the recovery, but international travel is also moving forward. China's air traffic has expanded significantly since its reopening in January, especially domestic air trap. However, there is still progress made for the industry as our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to prepandemic level since the demand for air travel is still slightly depressed from pre-COVID levels. In our business, we saw another quarter of substantial growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Revenues sequentially improved in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense, also bookings outpaced revenues for each of these market channels.EBITDA as defined margin improved to 51.3% in the quarter, contributing to the strong margin is our strict focus on our operating strategy and the ongoing recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues. Additionally, we generated about $130 million of operating cash flow in Q2 and ended the quarter with over $3.4 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. During the quarter, we agreed to acquire Calspan Corporation for approximately $725 million in cash. The acquisition we are happy to report closed yesterday, May 8. Calspan has established positions across a diverse range of aftermarket focused aerospace and defense development and testing services. Calspan has a state-of-the-art transonic wind tunnel that it utilizes to perform testing for both the commercial and defense aerospace markets. Calspan's unique service offerings exhibit the earnings stability and growth potential that are consistent with our aerospace components centered businesses. We are excited about the acquisition of Calspan and expect the business to meet or exceed our long-term value objectives.We expect the Calspan acquisition to contribute just over $100 million to our fiscal year '23 revenue. And for the Calspan EBITDA as defined margin in fiscal year '23 to be just less than half of the TransDigm total company margin. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we have a slightly stronger than typical pipeline of potential targets. As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I can't predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividend; a fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are currently evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&amp;A and capital markets are always difficult to predict. We continue to maintain significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future.Moving to our outlook for fiscal year '23. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '23 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results, the recent acquisition of Calspan and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. Please note that as the Calspan acquisition just closed on May 8, we utilized the limited information currently available to include Calspan within our guidance. Our preliminary expectations for Calspan will be refined as necessary over the coming months. At the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $300 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $150 million. The guidance assumes the continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets throughout the remainder of fiscal '23 and no additional acquisitions or divestitures. Our current year guidance is as follows and can be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is now $6.455 billion or up approximately 19%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the commercial OEM market and commercial aftermarket, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong second quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. We now expect commercial OEM revenue growth in the range of 20% to 25%, which is an increase from our previous guidance of mid-teens percentage range and expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the range of 25% to 30%, which is an increase from our previous guidance of high teens percentage range. The commercial aftermarket has been progressing well in our fiscal '23, and we hope that continues. However, we aim to be conservative with this guidance as the commercial aftermarket is harder to predict with many orders being book and ship and the advanced bookings only going out a few months or so into the future. Defense revenue guidance is still based on the previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions.We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate for defense at this time as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. We expect defense revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.26 billion or up approximately 23% with an expected margin of around 50.5%. This guidance includes about a 50 basis points of margin dilution from the DART Aerospace acquisition and just over 50 basis points of margin dilution from the recent Calspan acquisition. The pro forma margin dilution from Calspan, meaning if we had owned Calspan for all of fiscal year '23 is just over 100 basis points. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA as defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $23.75 or up approximately 39%.Mike will discuss in more detail shortly some other fiscal '23 financial assumptions and updates. We believe we are well positioned for the second half of fiscal year '23. We will continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. Let me conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain committed to driving value for our stakeholders. Now let me hand it over to Jorge to review our recent performance and a few other items.Jorge L. ValladaresThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the balance of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2022, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion includes the May 2022 acquisition of DART Aerospace in both periods. DART has been included in this market discussion since the third quarter of fiscal '22. The recent May 2023 acquisition of Calspan Corporation is excluded from this market discussion. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 25% in Q2 compared with the prior year period.Sequentially, total commercial OEM revenues grew by 17% and bookings improved over 15% compared to Q1. Bookings in the quarter were robust compared to the same prior year period and significantly outpaced sales. We're encouraged by the increasing commercial OEM production rates, while risks remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader Aerospace sector, we are cautiously optimistic that our operating units are well positioned to support the higher production [parts]. Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 38% in Q2 when compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q2.Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues increased by approximately 14%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were strong this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q2 bookings outpaced sales. Turning to broader market dynamics. Global revenue passenger miles remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, but have further progressed over the past few months. IATA recently commented that despite uncertain economic signals, demand for air travel continues to be strong across the globe, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.China air traffic specifically has seen a significant rebound after the lifting of COVID restrictions and the reopening of China to travel this past January. The recovery in domestic travel has made great strides over the past several months, primarily due to the sharp uptick in domestic air traffic in China in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for March global domestic air traffic was only down 1% compared to pre-pandemic. Similarly, U.S. domestic travel in March was also only 1% below pre-pandemic levels. Domestic travel in China was down about 3% in March compared to pre-pandemic, which is a significant improvement from being down 55% only 3 months ago in December. International traffic also continues to improve but at a slower pace than domestic. Approximately a year ago, international travel globally was depress about 52% and but in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for March, international travel was only down about 18% compared to pre-pandemic levels. International traffic in North America and Europe were within 3% and 14% of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Asia Pacific International travel was still down about 36%, but should hopefully continue to improve as the China reopening progresses.Global air cargo volumes in the most recent March IATA data continue to be lower year-over-year and versus pre-pandemic levels. With the continued growth in passenger flying, especially the widebody recovery, there's more belly hold space available for cargo transport. The reopening of China has been positive for the air cargo outlook but global trade signals continue to be mixed. It's too early to determine where air cargo trends stabilize.Business jet utilization is below the pandemic highs in 2021 and continues to moderate. Business jet activity does remain above pre-pandemic levels and business jet OEMs and operators forecast strong demand in the near term. We'll see how this normalizes over the upcoming months. Now shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 5% in Q2 when compared with the prior year period. Sequentially, total defense revenues grew by approximately 14%. Defense bookings are up this quarter compared to the same prior year period, and Q2 bookings solidly outpaced sales, which is a positive indicator for future defense order activity.Our defense market revenues continue to be impacted by the lag in U.S. government defense spend outlays. We continue to see steady improvement, but they still remain longer than historical average levels. Overall, our teams have made solid progress with the supply chain with the primary focus remaining on electronic component availability. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit percent range growth this year for our defense market revenues. Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by expressing how pleased I am by our operational performance in the second quarter of fiscal '23. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure, and executing with operational excellence.With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.Michael J. LismanGood morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on a few additional financial matters for the quarter and expectations for the full fiscal year. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the second quarter, our organic growth rate was 17.6%, driven by the continued rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket -- end markets. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define at TransDigm as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $350 million for the quarter. Below that free cash flow line, we saw net working capital consume just over $220 million of cash during the quarter as we build both accounts receivable and inventory to support the ongoing and continuing sales ramp-up on both the OEM and aftermarket side of the business. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.6x, down from 6x at the end of last quarter. Pro forma for the Calspan acquisition, which just completed yesterday we have $2.7 billion of cash and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 5.7x. On a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, that puts us below the 5-year pre-COVID average level of 6x. Additionally, our cash interest coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to interest expense, are currently in line with where we've historically operated and been comfortable operating the business.As always, we continue to watch the rising interest rate environment in the current state of the debt markets very closely. During the second quarter, we completed refis of 2 of our nearest maturity term loans, E&amp;S as well as the $1.1 billion senior secured 8% rate note that we took on at the outset of COVID (inaudible) have an abundance of caution. The net effect is that we extended the debt maturities out from 2025 into 2028. While we ended up not needing the proceeds of that $1.1 billion insurance policy note, as we called it to withstand the COVID downturn, we felt it was prudent to have the excess cash as we headed into those tough times. We'll continue to operate the business with that kind of conservatism when it comes to our capital structure and good times and bad and expect to remain proactive and prudent. Pro forma for this note refinancing and term loan extension, our nearest maturity is now 2026. As a result of these various refinancings, we had some puts and takes on interest expense, the net impact of which is that our interest expense estimate for FY '23 ticked up slightly, as you can see in today's updated guidance.Over 75% of our total $20 billion gross debt balance is fixed or hedged through fiscal '26, and this is achieved through a combination of fixed great notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term. Specifically on the interest rate hedging point, you'll see some detail on the 10-Q on new hedges that we put in place during this past quarter to extend our coverage out another year through fiscal '26. One special note on the cash mechanics of the debt refi due to the way the timing worked, we had $1.1 billion of restricted cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, but that cash was dispersed just after quarter end in the first couple of days of April when we successfully completed the retirement of the 8% bond I mentioned.So as of today, as it pertains to our balance sheet, the restricted cash balance as well as the amount due on that 8% (inaudible) debt note are both zero. As we sit here today, from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&amp;A or return cash to our shareholders via buybacks or dividends during fiscal '23. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnKevin, I noticed you said something -- it seemed a little different this time about the M&amp;A pipeline and that it's perhaps a little bit better than it's been. And I'm wondering, is that because more properties are for sale or there's fewer competitors out there bidding against you because of the financing environment. What's going on there?Kevin M. SteinYes. I think there's more properties available, more coming available, things that have long been rumored, have come to market or we now know or definitively coming. So that certainly sets up favorably for us.Robert Michael SpingarnAnd how about the pricing environment within that?Kevin M. SteinI've not noted any difference in pricing, maybe things have come down ever so slightly. But they're still going for high multiples people remember what they can command or what they could and are still expecting that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonI was wondering, Kevin, if you can comment on the source of the OEM upside in the guidance being raised, I can follow the aftermarket, but what's getting better on the OEM side?Kevin M. SteinI'll give you my thoughts and Jorge and chime in, but the build rates are improving, deliveries are improving, and we're finally starting to see the order book build on the OEM side. So that's really the genesis of it.Jorge L. ValladaresYes, I'd echo Kevin's comments. Generally, there's some level of offset from the OE production rate increases to when the sub-tiers in our business sees that demand. So we're cautiously optimistic that they are moving the rates up, and we'll continue to produce more aircraft as we go forward in the future.Myles Alexander WaltonOkay. And then 1 for Mike (inaudible) working capital consumption, $220 million in the quarter, and I think it was a slight source in the first quarter. What's the expectation for the full year at this point?Michael J. LismanIt's hard to say exactly how it plays out over the course of the year from peak to drop during COVID, about $400 million came out. If you look at the math around that, we're close to all of that having gone back in, not quite there, but pretty close. So it's hard to give exact guidance by quarter. But I think we're getting closer to the max amount that should be back in there. So we don't expect to see a sizable uptick of the type we saw this past quarter in future quarters.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays.David Egon StraussKevin, so it looks like if we just look on revenue that the -- your aftermarket revenues are now back to 120, 120 -- 20%, 25% above pre-pandemic levels. Where do you think volumes are at this point on the aftermarket side relative to pre-pandemic levels?Kevin M. SteinYes. I think you're right in what you're saying about the percentage of. But I still think we're 10% to 15% volume light in our numbers. That's still has the potential to come in as people fly more. And that gets us back to really where we were pre-COVID.David Egon StraussOkay. And any comments on supply chain? I know you've pointed out some issues in the past. How would you characterize your supply chain 3 months further on now?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I think our supply chain has done a nice job recovering and trying to support the ramp-up. I think in general terms, we've seen a more stable and predictable performance out of the suppliers -- electronic components, as I mentioned, continue to be a little bit of a minor pain point. But I'd say, generally, that's getting better as well.David Egon StraussOkay. And what about your ability to hire and retain relative to maybe 3, 6 months ago?Jorge L. ValladaresSure. Yes. I don't think we really run into any significant retention issues through this process. Definitely, we've seen the overall labor market improve at most of our locations in terms of the production labor still a little bit tight on the higher technical and engineering expertise. But again, a little bit of signs of improvement there as well.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardKevin, I'll start with you. First of all, on the aftermarket, clearly, very strong growth here and in the most recent quarters. But just looking forward, how sustainable do you think this is, particularly as you start to lap that price increase towards the end of the year and also given these very low rates of old aircraft retirement?Kevin M. SteinWell, I guess we'll have to see how the order book continues to evolve. Of course, as we it all depends on takeoff and landings. And if the flight activity continues to increase, then we'll see continued strength. I think we're just seeing the opening innings really of China coming back, and it's good to see that in the numbers.But it's hard to put any parameters on it from here, except we do expect things to continue to improve for the year, but it will have to slow down at some point as OEMs start to ship more, but we'll have to see how that unfolds.Robert Alan StallardOkay. And then a follow-up for Mike on the interest rates. On the debt market, there's been some -- what might be optimistic chat about interest rates actually coming down going forward from here. I was wondering what your thoughts might be on that? And what sort of flexibility TransDigm has to adjust interest rates if that does occur?Michael J. LismanYes. We -- generally, with regards to capital structure and interest rates, we don't take a strong position on where they're going to go. As we've said before, we're in the business of focusing on keeping on-time delivery and quality of our parks as high as we can rather than trying to predict where rates might go. That said, this past call -- this past quarter, we did take a bit of a different approach. And when we did the new hedges, we did collars rather than swaps so that if rates do float down a bit, we'll get some of that benefit down to about a 2% SOFR rate.So you'll see some of that detail in the 10-Q when it's filed later this week. And then as always, I mean, we can -- if the overall market rates did step back by 2 to 3 percentage points, you can go in and refi, right? We can reprice our bank debt, of which we've still got $6 billion or so and bring down the rate on that. And we can also, if it makes sense, take out some of the fixed notes. There's a breakage cost on the latter, but it's just math. And if the rates come down enough, you could take out those notes earlier pay the prepayment penalty so that you get the benefit of the lower rates going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is Jordan (inaudible) on for Ron. I just had a question on Calspan. I know you guys said that the financial profile fit the M&amp;A targets that you guys pursue but the company being services based, should we view it as a departure in your strategy or a shift? And also, should we expect more services to be in your pipeline?Kevin M. SteinI don't think we expect any change in our approach. Our approach is always to deliver private equity-like returns to our shareholders. When we find businesses that are highly proprietary, highly engineered and produce a highly engineered product, in this case, a testing report. I think it absolutely lends itself to our products. And we'll see how successful we are with this acquisition and certainly opens us up to other markets we might explore within aerospace and defense, but you shouldn't interpret this as any new direction for us. We find that this business should produce the same types of returns as we've come to expect from our components businesses. Jorge, do you have anything to comment on that?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I would add, as we -- we're very excited about the acquisition. At first day, excited that we closed it yesterday. But as we evaluated the opportunity, we saw many of the characteristics and attributes that we've seen in other businesses that we've acquired. They do very highly engineered proprietary testing. They are a great partner with their customer base, primarily aerospace and defense, which we like as well. And there was no fudging the numbers or changing any type of criteria as we evaluated it. We expect it to perform as other acquisitions, past acquisitions have performed and generate the typical returns that we did. So we're very excited about it.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluIt's Sheila -- usually people mess up my last name, but.Kevin M. SteinI thought she was great. So I have to tell you.Jaimie StemenOn the last call, you pointed out volumes were 85% below 2019 levels, implying price of about 25% since 2019, Kevin. So I think in response to (inaudible) question, you implied price is another 10 to 15 points of plus up this quarter. is that just rounding? Or is the shortage of new planes?Kevin M. SteinExactly, I think, what I was referring to, and I apologize if I'm confused. I was simply saying there's still 10% to 15% of missing volume, if you look back to the pre-COVID levels. We don't comment on price to that extent. So I'm just looking at it from a volume point of view. We still -- there are still flight activity that has not returned that we anticipate will over the coming year or so. But we don't anticipate all the volume to return in '23. Some of it will fall into '24, we fully anticipate.Sheila Karin KahyaogluOkay. No, that's helpful. And then maybe just post '23. And as you think about '24 and '25, what's like the normalized afterward outlook you guys are thinking about on a volume basis and then opportunities beyond that?Kevin M. SteinGo ahead, Mike.Michael J. LismanI think, Sheila, on that point, we'll give guidance when we give it. We're just getting started with our detailed bottoms-up op unit forecast here for the next 12 months, this coming month or so. And I think we don't want to get out over our skis in terms of predicting where commercial at market volumes could go from here. Things are still changing quickly. And as we've said all along, the recovery could be lumpy here.Kevin M. SteinAnd again, Sheila, as you know, we do a bottoms-up forecasting. So we don't give our teams expectations. We allow them to tell us, and I think that has proven to be more accurate than announcements from on high.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC CM.Kenneth George HerbertKevin, when you look at the sort of the update and the increase to the full year aftermarket guide for fiscal '23, it sounds like it's pretty broad-based in China and some other tailwinds there. But is it possible as you look at that increase to maybe rank order or prioritize for us maybe what drove the increase or where you're seeing the greatest impact?Kevin M. SteinI'll let Jorge take that one.Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I think as you guys know, we have no visibility into the inventory or specific trends in a particular region per se. Our largest submarket, which is the passenger submarket is seeing that bounce back in that growth, and we're seeing it across multiple operating units while cargo is down, we are seeing some improvement in terms of the belly cargo on some of those businesses as well.So I would say generally, all of our operating units that support the commercial aftermarket are seeing the rebound in the recovery.Kenneth George HerbertGreat. And within that, are you seeing anything in particular on the interior side when I think of some of the businesses there and I think about maybe retrofit opportunities on wide-body aircraft, is that a doing better than the passenger trend? Or how is that looking?Jorge L. ValladaresI would say interiors are following a similar trend. We're seeing a nice recovery there. We've probably seen that over the last few quarters, generally. But obviously, as they continue to utilize the existing fleet, that's beneficial for potential down the road modifications and refurbs, et cetera.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen.Gautam J. KhannaJust to follow up on the last couple of questions on -- are you seeing any -- can you -- any differences in aftermarket demand across kind of traditionally discretionary products versus flight-critical or any submarkets, whether it be helos or what have you that are weaker or stronger than others? Any sort of flavor you can give us.Jorge L. ValladaresNo. I think in general, the majority across operating units are participating in the recovery. There could be some puts and takes across any given quarter. But we're not seeing any significant differences in the commercial aftermarket there. And I think -- maybe to add to that, commercial transport is stronger, than the business jet and helicopter but business jet and helicopter aftermarket is very strong as well. And a small portion of our overall aftermarket revenue, as you know.Gautam J. KhannaYes. And maybe, Kevin, could you speak to your comfort with leverage in this environment? Like -- for the right deal, how much would you be willing to pick up the debt-to-EBITDA ratio?Kevin M. SteinI think we're comfortable operating in the same range as we have historically. As Mike said, we don't get into forecasting. We run our business. We make sure we have enough available cash. And for any available opportunity that we see on the horizon and that we can go after it. So I don't see any limitations. I think we're comfortable operating within the same range as we historically have, 5 to 7x. We're right in that sweet spot. I think this is where we would like to continue to operate in. As you heard, there's probably some forecast that rates will start to go down in the not-too-distant future. This is good. We have successfully navigated this so far, and we will continue to come out the other side stronger. So I feel like we're comfortable where we are. Mike, do you have anything you want to add to that?Michael J. LismanNo, I think that's right. As we've said many times before, we feel comfortable in sort of the 6x area. And then it's always dependent on not just the leverage level, right, but how far out to the right can you kick the maturities? That's as important a part of the equation is just what the overall leverage level is, and we always try to manage that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.Peter J. ArmentKevin, maybe just a quick 1 on just price, your ability to kind of still pass along price. Any changes that you've seen as kind of volumes and overall activity has picked up. Just curious in this inflationary environment.Kevin M. SteinThis is still an inflationary environment. I don't see any changes. Our goal is to as always, to pass along inflation that's what we try to do. I think we've all seen reports from the airlines of ticket price increases and the like. So I would say all of the market has been successful in passing this along as we have needed to perform.Peter J. ArmentOkay. And just a quick follow-up. On China, overall, less than 10% or around 10% of your overall mix in terms of revenue?Kevin M. SteinWell, we don't give geographic splits. We don't actually know. We sell a lot of that through distribution and OEM. So we don't actually know. I think the way to model it is to look at what is missing from the flight activity from pre-COVID to now, and that gives you an idea of what's still missing from our business. And there's still -- as Jorge alluded to in his remarks, there's still a chunk of China flying activity that hasn't materialized yet, but certainly looks like it will.Jorge L. ValladaresThe international obviously is still lagging considerably compared to the domestic, but it's moving in the right direction.OperatorScott Deuschle with Credit Suisse.Scott DeuschleJorge, does your pricing model move at all in response to airline profitability, given the value-based approach, meaning if airlines continue to become more profitable kind of on their current course, could we see you exercise your pricing power in a manner that's perhaps greater than what you've historically done relative to inflation, but which is consistent with your value-based model since the airlines are generating more profit per takeoff and landing cycle?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I'd say airline profitability doesn't really come into play. As we've always stated, our pricing objectives is to market base the price and do better than inflation. So obviously, with the higher inflationary environment, we're trying to get real price on top of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and some of the costs that are flowing through the business. But we don't start looking at the profitability of the customer base or anything like that.Scott DeuschleOkay. And then just following up on Calspan, do you have a sense for which of the 3 value drivers will have the most impact on driving accretion there? And then on the price side, is there an ability to achieve price realizations at Calspan quickly? Or does that company have a lot of backlog and you to work through before you can start to get price?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I would say our view on value creation is it's a 3-legged stool, right? We're trying to make sure that we're getting the price to reflect the value of the products that we see. We're always trying to make sure we're managing the cost structures and pulling costs out of the business. And then we want to be able to provide innovative profitable solutions to the customer base. And that's not going to change with Calspan. And frankly, that's not going to change across any of the portfolio of companies that we own. So obviously, we just closed on the acquisitions -- but we're going to be looking to leverage all 3 in the process. It's a great business. It's been well managed and run and our hope is to be able to optimize it like we've been able to do with past acquisitions.Scott DeuschleOkay. And last question, Kevin, just a clarification. You said the M&amp;A pipeline is stronger than typical. As you define typical here, are you referring to the past few years as your reference period? Or are you saying the M&amp;A pipeline is stronger than it's typically been across the longer-term experience of TransDigm?Kevin M. SteinYes, I would take me at face value there. It's typical than what we've traditionally experienced. And more so than the last couple of years. There's a lot in the pipeline right now, and the team is busy. But you cannot -- that doesn't linearly project closings, of course, but we're very busy right now.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanWanted to ask about the, obviously, very strong profitability in the quarter, and I believe not necessarily guidance for any specific year. But as a framework, the company has a philosophy that in a normal year, it's possible to have roughly 100 basis points of margin expansion with the same set of businesses. Is there any reason to think that, that shouldn't be the case for next year off of wherever 2023 comes out?Kevin M. SteinI think that when things stabilize, when we get back to normality, whatever that looks like, I think a 100 to 150 basis points expansion per year on margin apples-to-apples is always what we have modeled and tried to achieve. And I think that's a fantastic target.Seth Michael SeifmanOkay. Okay. Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up with regard to the M&amp;A pipeline, we see some pretty solid valuations in the public markets these days. A lot of activity in the private market, obviously. To what extent do you see that being driven by valuation? And does that kind of inhibit things at all over? Is there still kind of plenty of value out there?Kevin M. SteinI think there's plenty of value out there. I don't -- given our ability to generate value, I think we don't turn away when prices go up necessarily as long as we remain convicted with the individual property products. So the value what we have to pay doesn't factor in to too much. So we're not concerned. If prices stay high, go higher -- when you find a business that matches the criteria that we look for highly engineered products, you're going to have a successful run with those kinds of products over their lifetime.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.Michael Frank CiarmoliKevin, just to go back to Scott's question on Calspan, I think you said the EBITDA margin about half of what you're doing now, just given that these are more services, is there a path do you think to get these margins up to kind of TransDigm historical levels? Or is there anything with the type of services and testing that they provide that would prevent you from driving that margin?Kevin M. SteinI think we're in the early innings here and difficult to comment too much. I don't know if this business gets to the average of TransDigm, but I would, I guess, argue that it doesn't have to. As long as we continue to find pathways to private equity-like returns, I don't know if the business has to get to TransDigm average margins. But there's no reason to believe any business in the aerospace sector that is highly engineered, produces a technical product like what we specialize in, that it couldn't get there. But right now, we're not modeling it that it definitely will, but we'll have to see. There's lots of room for value generation.Michael Frank CiarmoliOkay. Perfect. And then just on the defense market, can you give any additional color there? Maybe parse out OEM growth, aftermarket growth? I know you might have some more of the consumable exposure there, but any noticeable or discernible trends within defense marketplace?Jorge L. ValladaresYes, I'll take that. As you know, we really don't separate out the defense OE from the aftermarket. I think both are performing relatively equally in terms of how they're tracking. It's a difficult environment as the government continues to do its best to support Ukraine and figure out how they're going to spend funds. So I think our the general commentary that I provided in the opening in terms of we're seeing a slow but steady improvement in the outlays, but the fact remains the outlays are still a little bit in terms of solicitations closing into orders as we look at the historical time frames.Michael Frank CiarmoliGot it. And then just last 1 on that topic. Are you able to get real pricing in your defense markets? Or are you grappling with some of the same issues where we're seeing and hearing about, about firm fixed prices, just not being able to pass through those costs until the contracts reopen or you get new task orders?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I really don't want to comment or get into specific contract terms. As you know, each of our operating unit independently negotiates the contracts with the government, and I would be speaking out of turn.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagSo hearing from some of the MRO facilities, we're hearing that aircraft turnaround times at extending from 3 months to maybe even as long as 6 months, and part of that is still from some part shortages and then some from labour. Can you talk about how this environment is benefiting your pricing power? And -- is that something -- and if you are, is that something that you could sustain for longer?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. I don't know that we'd have any comments specific to that environment benefiting pricing, again, as I've stated many times, our pricing philosophy remains unchanged. And -- it's based on a market-based value for the products that we deliver and design and produce. And we look to realize real pricing on top of inflation. And I think that has been something that's very consistent in the history of the company, and that's how we continue to approach it.Kristine Tan LiwagGreat. If I could [attack] on second question here. So when you think about available parts, when you think about the order activity that you have in the market, what percent of those orders do you -- are you able to deliver on? And are there any specific shortages that you're facing in terms of providing through the market?Jorge L. ValladaresYes. Each business and each operating unit has its own stated lead times that they provide to the end users and the airline customers when they come in for any particular demand in those lead times can vary based on operating units. In general, given the recovery that we've seen in the aftermarket in the commercial transport aftermarket, specifically, we've tried to invest in some inventory to be able to support the customer base. And off-hand, I'm not aware of any specific pain points in terms of supplying airlines are turning around spares activity. Again, as a general comment, electronic component availability is still a little bit tight. But the teams have been doing a nice job managing through that.OperatorAt this time, I would now like to turn it back to Jaimie Stemen for closing remarks.Jaimie StemenThank you all for joining us today. This concludes the call. We appreciate your time, and have a good rest of your day.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

That's according to a joint statement. Yahoo Finance's Diane King Hall joins us now to dive deeper into the case. So what was this all about?DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. Well, it's a big payday for women with long patience who once worked for the firm. Goldman Sachs has agreed to fork over $215 million to settle years-long gender pay bias allegations. The settlement covers around 2,800 female associates and vice presidents who were employed at the powerhouse bank beginning in 2002.It was the banking sector's longest-running battle over pay disparity. A discrimination complaint which led to the case was first filed in 2005, but the allegations go back further. The suit was first brought in 2010 by three former Goldman employees. The initial complaint alleges that Goldman's, quote, ""discriminatory practices"" favored men and that, as a result, women made less money, received weaker performance reviews, and were promoted less frequently.This case came down to the wire. It was set to go to trial next week. Now, for years, banks have pledged to diversify their ranks. Goldman's 2022 partner class was 29% women. By comparison, the 2020 class was 18% women. And going back to the settlement, in addition to the financial portion of the settlement, Goldman says it will hire outside experts to investigate its performance evaluation, promotion, and pay process for the next three years.BRAD SMITH: This is an industry that's known for having blowback. So, if one complains about unfair treatment--DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: --what does this indicate about the corporate workplace environments now?DIANE KING HALL: Well, it's certainly changing. Because once upon a time, you would have blowback for complaining. I mean, there were consequences in terms of your ability to be promoted, to secure better opportunities within the firm. But corporate culture is certainly changing in general.Story continuesOne and two, this comes in light of the pay-- excuse me-- the pay gap-- or pay transparency laws that have come into play in New York and California. So, certainly, there's something to be said about the greater context of pay transparency and this case reaching a resolution before going to trial. And also, it would put a greater microscope on Goldman and the banking industry if it were to go to trial.JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's own Diane King Hall. Thanks for tracking this story--DIANE KING HALL: All right. You got it.BRAD SMITH: --and bringing it to us.DIANE KING HALL: Thank you.]"

The plaintiffs in the case are women who worked for Goldman as an associate or vice president in the U.S. in the investment banking, investment management or securities divisions.The settlement covers about 2,800 female associates and vice presidents in Goldman's investment banking, investment management and securities divisions.“My goal in this case has always been to support strong women on Wall Street. I am proud that the result we achieved here will advance gender equity,” plaintiff Allison Gamba said in a prepared statement.Aside from the payment, the settlement includes a three-year period during which Goldman will work with an independent expert to perform more analysis on its performance evaluation processes, as well as its process for promoting individuals from vice president to managing director. It also requires an independent expert to conduct additional pay equity studies and for the New York City company to investigate and address any gender pay gaps where appropriate.“Goldman Sachs is proud of its long record of promoting and advancing women and remains committed to ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace for all our people. After more than a decade of vigorous litigation, both parties have agreed to resolve this matter,"" said Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman Sachs global head of human capital management.

Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 47.2%.Net sales increased 10.0% year over year to $1.18 billion, which also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.15 billion and $1.16 billion, respectively. Excluding the negative currency impact, sales rose 13%. The upside was driven by strategic pricing actions undertaken by management during the quarter, sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma and the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian GoodStart infant formula brand. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and divested Latin American businesses. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 6.4% year over year.Shares of Perrigo were up 2% in pre-market trading on May 9, likely due to the better-than-expected earnings results.

Per management, the company gained market share in both business segments during the quarter compared with the year-ago period’s levels.CSCA: The segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2023 came in at $763.7 million, up 7.6% year over year, driven by acquisitions and strategic price increases. However, the upside was partially offset by two voluntary recalls during the quarter — one for a major national brand infant formula and another for an OTC product.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $418.1 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago period’s levels. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 23.6% year over year. Organically sales increased 4.0%. Segment revenues benefited from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands and strategic pricing actions. Sales were negatively impacted by an unfavorable currency movement.Story continues2023 GuidancePerrigo reiterated its financial guidance for 2023. Management expects to report net sales growth in the range of 7-11%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $2.50 and $2.70. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 21.5%, while the company expects to record interest expense of around $180 million.CEO RetirementIn a separate press release, the company also announced that its current president and chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Murray S.

For more thriller movies, head on over to 10 Best Thriller Movies on Netflix. The coronavirus pandemic dealt a devastating blow to a wide variety of industries. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and cruising all were sapped out of economic activity, since lockdowns and stay at home orders prevented people from engaging in the usual leisure activities. Another sector that was devastated was the film industry. Theaters and cinemas all over the world were shut down due to fears of the virus spreading. According to a report from The Motion Pictures Association (MPA), the Global Theatrical and Home Entertainment market was comfortably growing from 2016 to 2019. The sector had stood at $77.8 billion in 2016, grew to $83.7 billion the next year, and then went on to further grow to $92 billion in 2018 and $98.3 billion in 2019. In its final year of growth, the three sectors of the market, namely Physical, Digital, and Theatrical, had stood at $8.8 billion, $47.2 billion, and $42.3 billion, respectively. However, the very next year, the worst of the coronavirus would dawn on the sector, as it would go on to drop by 18% to $80.8 billion. However, this figure marked an internal shakeup within the industry, as while the Theatrical segment was nearly slaughtered to $12 billion, the Digital segment boomed to $61.8 billion.Zooming in on America, the country continued to be the largest geographical sector in the market, as its share was worth $32.2 billion. Within this segment, a whopping 82% was accounted for by the Digital segment, with Physical and Theatrical accounting for a mere 11% and 7%, respectively. In 2020, two of the top three movies were family films, as Frozen II and Jumanji: The Next Level took the top two spots. Courtesy of the virus, the online media industry maintained its boom from 2016, and went on to grow from 88.6 billion views in 2016 to a whopping 265.9 billion by the end of 2020. Surprisingly (or perhaps not), online television shows accounted for 92% of the total views. Compare this to the 78.9 billion views that online television shows brought in in 2016 and the difference that the pandemic made becomes clear.Story continuesResearchers from StrategyR show that the global box office industry was estimated to be worth $28.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.9% by the end of 2030 when it is expected to be worth $92.6 billion. StrategyR believes that within this market, the Action and Adventure subsegment will outpace the broader market in terms of growth, as its growth rate is expected to sit at 18% to make this section worth $49 billion in 2030. Geographically speaking, China is the fastest growing region, with a growth rate of 20.8%.Another report, this time from Gower Street, estimates that the global box office market can grow to $29 billion by the end of this year if it maintains a 12% growth rate, which will still be slower than the 21% growth rate achieved last year. At the same time, Gower Street points out that even if the global box market does grow to $29 billion, it will still be significantly less than the $42.3 billion that it was worth in 2019. The research firm also shares that the U.S. will continue to be the largest market in 2023, with an estimated value of $7.65 billion.The online content delivery market has risen to become of the dominant players in the industry, particularly since it was fueled by the coronavirus. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global video on demand market was worth $69.55 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $82.77 billion in 2022. From then until 2029, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% and sit at $257 billion by the end of the forecast period. This growth has made the market quite competitive as well, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) sharing a glimpse of the competition in its investor letter for the fourth quarter of 2022:We continue to operate in a highly competitive market as consumers have a vast number of entertainment choices. Beyond our direct streaming competitors, we also vie for consumers’ time against linear TV, YouTube, short form entertainment like TikTok, and gaming, to name just a few. The silver lining is that the market for entertainment is huge and Netflix is still very small by comparison. For example, in the more than 190 countries we operate in, our $30B+ of annual revenue compares against the combined annual estimated ~$300B pay TV/streaming industry, $180B branded TV advertising spend and $130 billion consumer spend on gaming .5It’s not easy to build a large and profitable streaming business. But we’re competing from a position of strength, as we lead the industry in terms of engagement, revenue and streaming profit. As a pure-play streaming company, we’re also not anchored to shrinking legacy business models, like traditional entertainment firms, allowing us to lean hard into the big growth opportunity ahead of us.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top thriller movies on Netflix.Best Thriller Movies On Netflixalin-surdu-j5GCqQM3eYA-unsplash (1)Our Methodology: We compiled our list by first narrowing down the top fifty thriller movies according to critics as ranked by Rotten Tomatoes.

Many, including Amazon’s The Rings of Power have decided to continue filming without writers or showrunners on set, but there’s limitations to what they can do.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesExisting scripts “must be shot EXACTLY as they were as of midnight on May 1. Not a word can be changed, cut, added, not a scene can be altered,” George R.R. Martin, a popular novelist and a member of the Writers’ Guild America (WGA) for his screenwriting work who is also on strike, explained in a May 7 blog post. “All that requires writing… and from now until the strike ends, the writers will be on picket lines, not on sets.”Picket lines are stirring up delays and disruptions. On the east coast, production on Showtime’s Wall Street drama Billions shut for a few hours amid picketing, as did filming for Paramount+ Evil’s fourth season and Apple TV+’s Severance. On the west coast, picketers paused the filming of the second season of Loot, the Apple TV+ series starring Maya Rudolph. In solidarity with the writers, Drew Barrymore dropped out of MTV Movie &amp; TV awards. The show, which aired on Sunday (May 7), was not only missing a host, but also a red carpet and press access.For many formats—late night shows, network series, and more—the pause will last until the strike ends. That’ll only happen if studios under the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) offer to reform pay, mini writers rooms, and more.Meanwhile, let’s take a look at where the show can’t go on, as of May 9—a week since the strike began.The shows that stopped productionThe second season of NBC comedy Night CourtThe second season of Unstable, the Netflix comedy series starring Rob Lowe and his son John Owen Lowe.Starz’s The Venery of Samantha Bird shut down production with two episodes out of eight left to filmSeason 3 of HBO Max/Universal TV hit comedy series Hacks has come to a standstill.The seventh season of Disney Channel’s longest-running live-action comedy series, Bunk’d, has been put on hold.Saturday Night Live stopped production indefinitely with three episodes left in its 48th season.Story continuesThe shows that closed writers roomsIt’s pens-down in Netflix’s Cobra Kai’s writing room, according to screenwriter Jon Hurwitz. The team is on the picket lines because “if A.I. wrote our show, it would have just been The Karate Man,” he tweeted.Starz’s Power Book III: Raising KananShowtime’s Yellowjackets folded for the time being after one day in the writing room.ABC’s Abbott Elementary, whose creator Quinta Brunson has shown support for the writers’ strike, is not working on season 3 before a resolution is found. The writer’s room on a Game of Throne prequel A Knight Of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight has closed because “Ira Parker and his incredible staff of young talents are on the picket lines,” Martin, author of the books that served as inspiration, wrote in his blogpost.Quotable: Netflix’s Stranger Things won’t start filming its fifth and final season until the WGA strike ends“Writing does not stop when filming begins. While we’re excited to start production with our amazing cast and crew, it is not possible during this strike. We hope a fair deal is reached soon so we can all get back to work. Until then—over and out. #wgastrong.”—Tweet by showrunners the Duffer BrothersThe flip side: Studios are suspending dealsAmazon, HBO, Warner Bros.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World.The immunotherapy industry is a rapidly growing field that is focused on developing treatments that harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer and other diseases. Many companies are involved in the immunotherapy industry, ranging from large pharmaceutical companies to small biotechnology startups. These companies are working to create a range of different immunotherapy treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. According to Markets and Markets, the revenue of the global immunotherapy drugs market was estimated to be $163.0 billion in 2020. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0% from 2020 to 2025, reaching a value of $274.6 billion by 2025. The global immunotherapy drugs market is classified based on therapeutic areas into cancer, autoimmune &amp; inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, and other therapeutic areas. Among these, cancer held the largest share of the global immunotherapy drugs market in 2019. The dominance of this segment is attributable to the high incidence of cancer, increasing research efforts in this field, and the provision of reimbursement coverage for oncology immunotherapies.The size of the global cancer immunotherapy industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% from $85.6 billion in 2020 to $309.67 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. The National Cancer Institute reported that in 2020, around 1,806,590 new cancer cases were reported in the United States, and 606,520 people died from the disease. Researchers believe that this rise in cancer incidence is expected to drive the growth of the immunotherapy industry in the coming years. In 2020, North America contributed the highest revenue to the cancer immunotherapy market due to increased expenditure on healthcare, a focus on maintaining a top healthcare system, and a rising incidence of cancer worldwide. Asia-Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to exhibit the highest CAGR during 2021-2030, primarily due to a surge in per capita income and an improvement in healthcare infrastructure.Story continuesSome of the key players in the immunotherapy industry include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Roche Holdings AG (ROG.SW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). These companies are investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) to bring new immunotherapy treatments to the market. The industry has witnessed significant progress in recent years in developing effective immunotherapies for various diseases. However, there are also challenges in the development of these treatments, including managing potential side effects and ensuring that they are accessible and affordable to patients worldwide.15 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the WorldPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 15 biggest immunotherapy companies in the world, we compiled a comprehensive list of companies that have a significant presence in the immunotherapy industry. This involved considering their involvement in immunotherapy research and development as well as their successful commercialization of immunotherapy products. Various factors such as product pipeline strength, market share, research and development efforts, product innovation, and global reach were considered to evaluate the commercial success of these companies. The companies have been ranked in ascending order based on their market capitalization as of April 28. We have also included the number of hedge fund holders for each of these companies as of Q4 2022.Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World15. Biogen Inc.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) became a household name during the pandemic as one of the first developers of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the stock sold off sharply as COVID momentum, including high expectations for booster shots, began to wear off, causing investors to slash its fiscal 2023 earnings estimates by two-thirds over the last year. We believe those downward revisions clouded the prospects for the company’s fully funded pipeline of platform opportunities, including cancer, RSV and flu. The cash-rich company also recently expanded its partnership with Merck to improve cancer treatments.”13.

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11.

(NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company. In a research note issued on February 14, Salim Syed at Mizuho increased the target for Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9.

Here’s what the firm said:“Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), which we referenced above, boasts a double digit free cash flow yield that gets divided roughly equally between repurchases, a dividend and M&amp;A in what is the best environment for acquisitions perhaps ever. In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”7.

(NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Amgen What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.55bUS$10.6bUS$9.62bUS$12.1bUS$13.1bUS$13.8bUS$14.4bUS$15.0bUS$15.5bUS$15.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.47%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$7.9kUS$9.1kUS$7.7kUS$9.0kUS$9.0kUS$8.8kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$7.8kUS$7.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$83bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.1%) = US$283bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$283b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$133bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$217b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$235, the company appears quite good value at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.966. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmgenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Biotechs market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

108,fe30b70b-e591-38a2-aa1c-b69bc50a4116,NEM,2023-05-10,3 Low-Volatility Stocks for a Stable Investment Strategy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-low-volatility-stocks-stable-104649825.html,1683370009,STORY,"['NEM', 'WMT']","[With another rate hike by the Fed, the markets remain in an uncertain zone. In all probability, the Fed will pause on rate hikes. However, it makes sense for investors to remain cautious. Indeed, considering heightened recession possibilities, turbulence in the financial sector, and inflation, the markets might continue to exhibit volatility. Therefore, having a portfolio based on a foundation of low-volatility stocks is important, for those who value capital preservation.In general, low-volatility stocks have a low beta and are blue-chip stocks. Besides providing capital preservation, these stocks also offer a healthy dividend yield. In addition, attractive valuations are a bonus, as total returns from these low-volatility stocks can be healthy over the next few years.Of course, it’s important to create a diversified portfolio. I would, however, recommend at least 50% exposure to blue-chip stocks. The remaining exposure can be towards high-quality growth stocks. This mix would be a stable investment strategy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss three low-volatility stocks with healthy total return potential.WMTWalmart$151.81AZNAstra Zeneca$75.27NEMNewmont Corporation$48.73Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart’s (NYSE:WMT) stock has traded relatively sideways over the last 12 months. Nevertheless, WMT stock is attractive, and in my view, the best pick among low-volatility stocks. Besides WMT stock’s low-beta status, there are a few other important reasons to like this top retailer.First, WMT stock offers a dividend yield of 1.5%, with a strong and stable growth outlook. Further, the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending, and retail sales are a key part of the consumption basket. With fears of recession, I expect policymakers to focus on boosting consumption spending. This will be positive for Walmart.It’s worth noting that for FY24, Walmart has guided for consolidated net sales growth of 2.5% to 3%. However, the company expects international net sales to increase by 6%. International markets are likely to remain the key growth driver for Walmart in the coming years.Story continuesFrom the perspective of shareholder returns, Walmart reported operating cash flow of $29.1 billion and free cash flow of $12.2 billion. Thus, this is a mega-cap stock with ample flexibility for dividends and share repurchases.Astra Zeneca (AZN)Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at SnackvikenSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.comIn general, bio-pharmaceutical stocks are low-volatility stocks. Astra Zeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is a top pick from the sector for two reasons. First, the stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 20.2-times. Additionally, AZN stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.6%.From a business perspective, Astra Zeneca has a pipeline of 178 drugs in various stages of clinical development. In addition, more than 30 Phase 3 trials are due in 2023. An attractive pipeline of drugs will ensure that the company’s revenue growth remains strong.Considering its pipeline, Astra Zeneca expects low double-digit revenue growth through 2025. However, the company expects to deliver growth above the industry average, even beyond this period.Astra Zeneca is also well-diversified from a geographical perspective. As of 2022, the company reported 60% of its revenue from the U.S. and Europe. Accordingly, emerging markets will increasingly contribute to its growth over the next few years.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is an undervalued low-beta stock worth holding in a core portfolio. Gold has been trending higher with fears around inflation, a recession, and geopolitical tensions. Therefor, I think now is a great time to remain invested in gold miners.NEM stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 19.7-times. Additionally, the stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.1%. If gold remains in an uptrend, attractive dividend growth seems likely. To put things into perspective, Newmont expects to report a $400 million increase in free cash flow for every $100 increase in the price of gold.With 96 million ounces of reserves, Newmont holds impressive high-quality assets. This will ensure stable production in the coming years. Newmont has also guided for a reduction in its all-in-sustaining-cost over the next three years. This will ensure EBITDA margin expansion, even if gold trades sideways. Newmont is positioned to create sustained shareholder value with a solid and stable investment-grade balance sheet.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

111,aac4f15e-6ab1-3723-83ee-5585daeb8d6e,GD,2023-05-10,What Does General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-general-dynamics-corporations-nyse-130023810.html,1683637223,STORY,['GD'],"[Let's talk about the popular General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$235 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$209. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether General Dynamics' current trading price of US$211 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at General Dynamics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics Is General Dynamics Still Cheap?Great news for investors – General Dynamics is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $306.18, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. General Dynamics’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will General Dynamics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for General Dynamics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GD for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about General Dynamics as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

112,5fe2301a-e7d8-3e81-b520-186776bd68ec,NOV,2023-05-10,"Nov Inc. (NOV) Loses -14.29% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why a Trend Reversal May be Around the Corner",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nov-inc-nov-loses-14-133501555.html,1683639301,STORY,['NOV'],"[Nov Inc. (NOV) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 14.3% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why NOV Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of NOV shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.53. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for NOVThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NOV has increased 10.2%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, NOV currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.I will now turn the line over to Cameron -- I'm sorry, to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.Julie Cameron-DoeThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.Craig Scott BillingsThanks, Julie. Afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we get into the specifics of the quarter, I'm pleased to say that after 3 years of suspension, today, we announced that we are resuming payment of a quarterly dividend, initially $0.25 per share. We have a number of growth projects in flight that require capital and will ultimately add meaningful EBITDA to our business. But with Macau returning to profitability and North America continuing to perform well above historical levels, we have sufficient financial flexibility to also return capital to shareholders.I also want to express appreciation to our 27,000-plus team who were once again recently recognized by Forbes Travel Guide with 24 Five Star Awards, the most of any independent hotel company in the world. Thank you for all that you do. Turning to Las Vegas. I have to tell you, it's a fascinating time in our business. Despite the confluence of high inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and increasingly difficult year-over-year comps, Wynn Las Vegas delivered an all-time record in Q1 with $232 million of adjusted property EBITDA, supported by a consumer that continues to feel flush. We also subsequently delivered the best April in the history of the property. We continue to invest heavily in people, programming and the building to further distance ourselves as the clear leader in luxury in Vegas. Looking ahead, we currently have a strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power, healthy drop in handle and a robust programming calendar, particularly in the back half of the year. Yet I continue to watch the macro factors that I mentioned earlier, and I will note that with Q2 '23, we will begin comping against some very strong prior year quarters.Lastly, just as I have the past several quarters, I will continue to tell you exactly what we're seeing. And right now, things feel good around here. Turning to Boston. Like Vegas, Encore had a strong quarter, generating $63 million of EBITDA. We saw strength across the casino in terms of table drop, slot handle and overall GGR. On the nongaming side, we delivered strong hotel revenue driven by both ADR and occupancy. The strength has continued into Q2 with EBITDA per day in April, largely consistent with trends we have experienced over the past few quarters. We also launched retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor in Q1, which helped drive a 20% increase in sign-ups to our Wynn Rewards loyalty program year-to-date. I expect the book will continue to be a significant driver for new customer acquisition over time. On the development front in Boston, we finalized the interiors and began to buy out structural materials for our upcoming projects across the street from the property that will add incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities. Turning to Macau. We generated $156 million of EBITDA in the quarter with lower-than-normal VIP hold negatively impacting EBITDA by about $10 million. In the casino, mass table drop reached 82% of Q1 2019 levels, and our VIP hold normalized market share was over 14% during the quarter despite unusually low hold in our mass business at Wynn Macau and the fact that significant portions of Wynn Macau's East casino were closed for renovation during the quarter. Encouragingly, that market share was consistent with full year 2019 levels. On the nongaming side, our retail business was incredibly strong with tenant retail sales increasing 60% compared to the first quarter of 2019, once again highlighting the strength of our premium consumer. Looking forward, as you have seen, market-wide GGR momentum in Macau has been very impressive, building through the first quarter and accelerating into April. Who would have thought even 6 months ago that the market would be run rating north of $22 billion of annual GGR. In April, our mass drop per day increased versus Q1, our direct VIP turnover per day increased meaningfully versus Q1, and occupancy and retail sales were very healthy. More recently, the May Golden Week holiday period was particularly strong, outperforming Golden Week 2019 in several key areas. In the casino, our overall mass table drop during the holiday period was nearly 10% above 2019 Golden Week levels, and our direct VIP turnover was more than double 2019 levels. Outside of gaming, our tenant retail sales increased 36% compared to Golden Week 2019, and our hotel occupancy was 95%. Performance during and after the quarter was skewed towards Wynn Palace driven both by the mix of customers that have returned to Macau in the initial reopening wave and the renovation-related closures of Wynn Macau that I mentioned earlier. We are making a number of changes and improvements to Wynn Macau that I expect will drive longer-term market share gain. In the meantime, I expect that Wynn Palace will continue to pace ahead of Wynn Macau in the recovery. On the development front in Macau, we are deep into design and planning for our concession-related CapEx commitments, which we believe will help support Macau's long-term diversification goals and be additive to our business over the coming years. We look forward to telling you more in due course. Lastly, I hope that you were all able to review the information we provided a couple of weeks ago on Wynn Al Marjan Island, our planned integrated resort in the UAE. If you haven't listened to the presentation or read through the slide deck, you can find both on our IR website. I'm incredibly proud of the program and design elements we have put together thus far. And as we noted in the presentation, we think the resort will generate between $450 million and $600 million of steady-state EBITDA. The combination of our 40% equity ownership in the project along with our management and license fees will drive a very healthy ROI for Wynn Resorts shareholders. With that, I'll now turn it back to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter.Story continuesJulie Cameron-DoeThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated an all-time record of $231.6 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $586.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter. Higher-than-normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $4 million in Q1. Our hotel occupancy was 88.8% in the quarter, up 1,190 basis points year-over-year and up 620 basis points versus Q1 2019. Importantly, we've stayed true to our luxury brand and continue to compete on quality of product and service experience with our overall ADR reaching a record $493 during Q1 '23, up 14.1% versus Q1 '22 and 46% above Q1 2019 levels. Our other nongaming businesses saw broad-based strength across food and beverage, entertainment and retail, which were up nicely year-over-year and also well above pre-pandemic levels. In the casino, our Q1 '23 slot handle increased 33.5% year-over-year and with 99% of our Q1 2019 level. Similarly, our table drop was up 9.6% year-over-year and was 49% of our Q1 2019 levels. The team in Vegas has done a great job of controlling costs without negatively impacting the guest experience, delivering adjusted property EBITDA margin of 39.5% in the quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, our EBITDA margin was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year at approximately 1,400 basis points compared to Q1 2019. OpEx excluding gaming tax per day was $3.7 million in Q1 '23, which was flat sequentially and up 20% compared to Q1 2019 levels but well below the 46% increase in operating revenues. Turning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $63.4 million with EBITDA margin of 29.3%. We saw broad-based strength across casino and nongaming during the quarter. In the casino, we generated $191 million of GGR, a property record with strength in both tables and slots. Our nongaming revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $50.9 million with particular strength in hotel and food and beverage. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx excluding gaming tax per day of approximately $1.17 million in Q1 '23. This is up relative to Q1 '22 on increased business volumes and flat sequentially. As we've discussed on prior calls, the year-over-year EBITDA and OpEx comps were impacted by contractual labor agreements, which added around $45,000 per day to our OpEx base beginning late in Q2 '22. We're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as we continue to grow the top line over time. Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $155.8 million in the quarter on $600.1 million of operating revenues. Lower-than-normal VIP hold negatively impacted EBITDA by around $10 million in Q1. As Craig noted, we were encouraged by the meaningful uptick in visitation and demand we experienced during the quarter with particular strength in mass casino and luxury retail sales. Our OpEx excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.3 million per day in Q1, a decrease compared to $3.2 million in Q1 2019 and up modestly from Q4 despite meaningful sequential increase in business volumes. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs, and we're well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the business recovers over time. In terms of CapEx, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted last quarter, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx in the very near term. As such, for 2023, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $50 million to $220 million. Turning to Wynn Interactive. Our EBITDA burn rate decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $21.1 million in Q1 '23. Our team continues to stay disciplined on cost while driving improved marketing efficiencies. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of approximately $4.7 billion as of March 31. This was comprised of $1.6 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $3.1 billion in the U.S. Importantly, the combination of very strong performance in Las Vegas and Boston with the properties generating over $1.1 billion of adjusted property EBITDA in the 12 months through March 31, together with our robust liquidity, creates a very healthy leverage profile in the U.S. As Craig noted, with our properties performing well in each of our markets and our robust liquidity, we're pleased to announce that the Board approved the resumption of our quarterly dividend with a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on June 6, 2023, to stockholders of record as of May 23, 2023, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $124 million primarily related to the spa and villa renovations and F&amp;B enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.Carlo SantarelliCraig, as you talked about kind of some of the work you guys are doing on the Peninsula at that asset, how much of the, I guess, trailings of that asset relative to Cotai is related to the work versus how much of the overall recovery that you've experienced or the market has experienced in Cotai? How much is the Peninsula kind of lagged that? And what do you think or what do you think it takes to kind of narrow that gap in the resumption of kind of attempting to attain '19 levels in both geographies?Craig Scott BillingsSure. No problem. Carlo, thanks for the question. So first, it's important to note, we don't normalize for mass hold. And so when we talk about normalized numbers, they don't include any unusually low hold of that. And we did hold low in mass at Wynn Macau in the quarter.But certainly, and I called it out for a reason, Wynn Palace is leading the charge amongst our 2 properties as the market comes back. There's really a few factors at play. I think everybody who follows Macau closely knows that GGR and visitation were somewhat disconnected in the initial wave in that you had a lot of dedicated players come back. A lot of those players -- well all -- most of those players are rated players. And they weren't coming with tour groups. They were coming as individual visitors and they disproportionately, at least within our business, ended up at Wynn Palace on Cotai when Macau historically has been more exposed to our group business, general unrated business, et cetera, et cetera. So I'm not surprised from that perspective that Wynn Palace led Wynn Macau. That's the first point.The second point is that there are a number of changes that we're making to Wynn Macau, the property needs to be refreshed, and we're making those changes now. We did start those in Q1, including some pretty significant refreshment of the East casino there, which disrupted significant numbers of pits concurrently. They were effectively closed during the quarter. So that also had an impact.So I think as the market continues to recover, as more unrated play comes back to the market, as more tour groups come back to the market, then we'll get the natural benefit downtown. And then, of course, we're trying to make the property the best that it can be to take as much market share as we possibly can. But in the interim, as I said, I would expect Palace to lead Wynn Macau.Carlo SantarelliThat's helpful. And then as a follow-up, Obviously, there's plenty of development activity. There's obviously some spend on Cotai and your contributions down the road for the UAE development. What was the primary thought process and driving factors and the decision to reinstitute the dividend?Craig Scott BillingsWell, thanks, Carlo. Yes, the dividend, we -- as we always talk about with our investors, the dividend is the cornerstone of our capital return strategy. And the U.S. business is generating plenty of cash flow. Macau is coming back quickly. And so now we are doing exactly what you just alluded to. We're balancing these high-ROI development projects in Boston and the UAE.We're preserving a bit of capital related to New York City to the extent that, that advances and on the other side, our desire to reimplement that dividend and return capital. So we felt like this initial dividend was a great place to start. And from there, stay tuned. We'll see how we grow it over time.OperatorOur next caller is Joe Greff with JPMorgan.Joseph Richard GreffCraig, it looks like EBITDA margins on net revenues in Macau in March were about 30%. I just want to make sure if my math is right on that. And then when I just look at overall OpEx growth versus net or gross gaming or gross revenue growth, it looks like OpEx growth is approximately half of revenue growth. Do you think that can continue? Or do you think OpEx growth is lagging because of labor constraints and maybe other nuance things in the Macau marketplace?Craig Scott BillingsWell, I think -- thanks Joe. The market is structurally different than it was in 2019 and before for a few reasons. I think the change in the junket environment and the shift to mass is well understood. On the OpEx side, the concessionaires were encouraged to and generally did maintain labor throughout the course of the shutdown. There are components of the labor pool where I think all of us were able to, particularly with respect to some foreign labor, where we were able to trim.And so I think I've heard comments from some of our competitors that they were bringing labor back on, particularly on the housekeeping side, et cetera, et cetera. I think that's generally true for us. We have been operating at full capacity since the day the market reopened. We're probably light in a couple of labor categories, not high-dollar labor categories. So I don't think we're in a situation where certainly our fixed costs are going to meaningfully accelerate as the market accelerates. And I would expect some pretty healthy operating leverage coming out of the business over the course of the next couple of years.If you look at where Palace printed this quarter, you can look at that relative to 2019, and you can see that there was distinct margin improvement. Our service levels certainly haven't degraded versus 2019. So I'm pretty bullish.Joseph Richard GreffGreat. And I was hoping you can maybe put a little bit more meat on the bones with respect to your comments about April and Macau in terms of an EBITDA run rate. I don't know if you want to look at it as a percentage growth rate in relation to March or for the full quarter, but any additional details would be appreciated.Craig Scott BillingsWell, I would just say our average EBITDA per day in April was up over our average EBITDA per day in Q1. You saw what the market did. The market grew quite healthy from both February to March and then March to April. And we had 14% share in the first quarter. So I think you can probably do the math from there.OperatorOur next caller is Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.Shaun Clisby KelleyJust was hoping we could get a little bit more color on the recovery you're seeing maybe in the VIP segment. So obviously, I think you called out direct being, I think, double over the Golden Week holiday. But maybe just in general, how you're serving that higher-end customer where you see them playing on the floor? Just kind of behaviorally, how has the market kind of adapted and adjusted to that and how your direct program has evolved as well?Craig Scott BillingsSure. I think it's -- Shaun, I think it's honestly a little bit too early to forecast the overall trajectory of VIP, both direct and junket. But certainly, we were pleased with turnover in both the quarter and subsequent to, including Golden Week. I think it's a testament to how much Macau in general and we, in particular, have to offer those customers, including those from broader Asia.So we're watching the situation closely. Stay tuned. I don't think there's been a lot of, frankly, changes in terms of how we execute in direct. We certainly have developed some incremental relationships, player referral relationships outside of the traditional markets, and that's part of the broader mandate to improve international visitation to Macau. But the way that we underwrite credit, the way we think about extending credit, none of that has changed. So we'll see how it develops over the course of the next couple of quarters. But overall, I think we've been pleasantly surprised.Shaun Clisby KelleyAnd as my follow-up, could you just -- going back to the renovations for a second on the Peninsula, your expectations for when those should conclude or if they don't conclude entirely sort of become materially less of a headwind from here, how long that program is expected to last?Craig Scott BillingsThe material impact will subside this quarter. So we had the portions of the main floor on the East side closed at various points throughout Q1. That's complete. Now we're doing some work in some of our adjacent salons, and that will complete this quarter. There's a number of other things that will have a longer tail, but it shouldn't impact revenue the same way.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next caller is Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.Daniel Brian PolitzerI wanted to actually pivot to Wynn on margin. Can you maybe talk about how we should think about this property evolving over time in terms of the timing of your capital commitment, maybe the financing breakdown versus the equity contributions versus debt, gaming versus nongaming? Just any additional color and I appreciate that the presentation was pretty thorough. But just as we think about this going forward and over the next few years, that would be helpful.Craig Scott BillingsYes. Sure. Think about it as a $4 billion project for now. Think about it as 50% equity, 50% construction-related financing with the exact percentage TBD. Think about the equity going in pro rata with the construction cost, that's always a debate you have with the financing sources. So we'll see how that goes, but that's the way that I would model it for now.I've talked a bit about this on prior calls. The market in Dubai from a nongaming perspective is incredibly healthy. If you look at ADRs, if you look at spend on food and beverage, if you look at spend on luxury retail, it's tremendous. And so we think that this -- the more time we spend there, we think that this business is much more akin to our Las Vegas business than it is, say, Macau or Boston, which are primarily gaming-centric markets. So we think that this will be a healthy balance of gaming-nongaming and that, that will allow us to provide a very full and high-quality experience and generate very healthy returns.Daniel Brian PolitzerGot it. And then just in terms of Macau, I know there was a couple of moving pieces in the quarter. Is there any way to maybe quantify -- and I recognize that this is not something you would typically adjust for, but that mass hold in the quarter in terms of the impact to EBITDA as well as that construction disruption and just as we kind of think about in a normalized scenario going forward, that would be helpful.Craig Scott BillingsYes. So there's probably 500 basis points of low mass hold, plus or minus. You have the statistics in the press release, you have drops, so you can apply that to it. And the construction disruption, we have not quantified.OperatorOur next caller is David Katz with Jefferies. We'll go to the next caller. Robin Farley, you may go ahead with UBS.Robin Margaret FarleyI just wanted to circle back to your comments about VIP hold, the fact that it was at kind of 2x the level of 2019 your direct business for Golden Week. If we think about your direct VIP business in 2019 being maybe kind of 15% of total VIP, is it reasonable to think you could get back to 30% of previous VIP levels or even higher since this is really just kind of out of the box here under the new regulations?Craig Scott BillingsWell, thanks, Robin. I think what's unknown at this point is the denominator in your equation. So we don't know what total VIP will be yet, right? We need to really see how that develops over the course of the next couple of quarters.There's really no legal or structural impediments to us returning to our prior direct VIP business or, frankly, exceeding it. It's unaffected by -- generally unaffected by the legal changes that happened. So I think that we were...Robin Margaret FarleyI mean that's what I was suggesting. In other words, if you were at 2x the level already for Golden Week that you could -- in other words, is there a reason that wouldn't be a sustainable rate of sort of recovery of your previous what was direct, that you'd be able to recapture some of what have been junket business at that same level or even higher?Craig Scott BillingsNo. There's no reason that we couldn't do that, other than credit underwriting. What we won't do is underwrite players that we're not comfortable with from an asset perspective. So with that caveat, no, there's nothing that could stop that.Julie Cameron-DoeWe'll take one last question, operator.OperatorJohn DeCree with CBRE.John G. DeCreeMaybe bring the conversation back home for one in Las Vegas, obviously, a fantastic quarter for you guys in the market as a whole. And 2 kind of customer segments that we're paying attention to is the international customer and convention recovery. Presumably, we've seen both of those kind of accelerate in 1Q. So curious to get your thoughts on where the recovery of those 2 segments are for Wynn specifically and how much room you see in front for those kind of 2 customer segments relative to '19.Craig Scott BillingsSure. I'll cover international and then I'll ask Brian to talk about the group and convention pacing. On the international side, you're right, the market has not gotten back to its full pre-COVID levels. It's really been a geography-by-geography question. LatAm started to return early. Europe has started to come back. And so there are certainly opportunities in international.I do want to -- I would specifically call out China and Mainland Chinese guests where we don't know yet because it's very, very early there. And so we'll see how that plays out. But international is starting to trickle back. And I think that, that will be a tailwind as we move through 2023 with the caveat that I mentioned with respect to seeing how China plays out.Brian, do you want to comment on our group and convention pace?Brian GullbrantsSure. Thanks, Craig. John, yes, I would say that group is back beyond '19 levels at this point. When you look to Q1 and what we did, the team did an amazing job. We had one of our best -- well, we had the best convention group revenue we've ever had. We had all the stars line up, CES, Homebuilders, CONEXPO. It was just a phenomenal quarter, which then helped drive the record quarter.If you look forward, I think the group business is solid. Our team has done a great job. We're pacing towards record group room nights for this year with very strong ADRs. We built a solid base that will allow us to yield manage our rooms in the other segments as we move forward. And right now, '24 -- knock on wood, '24 is actually pacing ahead of what we believe will be a record '23.So yes, we're back to beyond '19 levels, and we see this right now continuing. We're looking for the signs. Don't see any signs of softening yet, but we're going to be cautious and reactive, we have to. But right now, it looks pretty good.Craig Scott BillingsAnd we have -- again, as Brian said, it's proven to be interesting. I think everybody, at least that we talk to on the sell side and the buy side, keeps waiting for a shoe to drop in Vegas. And it hasn't to date.Now we have a 2023 playbook, 2024 playbook for every possible scenario because we learned how to operate our business incredibly efficiently as we went through all the various iterations of COVID. So we feel great about where we are. We're ready for anything, and we'll see how we go.John G. DeCreeThat's really helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, one more on Macau. Craig, could you kind of give us your insights on the competitive landscape, I guess, particularly on the direct VIP and premium mass? It seems like there's been plenty to go around so far in early recovery, but curious to get your updated thoughts on player reinvestment and how competitive or promotional the market has been, if at all?Craig Scott BillingsSure. It's early, right? And a wise person once told me that half of great strategic thinking is ignoring noise, and there is a tremendous amount of noise in the market in Q1. We had competitors with rooms out of commission. We had whole volatility because in the early portion of the quarter when you have lower volumes, you inherently have whole volatility. You have a lot of things. You have the market compounding month over month and growing month over month and creates a lot of noise.But in general, I would say that the market is coming back much more quickly than anybody would have thought of certainly 6, 9 months ago. It's incredibly good to see. The margin profile of the businesses across Macau looks pretty strong, which would indicate to me that reinvestment rates are relatively disciplined, which is good. And I think that overall, the behavior in the market is quite rational. So I think the next couple of months, the next quarter, 1.5 quarters, I think will be telling to see what the pace and size of the recovery is.If you -- I mean who can imagine that we're run rating $22 billion of GGR right now. For us, if you kind of roll the business forward and do your modeling, what you'll find is that at around $26.5 billion of GGR, our combined properties start to produce the EBITDA, something close to the EBITDA that they produced in 2019, which is pretty unbelievable.And so I think as you see the market continue to gain momentum, and we've all -- all of us in that market have been around the block many, many times, have been through ups, downs and everything else, I think you'll see the concessionaires behave relatively rationally. And I think it's good for the market. It's good for us. It's good for them.John G. DeCreeYes. That sounds very encouraging, Craig. Congratulations on a great quarter.Craig Scott BillingsThank you. Appreciate it.Julie Cameron-DoeThank you. Well, with that, we'll close the call. Thank you for your interest in Wynn Resorts, and we look forward to sharing more information with you next quarter.OperatorThank you for participating on today's conference call.

This compares to loss of $1.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 261.11%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this casino operator would post a loss of $1.17 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.23, delivering a surprise of -5.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Wynn , which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry, posted revenues of $1.42 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.50%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $953.33 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Wynn shares have added about 36.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.8%.What's Next for Wynn?While Wynn has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Wynn: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, adverse macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of income and consumer discretionary spending, changes in interest rates, inflation, a decline in general economic activity or recession in the U.S. and/or global economies, uncertainty surrounding the pace of recovery of tourism and travel in Asia following the COVID-19 pandemic, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions, dependence on key employees, general global political conditions, adverse tourism trends, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction risks, cybersecurity risk and our leverage and debt service. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.Non-GAAP Financial Measures(1) ""Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income (loss), Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.(2) ""Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited"" is net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and foreign currency remeasurement and other, net of noncontrolling interests. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures to financial measures in accordance with GAAP because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to net income (loss) and income (loss) per share computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income (loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDAR, and (iii) net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDAR.WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIESCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in thousands, except per share data)(unaudited)Three Months

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 69% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wynn Resorts. Check out our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wynn Resorts?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Wynn Resorts already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wynn Resorts' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Wynn Resorts. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 7.6% of the stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wynn ResortsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Wynn Resorts, Limited. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$1.9b stake in this US$13b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wynn Resorts. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

WDIV has been able to amass assets over $244.41 million, making it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, WDIV seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index.The S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index measures the performance of high dividend-yield companies included in the S&amp;P Global BMI that have followed a managed-dividends policy of increasing or stable dividends for at least ten consecutive years.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for WDIV, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.05%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, A2a S.p.a. (A2A-IT) accounts for about 1.58% of total assets, followed by New World Development Co. Ltd. (17-HK) and Lenovo Group Limited (992-HK).WDIV's top 10 holdings account for about 10.11% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, WDIV has gained about 2.68%, and is down about -0.90% in the last one year (as of 05/10/2023). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $51.92 and $67.16.The ETF has a beta of 0.80 and standard deviation of 15.47% for the trailing three-year period, making it a low risk choice in the space. With about 122 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $17.47 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $26.63 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Theoretically Yes, Factually No Says S&P",CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrencies-inflation-hedge-theoretically-yes-084656048.html,1683708416,STORY,"['GC=F', 'SPGI']","[Ratings agency S&amp;P Global on Tuesday took note of cryptocurrencies' appeal as assets that protect investors from the effects of inflation, while also stressing the lack of data to support the popular narrative.""Crypto assets could theoretically be a hedge against inflation,"" the New York-based agency said in a press release shared with CoinDesk, noting adoption in some emerging markets battling high inflation.""Some argue that crypto assets could be in demand in a high-interest rates/high inflation environment because they could serve as a store of value. We think the track record for crypto is too short to prove this,"" the New York-based agency added, drawing attention to bitcoin's (BTC) weak correlation with U.S. inflation expectations.Crypto propounders consider bitcoin, the world's largest digital asset by market value, as a store of value asset like gold, thanks to a programmed code that halves bitcoin's pace of supply expansion every four years.The so-called mining reward halving contradicts the ever-increased fiat money supply globally. (Propounders believe massive money printing by central banks is inflationary). The broader crypto market, including decentralized finance (DeFi), is considered an alternative to a centralized fiat banking system.However, past data suggest otherwise. The agency's findings show that historical correlation between the daily returns of S&amp;P BDMI (the agency's crypto index) and the U.S. two-year and 10-year breakeven inflation expectations is just 0.10. The correlation between the rolling three-month returns for S&amp;P BDMI and 10-year breakeven inflation expectations shows no conclusive pattern agency said.In other words, there is little association between the crypto market and inflation expectations. A strong correlation of at least 0.75 might be needed to validate the inflation hedge narrative.Breakeven inflation rates are measures of investors' expectations for inflation over a specific period derived by subtracting the yield on inflation-protected bonds from the yield on nominal bonds.Story continuesBitcoin's market value tanked by over 70% last year even though inflation in the U.S., as measured by the consumer price index, averaged 8%, per Statista.The rolling three month returns between the two shows no conclusive pattern. (Source: S&amp;P Global,l, Fred)The chart shows several periods where an increase in inflation expectations has failed to lift crypto market valuations. There have been periods when the two were simultaneously positive or negative.In contrast, the agency said that gold's daily returns have consistently tracked inflation expectations since 2013, adding, ""There is evidence of Granger Causality between the 10-year Breakeven Inflation Expectation index and the S&amp;P GSCI Gold index at a 95% confidence level.""The Granger Causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether time series X is helpful in forecasting Y.""The same test fails for Bitcoin,"" S&amp;P Global noted.At the same time, cryptocurrencies seem sensitive to cost of borrowing in the economy and tend to move in the opposite direction of the U.S. two-year Treasury yield, which is more susceptible to interest rate expectations than longer duration bond yields.The chart shows inverse relationship between the two. (S&amp;P Global, Fred)""On a daily rolling three-month basis, interest rates [two-year yield] and the crypto index have exhibited an inverse relationship 63% of the time since May 2017. This increases to 75% from May 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" S&amp;P Global said.]"

This new dataset will support companies, investors and entities as they seek to understand, manage and mitigate exposure of corporates and portfolios to nature related risks and impacts.New S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 mark (PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global Sustainable1)Nature &amp; Biodiversity Risk can be accessed through S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro and covers over 17,000 companies and over 1.6 million assets and provides a number of new nature-related risk metrics including a dependency score and ecosystem footprint measure enabling greater understanding of a company or asset's dependency and impact on nature. The dataset applies the Nature Risk Profile, a new methodology for analyzing companies' impacts and dependencies on nature, launched by S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in January this year.Thomas Yagel, Chief Operating and Product Officer, S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 said:""From the launch of the Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) in 2021 to the significant commitments made at COP15, there is an increasing demand from companies and investors to be able to quantify both their dependency on nature and the impact of their operations on location-specific ecosystems.""Story continuesThe dependency score* considers the level of reliance that a business' direct operations have on 21 different ecosystem services, as well as the expected resilience risk of the ecosystem providing these services, where these businesses are operating around the world. The dependency score is on a scale from 0 to 1.0 (where 0 represents no dependency risk and 1.0 represents very high dependency risk).The Ecosystem Footprint** measures a business' direct operational impact on nature and biodiversity. This metric combines three key areas of analysis: the areas of land impacted by the company (land area), the degree to which the location-specific ecosystem integrity is reduced (ecosystem degradation) and the significance of the location-specific ecosystem impacted (ecosystem significance).Steve Bullock, Global Head of Research and Methodology, S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 said:""Our research shows that 85% of the world's largest companies have a significant dependency on nature, indicating the critical importance of greater transparency for market participants on nature-related risks and opportunities. This new dataset signals a maturation of the conversation on nature and provides clear metrics quantifying the nature related dependency and impact of over 1.6 million global real assets.""Applying this new dataset to the S&amp;P 1200, the world's largest public companies, our analysis shows that:85% of the world's largest companies have a significant dependency* on nature across their direct operations.46% of the world's largest companies have at least one asset located in a Key Biodiversity Area (KBA)*** that could be exposed to future reputational and regulatory risks.S&amp;P 1200 companies used an estimated 22 million hectares of land for their direct operations in 2021 to generate USD 28.9 trillion revenue.The dataset can be leveraged by market participants to understand their nature-related risks and more transparent alignment with Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) recommendations. The dataset is aligned with the LEAP risk and opportunity assessment approach, as recommended by the TNFD.Dependency score methodology note:*The dependency score considers the level of reliance that a business has on 21 different ecosystem services, as well as the expected resilience risk of the ecosystem providing these services, where these businesses are operating around the world. Significant dependency is signified by companies that have a dependency score over 0.6 (where 0 represents no dependency risk and 1.0 represents very high dependency risk).Ecosystem footprint methodology note:** In order to provide a decision-useful metric that enables comparison between business operations, land area, ecosystem integrity degradation and ecosystem significance are brought together to calculate the equivalent impact on the most significant areas globally in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. This produces an Ecosystem Footprint expressed as the equivalent number of hectares in the most globally significant ecosystems that would be fully degraded by the company's operations.Key Biodiversity Area note:***KBAs are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN], 2016).

Corporate ""greedflation."" (Stefani Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images)Throughout all the debate in the last year over what has caused higher prices and how to remedy them, one term hasn't received the attention it deserves, given how well it explains the trend:""Greedflation.""The term defines as what happens when businesses raise prices higher and faster than is needed to cover increases in their costs. We've reported before that soaring corporate profits have contributed more to inflation than the Federal Reserve Board's preferred targets, wages and consumer demand. Two recent papers, however, measure their impact and identify some of the leading culprits by name.Until recently it was considered heretical to point to a possible relationship between the first signs of a profit explosion and sharp price increases.Weber and Wasner, University of MassachusettsResearchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City calculated that in 2021, when inflation reached an annualized rate of 5.8%, corporate markups grew by 3.4%. The upshot: Markups ""could account for more than half of 2021 inflation.""In other words, during a period in which consumer demand largely cratered because people were staying home, businesses jacked up prices so far and so fast that they more than compensated for the decline in overall sales.That's the finding of the second paper, by Isabella M. Weber and Evan Wasner of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They traced price increases at several companies and connected them with their executives' public indications that the pandemic, along with oil price shocks resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and supply logjams at American ports, gave them headroom to raise prices without a significant backlash from consumers.Once publicity about higher inflation percolated through news reports, consumers came to expect higher prices, which were blamed more on the headlined inflationary factors than on businesses' inclination to protect or even increase their profit margins.Story continues""Publicly reported supply chain bottlenecks and cost shocks,"" Weber and Wasner wrote, ""serve to create legitimacy for price hikes and create acceptance on the part of consumers to pay higher prices.""What Weber and Wasner labeled ""sellers' inflation"" has posed problems for the Fed's effort to bring inflation down that the central bank has never adequately confronted. The run-up in prices instituted by big corporations, the authors wrote, prompted workers to demand higher wages; amid a labor shortage, wages indeed rose — for a time.The Fed tried to combat the recent inflationary surge with tools that had been developed for more conventional inflationary cycles. In those cycles excess demand forced prices higher; therefore tamping down demand by raising interest rates has been a customary remedy. That's been the strategy of the Fed over the last year, during which it has raised rates by a full five percentage points.But that has only further victimized those harmed most by inflation: workers. ""Ultimately,"" write Weber and Wasner, ""hiking interest rates is meant to increase unemployment, which hurts workers who have already been in a defensive position in this inflation.""The Fed has tended to downplay the role of corporate profit-seeking in driving inflation. ""Until recently it was considered heretical to point to a possible relationship between the first signs of a profit explosion and sharp price increases,"" Weber and Wasner observe.Yet the extraordinary increase in corporate profits has unfolded in plain sight. Since the dawn of the 21st century, wages have gained 82%. Corporate profits have soared by nearly 600%. Corporate markups — that is, prices over costs — spiked much higher than historical averages. ""Between 1960 and 1980, markups averaged 26% above marginal costs,"" Joseph E. Stiglitz and Ira Regmi of the Roosevelt Institute noted in December. ""The average markup charged in 2021 was 72% above the marginal cost.""During the pandemic, corporate chief executives have been unabashed about disclosing their pricing strategies and tying them to the inflationary atmosphere.As PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told investment analysts in April 2021, ""the environment is well set up for pricing to be positive going forward.""At the giant food processing company Tyson Foods, executives were equally confident in May 2021 that consumers would stay docile. Responding to a Wall Street analyst's question about how the company would manage through a ""very inflationary"" environment, Chief Operating Officer Donnie King said that Tyson's customers ""certainly understand the inflationary need,"" adding, ""I think we will be quite successful in this endeavor"" — that is, responding to inflation with price hikes.Corporate markups have reached a record during the pandemic, helping to trigger inflation (Konczal and Lusiani, Roosevelt institute)Tyson, indeed, was able to fatten its profit margins through price increases that more than compensated for lower sales volumes during the pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2021, its sales of beef fell by 6.2% compared with the same period in 2020, but it raised prices by 31.7%, enabling it to widen its operating margin on beef to 19.1% from 13.2%.In the case of chicken, sales grew only 3.6% from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the same quarter a year later, but Tyson raised prices by 19.9% — turning a negative margin of 7.6% at the end of 2020 to a 3.6% profit a year later.Another company that bobbed atop the inflation wave through higher prices was Procter &amp; Gamble, which markets such familiar products as Pampers diapers, Bounty paper towels, Gillette razors, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and Crest toothpaste. In the fourth quarter of 2022, sales across all P&amp;G's product segments fell by 6% compared with a year earlier, but it raised prices by 10%, limiting its overall decline in profit margin to 1.6 percentage points.A year later, its pricing strategy bore even greater fruit: Sales volume had shrunk by 3% year to year, but thanks to another 10% average price increase, its profit margin widened by 1.5 percentage points to a healthy 48.2% of net sales.The chemical giant DuPont was candid about how the supply logjam and other shocks enhanced its ability to raise prices and make them stick.""It's a constructive market for pricing,"" Chairman and CEO Edward D. Breen said in February 2021. DuPont's chief financial officer, Lori Koch, referred to cost increases in raw materials in adding, ""there's ... a couple of recent force majeures in the industry that's making the price environment even more conducive.""Asked if a decline in raw material prices would prompt DuPont to roll back its prices, Breen said not to worry. ""If a recession hits, and commodity costs come down,"" he said, DuPont's intention would be ""maintaining more price than the decrease on the commodity.""Oil companies were especially adept at extracting profits from the volatile pandemic-era markets, largely because they've operated amid sharp run-ups and declines in oil prices for many decades.When demand all but disappeared in 2020 and world oil prices collapsed, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, among other oil companies, shut down their least profitable production facilities, as they had done in the past. But when demand began to recover in 2021 and oil prices spiked with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, they were slow to scale production back up.""We've created this hole with a lot more capacity coming off-line without a whole lot of new capacity ... coming on,"" Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said last July. ""So we've got this gap, ... which has led to a record, record-high refining margins."" Woods said that new refining capacity had been delayed by the pandemic and the poor economics of oil product in 2020 and early 2021, and would soon appear.Corporations' ability to put through price increases derives from more than consumer docility. Those with strong brands, a reputation for quality, and products seen as indispensable will typically find it easier to retain customers.That's the explanation offered by Procter &amp; Gamble CEO Andre Schulten to investors last July: ""Our categories being daily-use categories that consumers don't deselect even when they see high levels of inflation, our focus on Irresistible Superiority, our ability to make strong value claims based on that superiority ... positions us well to compete in the environment.""Another factor is a dearth of competition. ""Companies are not raising prices solely because of the increasing costs of supplies and components and of labor,"" former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich told a House committee on May 7, 2022. ""They're passing these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices ... because they can. And they can because they don't face meaningful competition.""Since the 1980s, Reich testified, ""two-thirds of all American industries have become more concentrated."" That allows them to raise prices ""without risking the possibility of losing customers, who have no other choice."" For businesses in this enviable position, publicity about inflation gives them cover to raise prices and funnel the gains into greater profits.Nor should anyone expect price reductions as costs come down. Corporate executives have generally signaled that they expect price increases they have already instituted to remain in place.If one properly acknowledges the contribution of corporate profit-seeking in inflation, two things become clear. One is that the Fed has grasped the wrong end of the stick in its battle against high prices. That may not be surprising, because monetary policy is the only tool the Fed possesses.Another is that corporations' price-setting powers are the result of policy choices by successive congresses and administrations. They've stood idly by as mergers and acquisitions reduce competition throughout the economy and have allowed companies in some industries to collect windfall profits without limitation.Stiglitz and Regmi see some glimmers of hope that decades of indulging big business may be reversing. Under Chair Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission has signaled a more aggressive stance against anticompetitive mergers. The Inflation Reduction Act enacted last year incorporated new incentives for production of renewable energy sources, which could counteract the market power of big oil companies. Providing child care and raising wages would bring more people into the labor force.But America is still big business' playing field. For even longer than the last year we have been paying the price.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The Madison plant is doing limited ""further processing"" work, she said, after hogs are slaughtered elsewhere.The company previously said it was repairing the plant and expected it to resume production the second week of May.Tyson's pork business lost $31 million in the quarter that ended on April 1, compared to a profit of $59 million a year earlier. Average sales prices for the company's pork tumbled by 10.3% in the quarter due to reduced global demand, while sales volumes edged up because more hogs were available for slaughtering, Tyson said in an earnings report on Monday.The meatpacker lowered its forecast for its pork unit's adjusted operating margins to a loss of 2% to breaking even for fiscal year 2023. In February, the company projected full-year margins would be 0% to 2%.On Tuesday, the amount of money meatpackers earn buying hogs and converting them into meat was about $5.05 per hog, compared to $7.70 per hog on Monday, analysts at HedgersEdge.com said.U.S. meatpackers slaughtered an estimated 451,000 hogs on Tuesday, down from 470,000 hogs a week ago and 478,000 hogs a year ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.(Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

The company's numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$132 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$108. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like QUALCOMM better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At QUALCOMM Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of QUALCOMM shares. In total, insiders dumped US$1.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. QUALCOMM insiders own about US$146m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At QUALCOMM Tell Us?Insiders sold QUALCOMM shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM that deserve your attention before buying any shares.But note: QUALCOMM may not be the best stock to buy.

We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, both PulteGroup and NVR are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PHM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.72, while NVR has a forward P/E of 14. We also note that PHM has a PEG ratio of 0.48. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

PHM, Novartis NVS, Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD, Cummins CMI and W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy for Safe ReturnsWall Street is caught in feeble trading triggered by an uncertain Fed policy, growing geopolitical tensions and recession fears. This has compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing. In fact, applying some smart-beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — PulteGroup Inc., Novartis, Boyd Gaming Corp., Cummins and W.W. Grainger Inc. — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesAs a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:Atlanta-based PulteGroup is engaged in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.34 over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 15.6% over the past four quarters.PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Switzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of oncology drugs and generics, which has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of nine cents over the past 30 days for this year, with estimated growth of 9.2%.At present, NVS has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B.Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company. It owns and operates gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The company saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 37 cents over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an earnings surprise of 13.69% over the past four quarters.Boyd Gaming has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Indiana-based Cummins is a leading global designer, manufacturer and distributor of diesel and natural gas engines, and powertrain-related component products. It has seen a solid earnings estimate revision of 70 cents for this year over the past month, and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 30%.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Illinois-based W.W. Grainger is a broad-line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products and services.

We assume no duty to update these statements.(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, David Fischel, Chairman and CEO of Stereotaxis.David Leo FischelThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Our last call 2 months ago included a fairly comprehensive overview of Stereotaxis and our strategy. We will keep today's call more brief, focusing on a few commercial and innovation updates.Revenue in the first quarter was essentially identical to last year's first quarter, barring the royalty payments that we no longer receive from Johnson &amp; Johnson. System revenue in the quarter reflects partial revenue recognition on the shipment of 1 Genesis system that is completing installation as we speak. During the first quarter and subsequent to our last earnings call, we received a purchase order for a Genesis system from a U.S. hospital. We received another Genesis system order from Europe so far this quarter.The combination of the partial system revenue recognition out of our backlog and additional order into our backlog slightly increased quarter end system backlog to just over $15 million. Hospital construction has remained relatively slow, weighing on the speed with which backlog converts into revenue and then into installed active robots. That said, we have a fairly busy schedule of installs planned over the coming months and continue to expect the majority of our backlog to be recognized as revenue this year. Since the launch of Genesis 3 years ago, we have now received orders for 22 robotic systems.Building a capital sales capability, process and infrastructure has taken time and required significant effort, but these 22 orders over 3 years is a dramatic turnaround from the period prior to Genesis when only 1 system was ordered over the same time frame. Of the 22 robots ordered since our launch, 9 have been installed and are doing procedures, 5 have been shipped to the hospital customer but are not yet installed or launched and 8 remain in backlog waiting to be shipped.Our orders have been broad-based geographically with just over 50% of orders from the United States and approximately 25% each from Europe and Asia. They are also evenly split between greenfield robots and upgrades with 11 of each. We are continuing to improve and refine our commercial capabilities and expect as we do so to see increasing orders of Genesis.Our capital pipeline looks healthy and has seen growth across our 3 focus regions. We have a few dozen, approximately 50 unique opportunities in our near-term pipeline where we see a possible order over the next 12 months. Order flow remains lumpy. The macro environment remains pressured, and we have still not fully benefited from a normalized replacement cycle. But given the engagement received from the bottom up, there's increasing confidence in a consistent flow of orders. Most important to the adoption of robotics is the enthusiastically positive experience of the physicians who are using Genesis along with the reliability and clinical value Genesis robots are demonstrating in the field. Engaged and happy customers who are able to provide great care to their patients and build successful practices are the best ambassadors through which to ultimately increase awareness, change historical misperceptions and grow adoption.We are pleased with the procedure utilization we are seeing on Genesis robots, which is meaningfully higher than our average global utilization. This is playing out both at accounts that upgraded to Genesis and with those that establish entirely new robotic practices.Last month, I had the opportunity to meet physicians from 2 of our most recent greenfield Genesis launches, Poland's National Institute of Cardiology and Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale. Where both, we have happy and excited users who are grateful for our technology and are using it to treat patients in ways that meaningfully improve the quality of care and access to care. Discussions like those reinforce the positive impact of our technology and the relevance and importance of robotics for the field.Our overall experience with Genesis serving as the spark to restart capital adoption and to support utilization is a reminder of the significant impact innovation has on commercial results.This segues well into a few concept and innovation. On our last call, we discussed in detail the key efforts in our strategic innovation plan and how they deliver meaningful clinical, commercial and strategic value. Apart from the minority of our users who have been able to upgrade to Genesis, most existing robotic electrophysiologists have remained limited to using essentially the same ecosystem of robot, catheter and mapping technology for over a decade. Stereotaxis' proprietary robotically navigated ablation catheter, MAGiC, is set to positively address it. Since our last call, we have made significant progress on both the EU and U.S. regulatory paths for MAGiC.In Europe, we have been awaiting receipt of the full spectrum of technical, clinical and microbiology questions from the EU regulator. We have now received questions across all 3 of those categories and have fully responded to all the questions in what we believe to be a comprehensive and thoughtful manner supportive of CE Mark. I would not be surprised -- it would not be surprising to receive follow-up questions to our responses, but we believe our previously communicated time line is reasonable and still see receipt of CE Mark as most likely to occur late in the second quarter or in the summertime.In the U.S., submission of an IDE application to the FDA has been dependent on successfully completing a dozen preclinical studies. As of our call 2 months ago, we had established a GLP-level institutional animal care and use program and run a few pilot cases but have not yet performed those on the record studies. We completed all the required studies since that call and will complete all the required follow-up periods within the next 2 weeks. The results we have seen and physician feedback we received is very supportive of our confidence that the catheter performs well and will be enthusiastically adopted by the community of robotic users. Given this progress, we expect to make an IDE submission to the FDA in the third quarter.Our other major innovation efforts, including a smaller self-shielding robot that frees us from the extensive planning and construction currently necessary to adopt robotics, a family of interventional guidewires and guide catheters that expand the benefits of our robot into new endovascular indications, a digital surgery, hardware and software offering, enabling broad operating in connectivity and a full electrophysiology product to ecosystem being built in collaboration with MicroPort.There is a significant amount of work in progress being made on each of these in parallel. As we provided much more color on each of these during our last call, I'll just reiterate that the time lines communicated on that call stand. We have line of sight to reach in multiple significant regulatory and commercial milestones this year with growing commercial impact from each of these technologies next year. As these technologies come to market, we will host focused innovation days to present these technologies in greater detail.While the optics of Stereotaxis' financial results are unexciting, we see ourselves as being on the cusp of strategic transformation. We have clear line of sight to a future with strategic independence, an attractive revenue model, drug robot accessibility and platform indication opportunity. This core product ecosystem serves as a foundation for a high-growth, high-value MedTech company pioneering endovascular robotics.Kim will now provide some commentary on our financial results, and then I will make a few financial comments as well before opening the call to Q&amp;A.Story continuesKimberly R. PeeryThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter of 2023 totaled $6.5 million, down from $7 million in the prior year first quarter, primarily due to discontinued royalty from Johnson &amp; Johnson. System revenue of $1.8 million reflects revenue recognition on the delivery of 1 Genesis system. Recurring revenue for the quarter of $4.7 million was predominantly impacted by the absence of the J&amp;J royalty, along with a smaller impact caused by J&amp;J catheter production shortages, which pressured procedure volume.Gross margin for the first quarter of 2023 was 59% of revenue. Recurring revenue gross margin of 79% remained similar with recent quarters with the loss of royalty impacting otherwise operational improvement. System gross margin of 7% continues to reflect significant allocation of overhead expenses over low manufacturing volumes. Operating expenses in the quarter of $9.5 million included $2.6 million in noncash stock compensation expense. Excluding stock compensation expense, adjusted operating expenses were $6.9 million compared to the prior year adjusted operating expenses of $6.5 million, reflecting increased spending in R&amp;D. Operating loss and net loss in the first quarter were $5.6 million and $5.3 million compared to $4.1 million for both in the previous year.Adjusted operating loss and net loss for the first quarter, excluding noncash stock compensation expense, were $3 million and $2.7 million. Negative free cash flow for the first quarter was $3.2 million. At March 31, we had cash and investments of $26.8 million.I will now hand the call back to David.David Leo FischelThank you, Kim. As detailed in today's press release, we are reiterating our expectation of double-digit revenue growth for the year given our existing system backlog and the view we have into our near-term system pipeline and installation schedule. System orders are also expected to increase in 2023 compared to 2022.Genesis system revenue remains the primary driver of overall revenue growth until we start to see more meaningful commercial contribution from our innovation strategy in 2024. Our core recurring revenue business remains relatively sticky and stable, and we expect will be boosted significantly as we bring the MAGiC catheter and vascular interventional devices to market. That said, procedures and disposable revenue in the first quarter were slightly pressured by catheter shortages J&amp;J experienced due to supply chain and production challenges. These challenges have continued into April, but we are told by J&amp;J that they will be addressed by the end of the quarter. We expect some impact from this likely in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars during the second quarter. Situations like these further reinforce the strategic, operational and financial value of the MAGiC catheter and having control over our own destiny.As we advance our innovation strategy to market, we maintain a balanced financial posture. We are investing in the organizational infrastructure and capabilities that will allow us to drive significant revenue growth from those innovations. At the same time, we remain financially prudent to ensure that our existing balance sheet can comfortably fund all our innovation efforts and commercial launches without the need for additional financing.We look forward to now taking your questions. Operator, can you please open line to Q&amp;A?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Joshua Jennings with TD Cowen.Joshua Thomas JenningsI wanted to ask about just the replacement cycle channel. And are you seeing any cracks in terms of that opening up? And what do you think needs to happen for that replacement cycle opportunity to start to kick in more fully?David Leo FischelSure. So it's been interesting because when we started it with the launch of Genesis around 3 years ago, we were always talking about the typical traditional 10-year cycle by which capital equipment gets replaced and by capital equipment, I mean mainly X-rays and cath labs. And clearly, that has been extended over the last few years, where we now have multiple systems that are even 14, 15 years old out there in the field. And I think in the past, I've mentioned that it's unclear how much of that extension of the life of X-rays is due to cyclical nature, just the macroeconomic environment and the financial pressures that hospitals have been under versus a secular change due to perhaps the reduced use of X-ray overall and to the longer life that they can exist before needing to be replaced. Probably, the truth is a mix of both. Either way, we have not seen that a contraction in that age where people are now starting to replace X-rays earlier. So it seems like the average age of an X-ray is definitely extending in most settings beyond 10 years. And we are starting to see as some of these sites become very old, we are starting to see, obviously, much more of a contribution from the replacement cycle of the 2 orders that we just mentioned. One was a replacement order, one was a greenfield order. But I would expect still that in our normalized level, we should probably be receiving high single-digit number of replacement systems a year. We've still not got into that point. We're still probably in the mid-single digits. So we probably still have a little bit of room to go to get to a more normalized level.Joshua Thomas JenningsUnderstood. I wanted to ask a question about potential just your drive for an open ecosystem within the EP world? And are there any potential advancements with, say, [INHABIT] to integrate your robotic magnetic navigation technology into the EnSite X mapping platform or any other mapping system integrations that we should have on our radar for this year?David Leo FischelSure. So we won't -- obviously, we can't comment on any type of collaborative activities that we would be doing prior to them being announced. I'd say that we've talked obviously about the importance of open ecosystems more generally for progress of the medical field and for patient care and for traditional choice, and then more specifically also for Stereotaxis and being able to pair the benefits of robotics broadly with a range of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. And so that concept of an open EP ecosystem is an important one. I think we've made quite a lot of progress on it over the last few years, and there's obviously more progress to be made. And so I'd say stay tuned, and we look forward to sharing updates as we're able to.Joshua Thomas JenningsGreat. And just last question, sorry to sneak one more in, but this full-scale ablation race in terms of getting a commercial cat in United States is on, the major cardiac ablation catheter players kind of teed up to get approvals over the coming 12, 18, 24-plus months. I guess how would you have investors think about the role that robotic navigation system like Genesis or mobile could play and could potentially enhance one of these larger players platforms and help them win this race, this PFA race.David Leo FischelSure. So we obviously see what's going on in the field and overall view kind of what how PFA is evolving into the field. And in many ways, kind of we view actually robotics as particularly well suited to be paired with PFA. We've had some experience that we've discussed in the past some of the preclinical studies that we've done with different PFA generators and some of the ongoing work that we are doing there. And given the constant and consistent contact that a robotically navigated catheter has with the heart tissue, there are actually a particular mechanistic benefits to pairing a robot with PFA. And we've done the preclinical work and like I've mentioned, and we're trying to kind of advance things in a way where we can reach a first in-man study and provide kind of more clarity on clinical commercial time line. And I'd say kind of overall, I would look though when I step back and think about PFA and how it's entering the EP field, when you look at kind of all the cardiac ablation procedures more generally and really kind of PFA is right now being targeted at paroxysmal AF and there's some thoughts in called persistent AF. And we have asked -- we have a majority of our procedures and kind of in the ventricle and certain SVT style procedures, where probably it will take still 5 to 10 years to know the role of PFA in those settings and there certain procedures where PFA will likely never be particularly applicable or beneficial or safe given kind of the type of arrhythmias that you would be dealing with and certain focal arrhythmias. And even in AF, as you have probably noticed the original view of PFA being a panacea has evolved into a more nuanced understanding of its role and it's partial role in the field. And so I think, again, we might not be the first mover in the PFA space, but I think we're doing all the right things on kind of the backside to make sure that we have a nice offering there. And that's where, again, this open EP ecosystem does provide a lot of value in allowing us to pair the benefits of robotics with a range of other technologies that are being developed.OperatorNext, we'll go to Frank Takkinen with Lake Street.Frank James TakkinenI wanted to start with one on the construction time lines. You briefly commented on it in the prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could take us a little bit deeper into how the construction time lines have been trending year-to-date and if there's any sign of those starting to be a little bit more predictable as we look at the back half of 2023?David Leo FischelFrank, so when I look now at kind of our, I guess, history of these 22 orders received since we launched Genesis, it seems kind of almost kind of a -- there's a lot of variability around these averages, but almost kind of 1 year from an order to roughly until most sites get kind of revenue recognized and installed in around 2 years until they go -- revenue recognized that they get shipped and then kind of around 2 years until they get kind of installed and are starting to do procedures. There's obviously a wide variability around that. We've had orders that get shipped and installed and starting doing procedures within 6 to 9 months. And we've had things where it takes 2 years and you still don't recognize revenue by shipping the system. And so there's kind of a wide band around that, but that seems to be kind of what the average has ended up being.We are seeing more -- definitely more scheduled installations over the next, let's say, 9 months or the remainder of this year and with a fairly busy schedule of things, i.e. some of those are things that have been backed up for long periods of time and other of those are from fairly recent orders where the sites seem to be on track for meeting the time lines that they want to have for installation. We still see many anecdotes, in many cases of hospitals that have a plan and that plan gets significantly delayed due to whatever construction issues or permitting issues they have. And I still am very much looking forward to the day where we do not have the complexity and the pain of the architectural and construction time lines. But at least we're seeing some movement kind of seemingly that is real revenue growth for the next several months.Frank James TakkinenOkay. That's helpful. And then for my second one, maybe speak to some of the usage patterns you've noticed from the new Genesis installs over the last couple of years. And what I'm hoping you can touch on is maybe where are these physicians typically starting to use the technology with patient pool? And what's their usage patterns look like at different milestones, say, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how the new Genesis users are ramping and how their usage is expanding within their patient populations.David Leo FischelSure. So -- so I don't have all the data in fronted me to answer you kind of in a comprehensive way with 3 months, 6 months, 12 months better. But I'll kind of -- let me think and kind of provide kind of a rough answer for that. And obviously, kind of across our installed base, Stereotaxis is overrepresented in the more complex ablations. That's where the mechanistic benefits of our robots are particularly pronounced. And so about half of our volume is in ventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, congenital patients and those types of patients. And that's also a patient population which is generally underserved, undertreated. Many of them don't have an option for good therapy without the use of our robot. And so that's where we provide particular clinical value. That said, there is benefits, obviously, across the spectrum of operation procedures. And so there are even procedures that might be considered typically as simple procedures where we are being used because of the safety profile and the precision of robotics and the clinical benefits that provides. And so there is kind of a full spectrum.When I think about kind of our Genesis installed base, I generally would say that the types of procedures they perform follows that spectrum of our overall installed base. And so we definitely have a pronounced use in the complex cases and that is oftentimes the motivating driver for why, let's say, a greenfield account would adopt a robot. But we do see usage across the spectrum of procedures, not just in the most complex ones, at least across many of the sites. Now there are certain sites which might limit us only to the most more complex cases, but we definitely do see across the installed base across the Genesis installed base and across greenfield genesis installs also usage kind of across the spectrum. And does that kind of partially answer you?Frank James TakkinenYes. No, that's perfect.OperatorNext, we'll go to Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.Alexander David NowakMaybe just expand on the J&amp;J royalty going away. Just remind us the dynamics around that. And if the royalty didn't go away, what have -- what were going to be the consumables sales in this quarter, just so we can figure out sort of same-store volume trends.David Leo FischelSure. So we've had obviously a very long-term relationship with Johnson &amp; Johnson. And several years ago, that relationship was turned from an exclusive relationship into a nonexclusive relationship. And then there was the time frame would remain a nonexclusive relationship and then where there would be a tail supply period where still for several years, J&amp;J would have to continue supplying catheters to the market. And that transition from the nonexclusive relationship to the tail supply period has started at the beginning of this year and J&amp;J stopped paying us royalties at that time. We missed out on something like about $0.5 million in the quarter due to the lack of the royalties.Alexander David NowakOkay. That's helpful. And then how long does that tail supply agreement last till?David Leo FischelA 3-year period?Alexander David NowakIt's 3 years. And then after the 3 years, there's basically no assumption that they will continue to supply catheters. Is that right? That will be the time frame we need to have MAGiC by?David Leo FischelThere is no legal requirement, contractual requirement. And I think it's still open to interpretation of how things will play out there, but -- and open to kind of see how things will play out. But if we do our job well, there shouldn't be any reason for them to continue supply.Alexander David NowakOkay. Understood. And then any discussion with the FDA around the Gen 3 self-shielded robot? Just what needs to be done internally before submitting the 510(k)? And then what could influence the time lines? What could pull it forward? What could drag it down?David Leo FischelSo we have made an initial -- we've informed FDA that this is kind of coming. So there's some awareness there, though we've not kind of submitted any documentation in a material way. And there is a lot of very recent experience with FDA on a robotic magnetic navigation system. We received Genesis FDA approval just 3 years ago. And so we went -- and that was a fairly extensive process for those of you that were on the call at the time -- you may remember, we had some catch-up 510(k) that had to be done. So there were multiple steps in the process of that approval, and given the long period that Stereotaxis had not been in regular dialogue with FDA. And since that time, we have been in relative dialogue, I think kind of we keep them up to date on our progress. And so overall, I think we have a fairly clear understanding of the requirements for a submission, obviously, regulatory and expectations evolve also over time. So let's say we're aware of the fact that there's generally more of a focus on things like human factors testing and on cybersecurity. And so we know that those are things that perhaps we want to do to at least document in a more extensive fashion versus previously. But overall, I think we feel very comfortable about the regulatory path and what needs to be done on our side, and we have the very recent experience, which guides our path.OperatorNext, we'll go to Neil Chatterji with B. Riley.Neil ChatterjiMaybe just on the sales funnel. Just curious how things are shaping up with the current capital spending environment and kind of ongoing hospital headwinds. It sounded like you still kind of see a pipeline of about 50. So just kind of curious to get an update there.David Leo FischelYes. So when we look at kind of the pipeline, I've kind of mentioned in the past that we have a more organized way to now review the pipeline and start it in each region. And there's approximately 2 dozen -- a little over 2 dozen in the U.S., about a dozen in Europe and about a dozen in Asia that have kind of accumulated on this pipeline where the sites are talking about potentially getting in order over the next year. And what I've seen generally is that there's obviously a subset of those that will get delayed, but kind of that's how our pipeline looks at this point. And I kind of -- sorry pair, I guess, this bottom up relative kind of a healthy growing pipeline, I think as our team matures as kind of their efforts in the field mature as the general marketplace, I think, sees our overall progress as a company, that helps. And so I see that kind of bottom-up pipeline as it's growing. I care that with kind of the top-down assessment that it still remains a relatively pressured environment. It's -- the macro environment is not -- is what I've called in the past that's still a headwind environment, not a tailwind environment. But I think with the balance of those 2, we're able to do kind of some progress, obviously, and we feel confident in the guidance that we've given this year. And so I guess kind of that's the balanced view point that given the spot and top-down data.Neil ChatterjiGot it. And then just maybe on China and MicroPort, the ecosystem there that's being developed, didn't sound like any huge updates there versus last quarter or last call. Just curious how things are tracking there. You obviously have Genesis submitted for approval and the broader platform being developed. So just curious on an update.David Leo FischelSure. So see, MicroPort submitted Genesis at the end of last year. And over the last couple of months has been submitting some supplemental information to the regulator there to that NDA. And they were -- and has been also working on its submission for the catheter, and it has to wait until we get CE Mark for MAGiC before it can submit MAGiC given the pathway that we want to go through, but it's also working on the submission for its own variant of a magnetically driven ablation catheter. And from a mapping interrogation perspective, we've already done very well. And so that's something that won't be a long pull in the tent at all. And so as we look at kind of all of that and what MicroPort feels is a reasonable time line, given its discussions with NMPA, we're still kind of comfortable in this first half of next year, that full ecosystem coming together. There might be certain approval that can come earlier. But I'd say that kind of that feels like the right time line overall. And really, it is that ecosystem of robot catheter mapping that should come together well in order to allow for the full launch and taking advantage of the full commercial team.Neil ChatterjiGot it. And maybe just one last quick one. I don't know if I missed it, but just any update on how you're tracking for the mobile RMN clearance in Europe in the second half?David Leo FischelYes. So we talked about kind of in the third quarter, and so I think we are working feverishly on multiple fronts there to be ready for kind of an approval at that point in the third quarter.OperatorNext, we'll go to Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.Adam Carl MaederDavid, Kim, 2 from me. The first one is on the MAGiC RF catheter. And I think I heard time lines for Europe still stand late Q2 or summer. Can you talk just a little bit about kind of commercial strategy there in terms of the launch? How aggressively will you be rolling MAGiC out to customers where you look to bolster or add sales reps prior to launching that? Just maybe flesh out the commercial strategy a little bit. And then I have a follow-up.David Leo FischelSo yes, so the time line, obviously, it still remains somewhat of a black box. You respond to questions and you kind of sit and wait, but everything is now kind of back on their court. We are very pleased that we got at least the first set of questions from them across all 3 categories, and we were able to respond in a timely fashion. And when we look at kind of the commercial -- and so assuming we get approval at some point this summer. And the overall commercial strategy is -- we have invested somewhat in our team in Europe. And so we have kind of 2 people more than what we have had historically, and that was done in anticipation of kind of MAGiC coming to market and opportunity that would present itself. And we are -- we have kind of done fairly detailed reviews of every one of our 30 some hospitals in Europe that have a robot. And in each one, understanding both the logistics of bringing the catheter to market, is there a tender, is there not? What hospital application needs to be filled in just on the logistics side? On the financial side, what should pricing look like on the kind of clinical side, what are the motivations of the physicians and what do they think about the catheter, what would be the drivers of adoption, the risks to adoption? And so I think we have a fair -- we have a good clarity. The team there has worked kind of now for a fairly long time. They've had to work on these business plans and we have a fairly good plan site-by-site what we want to do.We have designated a few sites, a handful of sites as those that will participate in a limited market release phase. While the catheter has kind of shown itself to be robust and working well across kind of the many studies now, and we -- there is a type of also art to cardiac ablation procedures. And so you do want good physicians who are interested in being the pioneers, who are interested in doing the early procedures to have a first shot at things to learn some of the tips and tricks that can only really be learned in that setting and then to be available to share their experience and help also train others. And so I would think about an LMR period of probably kind of several weeks, a few number of months, a couple of months, perhaps. And we're really focused on those sites and making sure that they use the catheter across the range of cases and can kind of document and refine best practices at which point then we would move into a full launch across all the 30 accounts in Europe. And so I think about it as a relatively -- with that kind of limited market release period post that being a relatively quick adoption across our installed base. I've talked in the past that there are certain countries in Europe where you do have tenders or other kind of administrative hurdles which don't allow you to fully kind of convert an account and just based off of commercial agreement and just based on kind of the physician's desire. So there are some of those places that countries like France, some of the Scandinavian ones where you do have kind of other logistical barriers, which will just take kind of over the course of probably a year or so, you can overcome the vast majority of those. But there are some of those that will slow adoption at certain accounts as we work through them.Adam Carl MaederOkay. Great. Very helpful color, David. And for the follow-up, just wanted to ask about HRS, which is scheduled for later this month. And I saw in the press release something about the potential to share meaningful updates on the innovation strategy at that conference. I was hoping you could just expand on that a little bit. What do you have planned either from a clinician standpoint or Wall Street perspective? Just any more details on HRS would be great.David Leo FischelThanks, Adam. Stay tuned. We, at this point, won't share much more, but -- but as kind of it's appropriate and as we're able to share more, we look forward to sharing some news at HRS that we think will be impactful for the EP community and also impactful, obviously, for the company and for the investor base. And so we look forward to sharing it there. And more generally, at HRS, and we're excited for our showing there. And there is a special session -- a joint session of the Society for Cardiac Robotic Navigation and HRS at the conference. And so that will be a nice session in which robotics is obviously kind of front and center. And again, apologies, I can't share much more at this point, but we look forward to sharing news in less than 2 weeks.Adam Carl MaederOkay. Perfect. We'll stay tuned there.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to David Fischel, Chairman and CEO of Stereotaxis for any additional or closing remarks.David Leo FischelOkay. Thank you very much for all your questions.

However, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.1% and 84.6%, respectively, seem impressive. Combining the actual results with the estimates for the still-to-report companies, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 19.2% on revenue growth of 3.5% (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Many industry bigwigs reported solid results, with some beating on earnings or revenues or both. As such, pharma ETFs have been in the green over the past month. VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, SPDR S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals ETF XPH and First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH have gained 2.4%, 3.5%, 1.1%, 4% and 2.1%, respectively, in a month.Let’s delve deeper into the earnings of some of the bigwigs:Earnings in FocusJohnson and JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson JNJ continued with its long streak of earnings beat and topped revenue estimates.

Revenues declined 11% year over year to $6.96 billion and beat the estimate of $6.81 billion. Eli Lilly raised its revenue guidance from $30.3-$30.8 billion to $31.2-$31.7 billion in 2023 and earnings per share guidance to a record $8.65-$8.85 from $8.35-$8.55.Story continuesETF AngleVanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (PPH)VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF follows the MVIS US Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index and holds 25 stocks in its basket.

QuoteSales of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 test kits in the first quarter were $201 million, compared with $488 million in the prior-year period. Excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, first-quarter internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.3% year over year.In the quarter under review, the company recorded sales of $2.26 billion in the North American market, down 6.2% year over year. Sales totaled $799 million in the international market, up 4% year over year.Segmental AnalysisHenry Schein derives revenues from three operating segments — Dental, Medical and Technology and Value-added Services.In the first quarter, the company recorded $1.9 billion in global Dental sales, up 3.8% year over year. The segment’s revenues included an internally generated sales increase of 4% in local currencies and 2.3% growth from acquisitions. The business registered a 2.5% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Global Medical revenues declined 17.2% year over year to $1 billion. The segment’s revenues included an internally generated sales decline of 17.1% in local currencies and a 0.1% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Revenues from global Technology and Value-added Services rose 6.8% to $191 million. The figure included 6.5% internal sales growth in local currencies, 1.5% growth from acquisitions and a 1.2% decline related to foreign currency exchange.Story continuesMargin TrendIn the reported quarter, the gross profit totaled $966 million, reflecting a 0.7% decrease year over year. However, the gross margin expanded 96 basis points (bps) to 31.6%.SG&amp;A expenses rose 5.1% to $717 million in the quarter under review.The adjusted operating profit in the first quarter was $249 million, reflecting a fall of 14.4% year over year. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin contracted 102 bps year over year to 8.1%.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $126 million, compared with $117 million at the end of 2022. The long-term debt of the company at the end of the first quarter was $1.02 billion compared with $1.04 billion at the end of 2022.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $27 million compared with $93 million in the year-ago period.In the first quarter of 2023, HSIC repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares of its common stock for $100 million. The company had approximately $415 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases by the end of the reported quarter.2023 GuidanceHenry Schein updated its guidance for 2023. The outlook considers the current continuing operations and completed acquisitions, including the recently closed Biotech Dental buyout.For 2023, the company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.18-$5.35 (from the previously-projected range of $5.25-$5.42), excluding the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. This implies growth of (4%) to (1%) compared with the earlier projected growth of (2%) to 1% from the 2022 reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is currently pegged at $5.32.For 2023, Henry Schein expects sales growth of nearly 1%-3% compared to the 2022 figure (unchanged from the previous guidance). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $12.84 billion.Our TakeHenry Schein ended the first quarter of 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, results reflected good earnings momentum in the company’s core businesses.HSIC’s Technology and Value-added Services business witnessed strong growth in North America, led by customers’ upgradation from the Easy Dental product to cloud-based solutions — Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend. Within the Dental segment, patient traffic remained stable, with robust sales of traditional dental equipment. The company is also progressing well in its BOLD +1 Strategic Plan, instilling investors’ optimism.Meanwhile, lower sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, acquisition-related expenses and foreign exchange headwinds continued to affect the top line. Mounting operating expenses resulting in the contraction of HSIC’s adjusted operating margin are worrisome.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksHenry Schein currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Yet, the increasing cost of production continues to hamper the company’s margin performance. Weak hospital spending trends and tough competition also pose threats. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Omnicell ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues, driven by strong execution, disciplined cost management and revenue timing. Reported revenues exceeded the high end of Omnicell’s previous revenue outlook in the band of $273-$283 million, which is highly appreciated. The year-over-year increase in Omnicell’s service revenues emphasizes its digital transformation strategy.The company’s adjusted EPS in the quarter surpassed the top end of the previous guidance in the band of 4-14 cents for the first quarter, led by a capable product and service mix, expense timing and solid execution. Omnicell, Inc. PriceOmnicell, Inc. PriceOmnicell, Inc. price | Omnicell, Inc. QuoteOmnicell remains well-positioned to meet pharmacy and hospital needs, backed by recent acquisitions and expansion of its advanced services solutions. Strong revenue contributions from the recent acquisitions of FDS Amplicare, ReCept and MarkeTouch Media are major tailwinds. The company’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service continues to witness increasing demand from health systems, which buoys optimism. The company’s long-term sole source agreements with more than 50% of the top 300 U.S. health systems will allow it to help customers mitigate ongoing labor challenges.In terms of its 2025 financial roadmap, Omnicell targets reaching 1.9 billion to 2 billion of revenues by 2025 at a 14% to 15% compounded total annual revenue growth rate from 2021 to 2025. Over the same period of time, it is also targeting an expansion of non-GAAP EBITDA margin from 21% in 2021 to 25% by 2025, representing margin expansion of approximately 400 basis points. The company is well-positioned to deliver on the 2025 total revenue growth targets, driven by factors like growing its tech services revenues, benefits from long-term sole source customer partnerships, multi-year co-development plans and increased average deal sizes.Story continuesOn the flip side, revenues in the first quarter were down 8.8% year over year. The decline was mainly due to lower point-of-care revenues as a result of ongoing health systems and capital budget constraints. We note that the economic environment, including its effect on Omnicell health system customers, has caused many health systems to implement capital budget freezes and additional budget approval processes, resulting in elongated sales cycles. At the same time, ongoing health system labor constraints continue to increase, resulting in a higher-than-typical number of customers requesting to temporarily defer point-of-care implementations.On a segmental basis, product revenues declined 17.8% year over year in the reported quarter. Meanwhile, rise in operating costs led to an operating loss in the quarter, placing significant pressure on the bottom line. The company has taken several measures to refine its cost structure, including a reduction in workforce and other expense containment efforts.Over the past year, Omnicell’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has declined 42.6% compared with the industry’s 33.3% plunge.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Solid first-quarter 2023 performance buoys optimism. However, forex woes and lower sales impede growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 3.8% against 25% decline of the industry and a 3.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $192.9 billion. The company projects a 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.28%.Let’s delve deeper.Q1 Upsides: Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter. The upside can be attributed to strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD successfully continued with its double-digit sales growth momentum for the last two years.Core Diagnostics Grow Strong: Excluding COVID-testing sales, organic sales growth was led by mid to high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the United States and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year. However, China is showing improved market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased nearly 8% globally in the first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbott successfully continued with the rollout of Alinity, the company’s innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across its platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testingStory continuesUpbeat Guidance: Abbott expects full-year adjusted earnings (excluding specified items of $1.25 per share) to be in the range of $4.30-$4.50. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36.Abbott projects 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, of at least high-single digits and COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies have been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Lower Sales: Abbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were affected by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. Within Diagnostics, as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decline in COVID testing sales compared with first quarter of 2022.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has been constant at $4.38.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting a 9.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World.The immunotherapy industry is a rapidly growing field that is focused on developing treatments that harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer and other diseases. Many companies are involved in the immunotherapy industry, ranging from large pharmaceutical companies to small biotechnology startups. These companies are working to create a range of different immunotherapy treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. According to Markets and Markets, the revenue of the global immunotherapy drugs market was estimated to be $163.0 billion in 2020. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0% from 2020 to 2025, reaching a value of $274.6 billion by 2025. The global immunotherapy drugs market is classified based on therapeutic areas into cancer, autoimmune &amp; inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, and other therapeutic areas. Among these, cancer held the largest share of the global immunotherapy drugs market in 2019. The dominance of this segment is attributable to the high incidence of cancer, increasing research efforts in this field, and the provision of reimbursement coverage for oncology immunotherapies.The size of the global cancer immunotherapy industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% from $85.6 billion in 2020 to $309.67 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. The National Cancer Institute reported that in 2020, around 1,806,590 new cancer cases were reported in the United States, and 606,520 people died from the disease. Researchers believe that this rise in cancer incidence is expected to drive the growth of the immunotherapy industry in the coming years. In 2020, North America contributed the highest revenue to the cancer immunotherapy market due to increased expenditure on healthcare, a focus on maintaining a top healthcare system, and a rising incidence of cancer worldwide. Asia-Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to exhibit the highest CAGR during 2021-2030, primarily due to a surge in per capita income and an improvement in healthcare infrastructure.Story continuesSome of the key players in the immunotherapy industry include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Roche Holdings AG (ROG.SW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). These companies are investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) to bring new immunotherapy treatments to the market. The industry has witnessed significant progress in recent years in developing effective immunotherapies for various diseases. However, there are also challenges in the development of these treatments, including managing potential side effects and ensuring that they are accessible and affordable to patients worldwide.15 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the WorldPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 15 biggest immunotherapy companies in the world, we compiled a comprehensive list of companies that have a significant presence in the immunotherapy industry. This involved considering their involvement in immunotherapy research and development as well as their successful commercialization of immunotherapy products. Various factors such as product pipeline strength, market share, research and development efforts, product innovation, and global reach were considered to evaluate the commercial success of these companies. The companies have been ranked in ascending order based on their market capitalization as of April 28. We have also included the number of hedge fund holders for each of these companies as of Q4 2022.Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World15. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Market Capitalization: $40.81 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that is working on developing innovative therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. One of Biogen Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) integral immunotherapy programs is formulating therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. The company’s flagship MS therapy is called Tysabri, which is a monoclonal antibody that targets a molecule called α4-integrin. Tysabri works by preventing immune cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier, which can help lessen inflammation and damage to the nervous system. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is also exploring other immunotherapy approaches for MS, including the creation of therapies that target B cells and other immune cells that are involved in the disease.ClearBridge Investments shared its outlook on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) was the leading contributor among several biopharma names, boosted by positive, pivotal clinical data for its next-generation Alzheimer’s treatment Lecanemab. In a pivotal trial, the drug proved safe and efficacious in slowing progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”14. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Market Capitalization: $52.03 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company involved in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines. One of Moderna’s immunotherapy programs is focused on developing personalized cancer vaccines. These vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells based on the patient’s unique genetic profile. Moderna, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) personalized cancer vaccines are based on a combination of mRNA technology and machine learning algorithms, which are used to identify the specific mutations in a patient’s tumour that are most likely to provoke an immune response. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) has already made significant progress in creating mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19, with its mRNA-1273 vaccine gaining mainstream recognition globally.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) became a household name during the pandemic as one of the first developers of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the stock sold off sharply as COVID momentum, including high expectations for booster shots, began to wear off, causing investors to slash its fiscal 2023 earnings estimates by two-thirds over the last year. We believe those downward revisions clouded the prospects for the company’s fully funded pipeline of platform opportunities, including cancer, RSV and flu. The cash-rich company also recently expanded its partnership with Merck to improve cancer treatments.”13. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK)Market Capitalization: $52.65 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK) is a Tokyo, Japan-based pharmaceutical company developing state-of-the-art therapies for a range of different diseases, including oncology. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK) is investing heavily in the development of CAR-T cell therapies, a type of immunotherapy that involves genetically modifying a patient’s T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. Takeda’s main immunotherapy program is focused on advancing CAR-T cell therapies for various types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma and solid tumours. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.92% as of April 28.12. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)Market Capitalization: $86.32 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is a Tarrytown, New York, biotechnology company that is dedicated to formulating advanced therapies for a range of different diseases, including oncology and autoimmune diseases. One of Regeneron’s crucial immunotherapy programs is concentrated on the advancement of monoclonal antibodies for cancer. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that can be designed to target specific molecules in cancer cells, which can help to stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer cells. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is working on creating a range of monoclonal antibodies for different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.Here’s what Bronte Capital said about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Market Capitalization: $107.05 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company. In a research note issued on February 14, Salim Syed at Mizuho increased the target for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock from $88 to $101 and maintained a Buy rating. The target price reflects a potential upside of over 20.8% from the closing price as of April 28. The analyst increased the target price to incorporate the increase in the company’s estimated peak sales from $19 billion to $20 billion for the HIV business. Meanwhile, the company’s autoimmune disease program is working on making therapies that can help to modulate the immune system and diminish inflammation, with a keen interest in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.Here’s what Ariel Investments said about Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”10. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Market Capitalization: $131.13 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a Thousand Oaks, California-based biotechnology company. One of Amgen’s notable immunotherapy programs is focused on the formulation of bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibodies for cancer. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is creating a range of BiTE antibodies for different types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumours. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is also developing therapies for cardiovascular diseases, including PCSK9 inhibitors, which can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.Here’s what Smead Capital Management said about Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9. Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)Market Capitalization: $142.81 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is a Paris, France-based biopharmaceutical company working on creating groundbreaking therapies for a range of diseases. One of Sanofi’s integral immunotherapy programs is focused on the growth of checkpoint inhibitors for cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors are designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells that prevent the immune system from attacking them. Sanofi is creating checkpoint inhibitors for a range of different cancers, including lung cancer, melanoma, and bladder cancer. Sanofi’s (NASDAQ:SNY) quarterly business operating income rose by 8.7% to 3.33 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2023. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.55% as of April 28.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Health care proved to be the most challenging sector to navigate during the quarter, as several companies were subjected to elevated risk aversion due to possible litigation implications. Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”8. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Market Capitalization: $147.84 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company. The corporation is exploring the use of various types of immunotherapies for cancer, including cell therapy and gene therapy. Furthermore, to enhance the production of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is acquiring a former Novartis plant to boost its viral vector production. The newly acquired facility, located in Libertyville, Illinois, will provide the company with in-house viral vector production capabilities for multiple products. BMS is also developing therapies for cardiovascular diseases, including therapies that can help to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) boasts an attractive dividend yield of 3.37% as of April 28.RGA Investment Advisors shared its stance on Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), which we referenced above, boasts a double digit free cash flow yield that gets divided roughly equally between repurchases, a dividend and M&amp;A in what is the best environment for acquisitions perhaps ever. In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”7. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Market Capitalization: $220.6 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a Basel, Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in the area of immunotherapy. The company has a diverse portfolio of immunotherapy programs and has formulated two CAR-T cell therapies, Kymriah and Tecartus, which have been approved for the treatment of several different types of cancer. According to the company’s 2023 earnings call transcript, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) had an impressive first quarter, characterized by significant sales growth, substantial margin expansion, and a consequent upgrade of the company’s full-year guidance for 2023. Novartis AG’s (NYSE:NVS) sales experienced an increase of 8%, while the core operating income witnessed a 15% rise in constant currencies.6. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Market Capitalization: $221.99 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based biopharmaceutical company with a strong foothold in the immunotherapy industry. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is exploring the use of other types of immunotherapies for cancer, including bispecific antibodies and cell therapies. The company’s bispecific antibody program is focused on creating therapies that can simultaneously target two different proteins in cancer cells, which may help to improve the effectiveness of the therapy. Additionally, the company’s cell therapy program focuses on utilizing T cells to target cancer cells, akin to CAR-T cell therapy. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 4.27% as of April 28.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”In addition to Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) are also some of the biggest immunotherapy companies in the world.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World.

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.1%. View our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. However, prior to this announcement, Mosaic's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 51.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 18%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.00 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.80. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 2.2% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Mosaic has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 59% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Mosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Mosaic is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Let's take a look at Boeing here closing the day in the green, up just about 2%. Ryanair saying that it plans to buy at least 150 737 MAX 10 planes from Boeing, also has the option to buy 150 more, so the potential total there for 300. The move puts a bridge over a long-running dispute over prices and delivery delays between Boeing and Ryanair. This is a boost that investors have been waiting for here from Boeing. Really signals here, Josh, in terms of the broader industry, the rebound that we've seen in travel. And so many of these airlines now looking to expand their fleet and replace some of those older plane models.- They're using the planes more. They got more people on them, so they need new ones, right? And I think that's a great thing when you're Boeing and you're in that business of, obviously, building planes for these airlines that are getting more busy. Again, you see this really being important to Boeing's top-line growth right when you're talking about revenue and getting more demand. That's something the company has been bullish on going back to their earnings call two weeks ago. They feel very confident in demand.The one thing that weighed on that stock, though, back a couple of weeks ago was the profit for the quarter and the overall profit outlook because Boeing has had some defect issues and supply chain issues that have impacted their deliveries. So that is something to watch moving forward, is can Boeing overcome that and continue to deliver planes and deliver them effectively as people keep ordering them.- Yeah, exactly. Well, shares, at least for today, closing in the green, up just about 2%.]"

Boeing securing a huge order from Ryanair worth $40 billion. Now the budget carrier agreeing to buy up to 307 37 Max Jets. Deliveries are going to start in 2027. And they will replace many of Ryanair's older aircraft.Now, in a statement, Ryanair Group CEO said that the new planes are going to offer 21% more seats while also burning 20% less fuel. And it wasn't all though good news for Boeing. We did see shares pull back from the highs of the session for just a bit after the company announced that its April deliveries fell by about half, comparing that to the March numbers that was due to a manufacturing defect. But [? Ally, ?] it looks like the Street is really focused on that order from Ryanair and what that could mean for maybe other orders here going forward given the recovery that we're starting to see in travel.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and I think it's across the board, right? We've heard positive news on the cruise line side, obviously with flights and airlines. That's a big deal as well. You know, Ryanair, I had a flight on Ryanair a few years ago.SEANA SMITH: Was it a positive [INAUDIBLE]?ALEXANDRA CANAL: It was not a positive experience. The plane landed on its side. And then we eventually leveled out. But we all lived to tell this story.SEANA SMITH: They need new planes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: They need new planes. I think it's the 20% increase for the amount of people, that'll be interesting. I hope that doesn't mean smaller seats. Because Ryanair is not the most comfortable airline. But, yeah, the return of travel. I think is definitely a big story that's driving the recovery.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: And it'll be interesting to see how Boeing-- not to say that there was a defect on the plane that you were on--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: --but overall deals with those defects, right? Because that was the big story a couple weeks ago when you go back to earnings for Boeing was the profit and how these defects have sort of weighed on what Boeing is able to do. Again, seeing a demand boost here in that top line continuing to grow. They reaffirmed guidance. But the problem has been profits. So what's going to come from Boeing in terms of avoiding some of these defects and being able to take advantage of demand will certainly be interesting to watch throughout the rest of the year.]"

Both sides blame each other for high drug prices.The CEOs of the major insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Co, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi, which together control 90% of the U.S. market, and top PBM executives from CVS Health Corp, Cigna Group's Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth Group Inc's Optum RX, which control 80% of the prescription drug market, will testify.Senator Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, is a fierce critic of both industries and will likely grill the executives.""The United States cannot continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs while drug companies and PBMs make billions in profits. That's what this hearing is all about,"" Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in a statement.Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson will argue that drugmakers pay substantial rebates aimed at lowering costs but that PBMs and insurers are incentivized to choose drugs with higher prices because they lead to larger rebates, according to his written testimony.Optum Rx CEO Heather Cianfrocco will say manufacturers alone set the drug prices and abuse patent protections to stifle competition, her written testimony shows.Around 8.4 million of the 37 million people in the United States with diabetes use insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association.Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi all said in March they were cutting list prices by more than 70% for some insulin products.Story continuesThe cuts could help around 2 million people pay for insulin. Although many people, including some 3.3 million on Medicare, pay $35 a month or less, about 1-in-5 with private insurance and the 17% of insulin users who are uninsured stand to benefit.Uninsured people often have to pay full list prices, an average of $900 a month, forcing many to ration or skip doses.Sanders has introduced a bill that caps all insulin list prices at $20 per vile and is working with Senator Bill Cassidy, the ranking Republican on the HELP Committee, on a bipartisan bill that strengthens government oversight over PBMs, one of several bills aimed at reducing drug prices.

Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others.Eli Lilly is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes and cancer drug Jaypirca already launched. Mounjaro sales are already benefiting from strong demand trends.However, the CRL for donanemab will probably delay the potential launch of the candidate.

However, United Parcel Service now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $97 billion. The new forecast is at the low end of the previous outlook and much lower than 2022's actual figure. According to the Zacks analyst estimate, it is currently pegged at $96.98 billion.The gloomy forecast is mainly due to weak consumer sales.

183,5a1fe8c5-ec65-37dc-b26e-ee52f0801fa7,NKE,2023-05-10,10 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-socially-responsible-stocks-125920309.html,1683637160,STORY,"['HD', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'XOM', 'PFE', 'COST', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best socially responsible stocks to buy according to analysts. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.Socially responsible investing is quickly becoming a norm rather than an exception as more and more people understand the importance of taking into account social conscience when making investment decisions. Socially responsible investing includes investing in companies that adhere to ethical or socially conscious business practices or steer clear of businesses or actions that harm the society according to many, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, carbon emissions, child labor, etc. Socially responsible investing, ESG investing and impact investing have all seen a huge rise in popularity over the past few years.According to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, assets in the ESG space were expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of 2022. Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.The Rise of Socially Responsible ETFsOne of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors it’s difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the company’s board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.Story continuesEngine No.1 in a scathing letter to ExxonMobil’s board of directors criticized the company’s lack of adherence to its goals and targets related to climate. Here’s what the historic letter said:In an apparent acknowledgment of investor sentiment, ExxonMobil has now gone from dismissing emissions reduction goals as a “beauty competition” to claiming repeatedly this month that its emissions reduction plans are “consistent” with the Paris Agreement.1 We have therefore reviewed the Company’s claims with a number of experts, including Professor David Victor at the University of California San Diego, who was a convening lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides the analysis that underpins the Paris Agreement. After doing so, we believe it is clear that, as detailed below, the Company’s true trajectory is nowhere near Paris consistency, and that a clear understanding of ExxonMobil’s claims underscores the long-term risk facing the Company in a decarbonizing world. None of the Company’s new claims change its long-term trajectory, which would grow total emissions for decades to come. This is not consistent with, but rather runs directly counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement. We also continue to believe that without new members of the Board with the necessary expertise and experience, ExxonMobil will have little choice but to continue seeking to create the appearance of transformative long-term change, rather than working to make it a reality.BacklashBut not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.For example, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF assets have dropped to $13.8 billion from $25 billion recorded a year ago, according to a Bloomberg report. The report said that as of March 2023, global assets of ESG ETFs were about $471 billion, as compared to $486 billion recorded in January. The report said that investors pulled a whopping $4.4 billion in a single week in March.The report also said the industry was facing a “concentration” problem, in which a handful of major funds were invested in the ESG space and when a single major fund decides to pull money from a fund, the overall industry sees a decline.Some investors are also getting frustrated with what they believe an overemphasis on environment in the ESG spectrum. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who is the cofounder of  Just Capital, believes worker treatment should be the center of the ESG equation and not the environment.According to CNBC, Jones said:“So much of ESG is politicized because the environmental part of the bucket seems to drive, or they would like to believe that the environmental part of it drives it, when in actuality the most important thing by a wide margin is how we pay and treat our workforce.”Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to AnalystsPhoto by GreenForce Staffing on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first scanned the  Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Investor Shares which seeks to track the performance of the FTSE4Good US Select Index.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter.Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla’s sales.We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company’s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors’ offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-v-f-184117872.html,1683657677,STORY,['VFC'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for V.F is US$25.55 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityV.F's US$22.21 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$29.52 analyst price target for VFC is 16% more than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for V.F Is V.F Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$215.6mUS$1.06bUS$1.20bUS$1.17bUS$1.16bUS$1.16bUS$1.17bUS$1.18bUS$1.20bUS$1.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x3Est @ -0.87%Est @ 0.02%Est @ 0.65%Est @ 1.09%Est @ 1.39%Est @ 1.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% -US$193US$852US$865US$758US$674US$605US$546US$495US$450US$410(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.5bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$4.5bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$9.9b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$22.2, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at V.F as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.578. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for V.FStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For V.F, there are three pertinent items you should consider:Risks: Be aware that  V.F is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are a bit concerning...Future Earnings: How does VFC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World.The immunotherapy industry is a rapidly growing field that is focused on developing treatments that harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer and other diseases. Many companies are involved in the immunotherapy industry, ranging from large pharmaceutical companies to small biotechnology startups. These companies are working to create a range of different immunotherapy treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. According to Markets and Markets, the revenue of the global immunotherapy drugs market was estimated to be $163.0 billion in 2020. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0% from 2020 to 2025, reaching a value of $274.6 billion by 2025. The global immunotherapy drugs market is classified based on therapeutic areas into cancer, autoimmune &amp; inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, and other therapeutic areas. Among these, cancer held the largest share of the global immunotherapy drugs market in 2019. The dominance of this segment is attributable to the high incidence of cancer, increasing research efforts in this field, and the provision of reimbursement coverage for oncology immunotherapies.The size of the global cancer immunotherapy industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% from $85.6 billion in 2020 to $309.67 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. The National Cancer Institute reported that in 2020, around 1,806,590 new cancer cases were reported in the United States, and 606,520 people died from the disease. Researchers believe that this rise in cancer incidence is expected to drive the growth of the immunotherapy industry in the coming years. In 2020, North America contributed the highest revenue to the cancer immunotherapy market due to increased expenditure on healthcare, a focus on maintaining a top healthcare system, and a rising incidence of cancer worldwide. Asia-Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to exhibit the highest CAGR during 2021-2030, primarily due to a surge in per capita income and an improvement in healthcare infrastructure.Story continuesSome of the key players in the immunotherapy industry include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Roche Holdings AG (ROG.SW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). These companies are investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) to bring new immunotherapy treatments to the market. The industry has witnessed significant progress in recent years in developing effective immunotherapies for various diseases. However, there are also challenges in the development of these treatments, including managing potential side effects and ensuring that they are accessible and affordable to patients worldwide.15 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the WorldPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 15 biggest immunotherapy companies in the world, we compiled a comprehensive list of companies that have a significant presence in the immunotherapy industry. This involved considering their involvement in immunotherapy research and development as well as their successful commercialization of immunotherapy products. Various factors such as product pipeline strength, market share, research and development efforts, product innovation, and global reach were considered to evaluate the commercial success of these companies. The companies have been ranked in ascending order based on their market capitalization as of April 28. We have also included the number of hedge fund holders for each of these companies as of Q4 2022.Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World15. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Market Capitalization: $40.81 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that is working on developing innovative therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. One of Biogen Inc.’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) integral immunotherapy programs is formulating therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. The company’s flagship MS therapy is called Tysabri, which is a monoclonal antibody that targets a molecule called α4-integrin. Tysabri works by preventing immune cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier, which can help lessen inflammation and damage to the nervous system. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) is also exploring other immunotherapy approaches for MS, including the creation of therapies that target B cells and other immune cells that are involved in the disease.ClearBridge Investments shared its outlook on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) was the leading contributor among several biopharma names, boosted by positive, pivotal clinical data for its next-generation Alzheimer’s treatment Lecanemab. In a pivotal trial, the drug proved safe and efficacious in slowing progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”14. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Market Capitalization: $52.03 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company involved in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics and vaccines. One of Moderna’s immunotherapy programs is focused on developing personalized cancer vaccines. These vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells based on the patient’s unique genetic profile. Moderna, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) personalized cancer vaccines are based on a combination of mRNA technology and machine learning algorithms, which are used to identify the specific mutations in a patient’s tumour that are most likely to provoke an immune response. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) has already made significant progress in creating mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19, with its mRNA-1273 vaccine gaining mainstream recognition globally.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) became a household name during the pandemic as one of the first developers of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the stock sold off sharply as COVID momentum, including high expectations for booster shots, began to wear off, causing investors to slash its fiscal 2023 earnings estimates by two-thirds over the last year. We believe those downward revisions clouded the prospects for the company’s fully funded pipeline of platform opportunities, including cancer, RSV and flu. The cash-rich company also recently expanded its partnership with Merck to improve cancer treatments.”13. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK)Market Capitalization: $52.65 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK) is a Tokyo, Japan-based pharmaceutical company developing state-of-the-art therapies for a range of different diseases, including oncology.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is working on creating a range of monoclonal antibodies for different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.Here’s what Bronte Capital said about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Market Capitalization: $107.05 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company. In a research note issued on February 14, Salim Syed at Mizuho increased the target for Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”10.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9. Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)Market Capitalization: $142.81 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is a Paris, France-based biopharmaceutical company working on creating groundbreaking therapies for a range of diseases.

Checkpoint inhibitors are designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells that prevent the immune system from attacking them. Sanofi is creating checkpoint inhibitors for a range of different cancers, including lung cancer, melanoma, and bladder cancer. Sanofi’s (NASDAQ:SNY) quarterly business operating income rose by 8.7% to 3.33 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2023. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.55% as of April 28.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Health care proved to be the most challenging sector to navigate during the quarter, as several companies were subjected to elevated risk aversion due to possible litigation implications. Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”8.

Furthermore, to enhance the production of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is acquiring a former Novartis plant to boost its viral vector production. The newly acquired facility, located in Libertyville, Illinois, will provide the company with in-house viral vector production capabilities for multiple products.

Here’s what the firm said:“Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), which we referenced above, boasts a double digit free cash flow yield that gets divided roughly equally between repurchases, a dividend and M&amp;A in what is the best environment for acquisitions perhaps ever. In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”7.

If you don't want to get into details, you can comfortably head to the 5 Most Used Prescription Drugs in the US. Prescription drugs have become an important part of healthcare in the US and around the world. These drugs are prescribed by healthcare providers to treat several diseases, be they acute infections or chronic diseases. Since they provide a more inexpensive alternative to brand-name treatments, the use of generic drugs has grown in popularity in recent years. According to the World Bank, the global economy dropped by 5.2% in 2022. People's healthcare expenses were significantly impacted by the economic decline, which led people to search for affordable but effective medications. As a result, the generic drug market experienced an abrupt growth in size, which turned out to be advantageous for the companies that make these medicines including Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Cipla Ltd among others. The generic drug business is extremely competitive, and the same medication is frequently produced by several producers. Price reductions are made possible by this competition, which also promotes industry innovation. According to reports, the size of the worldwide generic drug market was estimated at $439.37 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach USD 670.82 billion by 2030, increasing at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2022 to 2030. The Effects Of Covid-19 On The Generic Drug Market  Due to lockdown limitations and supply chain disruption during the early stages of the pandemic, COVID-19 has had a significant influence on the generic drug market. Talking about the demand side, there has been an extreme drug shortage at the pharmacy counter due to a run on medications. Patients filing more prescriptions than usual and seeking 90-day supplies rather than the typical 30 days have led to an increase in pharmacy ""stockouts"" even for medications that have no connection to COVID-19. For instance, patients who depend on chloroquine for chronic diseases have experienced shortages because of unfounded claims that the drug may treat coronavirus. Story continuesThe generic market has seen significant consolidation, which has reduced the number of prospective producers, reduced competition, and raised prices. This has also contributed to the concentration of manufacturing and sourcing in several countries. The majority of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are essential elements of medicines are imported. 80 percent of the APIs used in medications supplied in the United States come from China and India. Companies frequently use a single factory to produce their whole inventory, so if there is a disruption in one area, such as when the economy is shut down due to a pandemic, or a problem at a single plant, such as contamination or quality issues, it could result in a shortage. According to the life sciences analytical institute, COVID-19 raised pharmaceutical spending by $88 billion, or a shift in the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6%, compared to 4.5% if the pandemic hadn't occurred. Although it is anticipated that COVID-19 vaccine spending will increase the market by $157 billion through 2025 (with a range of $73 billion to $213 billion), the authors claim that the pandemic resulted in a $68 billion loss because of disruptions. According to the analysis, the market will spend about similarly to pre-pandemic levels overall, except for COVID-19 vaccines, and should have a 3% to 6% CAGR. The report says:“Perhaps the largest uncertainty in the next five years will be the potential impact of economic factors on countries' budgeting and whether there will be shifts in policies regarding healthcare and medicine spending. It is expected that the pricing and value of medicines will be under increased scrutiny during this period, but this was an event that was already underway in most developed markets and an increasingly key issue in the U.S. market.”Given the size of the global market for generic drugs, growth is expected to continue during the forecast period. The prevalence of chronic diseases, the rise in the number of elderly people, and rising healthcare costs are all reasons for this expansion. For instance, the International Diabetes Federation estimated that there were around 537 million individuals (20-79 years) living with diabetes worldwide in 2021, and that figure would increase to 643 million by 2030, and 783 million by 2045. Thus, based on the aforementioned considerations, it is anticipated that the market would expand significantly throughout the forecast period. Role Of The Key Players In The Growth Of The Generic Drug Market The main market players are also anticipated to assist the market's growth with a variety of organic and inorganic methods. Guanfacine XR, a generic version of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treatment medicine INTUNIV XR from Takeda Canada Inc., was introduced by Jamp Pharma Group in February 2022. Additionally, the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group in China submitted the initial marketing application for the class 3 generic drug Eslicarbazepine acetate, in October 2021, which is used to treat epileptic patients. Similarly, Sandoz, a world leader in generic and biosimilar medications, introduced Generic Ferumoxytol, an injectable medication used to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA), in the United States in July 2021. 20 Most Used Prescription Drugs In The USadriaticfoto/Shutterstock.com Our Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the 20 most used prescription drugs in the US in ascending order based on their total number of prescriptions as of 2022, for which the data is publicly available on the sources like Healthgrades and Clincalc among others. Here is our list of the 20 most used prescription drugs in the US:20.

189,5a1fe8c5-ec65-37dc-b26e-ee52f0801fa7,PFE,2023-05-10,10 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-socially-responsible-stocks-125920309.html,1683637160,STORY,"['HD', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'XOM', 'PFE', 'COST', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best socially responsible stocks to buy according to analysts. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.Socially responsible investing is quickly becoming a norm rather than an exception as more and more people understand the importance of taking into account social conscience when making investment decisions. Socially responsible investing includes investing in companies that adhere to ethical or socially conscious business practices or steer clear of businesses or actions that harm the society according to many, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, carbon emissions, child labor, etc. Socially responsible investing, ESG investing and impact investing have all seen a huge rise in popularity over the past few years.According to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, assets in the ESG space were expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of 2022. Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.The Rise of Socially Responsible ETFsOne of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors it’s difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the company’s board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.Story continuesEngine No.1 in a scathing letter to ExxonMobil’s board of directors criticized the company’s lack of adherence to its goals and targets related to climate. Here’s what the historic letter said:In an apparent acknowledgment of investor sentiment, ExxonMobil has now gone from dismissing emissions reduction goals as a “beauty competition” to claiming repeatedly this month that its emissions reduction plans are “consistent” with the Paris Agreement.1 We have therefore reviewed the Company’s claims with a number of experts, including Professor David Victor at the University of California San Diego, who was a convening lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides the analysis that underpins the Paris Agreement. After doing so, we believe it is clear that, as detailed below, the Company’s true trajectory is nowhere near Paris consistency, and that a clear understanding of ExxonMobil’s claims underscores the long-term risk facing the Company in a decarbonizing world. None of the Company’s new claims change its long-term trajectory, which would grow total emissions for decades to come. This is not consistent with, but rather runs directly counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement. We also continue to believe that without new members of the Board with the necessary expertise and experience, ExxonMobil will have little choice but to continue seeking to create the appearance of transformative long-term change, rather than working to make it a reality.BacklashBut not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.For example, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF assets have dropped to $13.8 billion from $25 billion recorded a year ago, according to a Bloomberg report. The report said that as of March 2023, global assets of ESG ETFs were about $471 billion, as compared to $486 billion recorded in January. The report said that investors pulled a whopping $4.4 billion in a single week in March.The report also said the industry was facing a “concentration” problem, in which a handful of major funds were invested in the ESG space and when a single major fund decides to pull money from a fund, the overall industry sees a decline.Some investors are also getting frustrated with what they believe an overemphasis on environment in the ESG spectrum. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who is the cofounder of  Just Capital, believes worker treatment should be the center of the ESG equation and not the environment.According to CNBC, Jones said:“So much of ESG is politicized because the environmental part of the bucket seems to drive, or they would like to believe that the environmental part of it drives it, when in actuality the most important thing by a wide margin is how we pay and treat our workforce.”Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to AnalystsPhoto by GreenForce Staffing on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first scanned the  Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund Investor Shares which seeks to track the performance of the FTSE4Good US Select Index.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter.Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla’s sales.We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company’s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors’ offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems Inc., which sued Fox for defamation over claims about it rigging the 2020 presidential election, uncovered evidence that Carlson had insulted management, colleagues and guests. Fox settled the Dominion suit for a record $787.5 million.Carlson’s next move had become a topic of fascination in media circles. In recent days, Axios reported that Carlson and Twitter owner Elon Musk had discussed working together. Axios reported on Tuesday that a lawyer for Carlson sent Fox a letter accusing the network of fraud and breach of contract for leaking private messages to the media. The letter demanded documents that could lead to legal action.Representatives of Fox and Carlson declined to comment.Carlson’s announcement that he’ll be starting a new show on Twitter had ripple effects across the conservative media landscape. Shares of Rumble Inc., a conservative online video network, dropped as much as 14% in post-market trading.In the video, Carlson didn’t directly address his departure from Fox, but said “the best you can hope for in the news business at this point is the freedom to tell the fullest truth that you can, but there are always limits. And you know if you bump up against those limits often enough, you will be fired for it.”Carlson added that “there aren’t many platforms left that allow free speech. The last big one remaining in the world — the only one — is Twitter.”Story continuesAt the end of his video, the screen listed his website, TuckerCarlson.com, and invited viewers to text him.Twitter has become an increasingly hostile place for journalists and media companies since Musk took over. Reporters who covered Musk and the company have had their accounts suspended. NPR quit Twitter last month after Musk labeled its account “state-affiliated media,” along with those for the BBC, PBS and other publicly funded organizations.In tweet of his own on Tuesday, Musk said he hadn’t signed any deal, an apparent reference to Carlson.“On this platform, unlike the one-way street of broadcast, people are able to interact, critique and refute whatever he or anyone may say,” Musk said.(Updates with Musk comments in final paragraphs.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-ColaHow Normalizing Menopause Can Help Employers Retain Senior WomenVenezuela Brain Drain Enriches Panama and Other NeighborsAI Drug Discovery Is a $50 Billion Opportunity for Big PharmaYour Ad Data Is Now Powering Government Surveillance©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The company recently announcing that it's slashing its workforce and shutting down its news division. Now, this follows results from Fox, which reported a $50 million loss in the third quarter tied to expenses relating to its settlement with Dominion.With so much happening in the media world, we want to bring in ""Washington Post"" media reporter Elahe Izadi. Elahe, it's great to see you again here. So, of course, let's start with Fox because it's the first public comments that we've got in from Lachlan Murdoch since the settlement with Dominion, also since the firing of Tucker Carlson. What did you make of the results that we got today and what we heard from Murdoch?ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, a few things. One, Tucker Carlson was not mentioned by name. But it's notable that since he's been fired, the ratings for Fox News at his hour have dropped dramatically. And today, Lachlan Murdoch made no indication that they're going to divert or change their editorial strategy. It seemed to be, if you read between the lines, that Carlson's firing represented a tweaking of a strategy but that there would be no departure from what Fox has done for many years and for some time.The other thing that was notable was an acknowledgment that the settlement had a cost to the company and that, in this case, Lachlan Murdoch made mention that Fox was limited in what they could argue at trial and that he said something to the effect of we settled this to not drag this out.But the very notable thing to me is what was said about another lawsuit that Fox News is facing against another voting technology company called Smartmatic. That is a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit that we do not expect to go to trial, if it does make it to trial, until 2025.Story continuesAnd Lachlan Murdoch said something to the effect of, well, this case is fundamentally different. I'm not sure how different it is. We are going to see how that proceeds. But it is a different company. It's going to be a different state. It's going to unfold perhaps differently, but they're still a ways out.And then the other thing that's notable is that Fox also is facing several shareholder lawsuits for how the company handled the lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which ended with a settlement of $770-- $778.5 million, about half of what was there. But the company did incur a loss. The $50 million loss, net loss in this quarter, if you compare it to the same period last year, same period last year they posted over $200 million gain for that period.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Elahe, did you get a sense that Fox is just trying to leave all of these issues in the past because it didn't seem like they wanted to address the severity of the events that have taken place over the last several months pertaining specifically to the Dominion lawsuit, also to what we heard from Tucker Carlson, the decision to fire him. And then Smartmatic, it seemed like they almost just wanted to dismiss the risks that that would potentially pose here to shareholders given the sheer size of it.ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, I think the argument here and from when this news of the settlement came out and Fox put out a statement was that they want to put this behind them. They don't want this to drag on and that it serves in everyone's best interest to just end this matter and move on. They're still fighting in court over redactions being unveiled because there's still some things that we-- even though so much was made public during the Dominion legal fight through discovery that there were still some of these private internal communications that were redacted.And Fox has argued that a settlement took place precisely so that this matter could be ended and move on. And, yeah, I'm projecting a sense of the company is in good shape. Revenue did go up by 18%. It did post a loss, obviously, due to these legal fights but that the argument here is that it was in the best interests of the company financially going forward to settle and not to worry about the Smartmatic case.SEANA SMITH: Elahe, what's your sense of the sluggish ad market because there have been some hope that we would start to see a recovery? I think when you take a look at some of the tech giants that reported several weeks ago, they had shown some signs that things were improving. Yet when you take a look at some of these media companies, it doesn't seem like that's exactly translated here to some of the traditional media players. Is that in line with what you're seeing? And I guess, what does that tell us just about the next several months?ELAHE IZADI: In every memo about company-wide layoffs from digital startups to legacy media companies, there has made mention of a soft ad market and that this is something that media companies are still grappling with. I don't know if it's so much as the reality on the ground or concerns and to forecasting of what's around the corner and having to mitigate for that. And also, it's important to note that for a lot of companies, it's the ad market, but it's also audience numbers and that if the market-- if you have a lot of audience but the ad market is soft, it doesn't matter how many people are viewing your content if the ad market is soft. And so there's a calculation going into there.But, yes, I still think this is a concern at many media companies that the ad market is still soft and that ad revenue has gone down. During the pandemic, in the beginning, we did see a lot more audience numbers, that audience numbers went up for a lot of journalism and a lot of news content. The ad-- the ad market was soft. And I still think that there is this concern right now with uncertainty in the economy and I read in every single layoff memo that comes across my desk.SEANA SMITH: And when you take a look at some of the trends that are going on within the media space, a lot of these disruptors, it seems like, is having a hard time competing with the more traditional players within the media. Take a look at what's happening to Vice, the fact that BuzzFeed shut down its news division. What do you think this signals just about the future media landscape and what that's going to look like?ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, it's interesting if we look at specifically Vice and BuzzFeed. I would say they're in one of the earlier iterations of disruptors because a lot of the practices that especially BuzzFeed engaged in, outlets like ""The New York Times"" and ""The Washington Post"" started adopting those practices or poaching their reporters and doing listicles and that sort of thing. And that was in the 2010s. And I think in those cases what you saw was a lot of venture capital invested into-- and a lot of funding into these companies, and they couldn't expand fast enough to meet that investment.But at the same time, as we were seeing Vice probably heading into bankruptcy, BuzzFeed News shutting down and BuzzFeed trying to figure out how to get on firmer financial footing, we still see new digital media outlets getting into the space, raising capital. The Messenger is about to start with 150 employees. They already acquired another venture startup, Grid News, and shut that down.And so I always say whenever you have a space like media where there is a lot of volatility and people trying to figure out how to make this business model work or what can work, you're always going to have experimentation. And within that experimentation, there will be failures.SEANA SMITH: And as we were talking here in just the last couple of minutes, Tucker Carlson actually just tweeted out we're back and that he's taking his show to Twitter, reaching a deal with Elon Musk. What do you think of that?ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, I think they had some conversations, reportedly. And Twitter and Elon Musk, that's a whole other-- that's a whole other conversation, right, and how disruptive that can be. But, you know, in that, there is always this sort of existential question with Fox whether these really popular personalities on Fox are popular because they're on Fox or they bring viewers to Fox.Now, we see in the past week or two since Tucker Carlson has been fired and is no longer in that time slot, the ratings have dropped dramatically. Fox could promote a new personality in and put them and they could be successful in that time slot. And I think that's going to be something to watch. Will Tucker Carlson be able to get as much prominence, as much influence, and as many viewers on Twitter as he did on Fox? Who makes who powerful?SEANA SMITH: That is a very, very good point because we know in the past that that hasn't exactly happened, that Fox News viewers stay very loyal to Fox News rather than following the big personalities there. Elahe Izadi, thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.]"

Murdoch, who answered questions from financial analysts, was speaking in public for the first time since the case ended and Fox fired its most popular anchor, Tucker Carlson.Murdoch said viewers, and investors, should expect no change in direction from Fox News.“We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and multi-year appeal process, a decision clearly in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,” he said.Fox still believes it was properly exercising its First Amendment rights to report on newsworthy fraud allegations made by former President Donald Trump, even though that defense was shot down in a pre-trial court ruling in the Dominion case, Murdoch said.That's important, since Murdoch said Fox intends to use the same defense against a similar lawsuit by another elections technology company, Smartmatic. That case is not expected to go to trial until at least 2025, he said.Despite being asked directly about Carlson's exit, Murdoch didn't mention the former prime-time host's name and referred to his reign obliquely. Fox has not explained why it cut ties with Carlson.“There's no change in programming strategy at Fox News,” he said. “It's obviously a successful strategy. As always, we are adjusting our programming and our lineup and that's what we continue to do.”Story continuesAlthough hurt by the Carlson exit, Fox News remains the leading cable news network.Fox has lost viewers following Carlson's firing. Last week's substitute host, Lawrence Jones, reached between 1.28 million and 1.7 million last week in a time slot where Carlson usually drew around 3 million, the Nielsen company said.Yet Fox has gained more than 40 new advertisers in that hour, the network said, confirming a report in Variety. Advertisers like Gillette, Scott's Miracle Gro and Secret deodorant that had considered Carlson's show a toxic environment have signed on.]"

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Fox's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Fox How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:13% = US$1.5b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Fox's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Fox's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Fox's five year net income decline of 8.0% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Fox's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 8.0% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is FOXA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Fox Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 18% (or a retention ratio of 82%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.In addition, Fox has been paying dividends over a period of four years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is preferred by the management even though earnings have been in decline. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 21% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Fox's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Fox has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

Our Josh Schafer joining us here on set to break it all down and kicking it off with PayPal. Look at those losses today, finishing in the red, off nearly 13% as the company turns to AI in an effort to appeal to investors. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman saying on the company's earnings call that they expect AI is going to enable them to meaningfully lower cost for years to come.Actually, the numbers for the most recent quarter weren't that bad. They came in better than the Street was expecting in terms of some of the payment volume that we did see. But this is another tech company relying on AI, saying that how they're going to use that to their business to really boost their business down the line.JOSH SCHAFER: And it sort of came up in the call, because part of the call was about margins, right? And they were talking about, essentially, Paypal's margins, the guidance was not quite what the Street was looking for, coming in a little bit lower. And that's because part of what's driving Paypal's growth right now is their lower margin, non-consumer-facing business.And so when you take a look at sort of how to build that back and cut costs, one thing they turn to and mentioned was AI, which is interesting because they didn't specifically say it. But since IBM pointed out last week that AI might be able to replace some jobs and cut costs that way, I think you have some people sort of speculating here, well, if PayPal is going to use AI to significantly cut costs and make things more efficient, what exactly does that mean?Does that mean a decrease in headcount. Of course, it could. And I think that's where things got interesting there when you think about PayPal. But as you said, Seana, they didn't see really that volume decline. I know that's something we're going to be watching after the bell here when we think about a firm in the buy now, pay later space and if people are still buying, essentially.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And I think also, a lot of people want to know who could potentially or who will potentially replace Shulman at the end of the year when he is expected to retire. We know PayPal has looked to cut costs here just a few months ago, announcing that they were going to be trimming 7% of the workforce, about 2000 full-time workers. So maybe AI could potentially lead to more layoffs.]"

Quantum technology is rapidly advancing. Quantum systems are on a path to solve previously unsolved problems beneficial to business and science, but this progress also poses security risks. As quantum computers continue to advance, they will reach the ability to break the most widely used security protocols in the world.Recognizing this risk, IBM has leveraged its extensive expertise across cryptography, quantum computing, and critical infrastructure to develop IBM Quantum Safe technology.This set of capabilities is designed to help clients prepare for the post-quantum era via:IBM Quantum Safe Explorer to enable organizations to scan source and object code to locate cryptographic assets, dependencies, vulnerabilities and to build a Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM). This allows teams to view and aggregate potential risks into one central location.IBM Quantum Safe Advisor allows the creation of a dynamic or operational view of cryptographic inventory to guide remediation and analyzes cryptographic posture and compliance to prioritize risks.IBM Quantum Safe Remediator enables organizations to deploy and test best practice-based quantum-safe remediation patterns to understand the potential impacts on systems and assets as they prepare to deploy quantum-safe solutions.IBM is also unveiling its IBM Quantum Safe Roadmap to help clients understand and support them through this security transition. This is IBM's first blueprint that charts the technology milestones towards increasingly advanced quantum-safe technology, which is engineered to help organizations address anticipated cryptographic standards and requirements through crypto-agility and protect systems against emerging vulnerabilities.Story continuesThis journey is comprised of three key actions:Discover: Identify cryptography usage, analyze dependencies, and generate a CBOM.Observe: Analyze cryptography posture of vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation based on risks.Transform: Remediate and mitigate with crypto-agility and built-in automation.""As a leader in quantum computing, IBM recognizes the importance of comprehensively addressing the critical needs of our clients as they also consider transforming their cryptography for the quantum era,"" said Ray Harishankar, IBM Fellow and lead for IBM Quantum Safe technology. ""Our new suite of quantum-safe technologies and milestones laid out on our roadmap is designed for the continuous evolution of post-quantum security in tandem with useful quantum computing, including solutions to help industries navigate this shift effectively and easily.""Last year, the United States government released new requirements and guidelines calling upon federal agencies to start the quantum-safe transition. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected four quantum-resistant algorithms for standardization — three of which were developed by IBM, alongside academic and industry collaborators.Then, the National Security Agency (NSA) announced new requirements for national security systems to transition to quantum-safe algorithms by 2025, and the White House released requirements for federal agencies to submit a cryptographic inventory of systems that could be vulnerable to cryptographically relevant quantum computers.""As the era of quantum computing quickly approaches reality, it is imperative that quantum-safe technologies are also deployed to protect today's classical systems and data,"" said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and founder of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. ""What the world needs to secure data for the quantum age is expertise in world-class quantum technology and advanced cryptography, alongside decades of product development experience for critical infrastructure. These pillars are where I believe IBM excels, and now with a quantum-safe roadmap to lead the industry and new technologies to simplify migration, I look forward to seeing the advancement of quantum-safe journeys globally.""The IBM Quantum Safe Roadmap and technology will expose organizations to their existing cryptographic landscape so they can begin to address changes that may be necessary to thrive in the post-quantum era.For more information about IBM Quantum Safe technology or to request a demo, visit: https://www.ibm.com/quantum/quantum-safe.Media Contacts:Chris Naycnay@us.ibm.comWilla Hahnwilla.hahn@ibm.comIBM Corporation logo. SOURCE IBM]"

What an exciting time for EVgo and for the EV industry overall. We believe we're participating in a once in a century sectoral transformation that is underway and unstoppable. As a market leader with a strong track record of delivery today, EVgo is looking forward to pursuing a plethora of value creating growth opportunities that lie ahead.Building on our strong 2022, EVgo started 2023 with a phenomenal quarter of growth in all core areas, stalls in operation, networks throughput, and revenue. In Q1, EVgo delivered over $25 million in revenue, representing 229% year-over-year revenue growth. Network throughput was 17.9 gigawatt hours, an increase of a 124% from the first quarter of 2022. And network throughput is growing significantly faster than electric vehicles and operations, demonstrating the leverage of EVgo's fundamental business thesis.EVgo increased stalls in operation or under construction to around 3,100 at the end of the first quarter, growing 48% year-over-year. We energized a record of approximately 220 new stalls in the quarter, a 69% increase from the first quarter of 2022. Utilization on the network is growing rapidly as well. The top 10% of EVgo stalls have utilization greater than 25%. And the top 20% of stalls demonstrate utilization of over 20%.California, taking its entirety across all metropolitan, corridor, and rural markets had state-wide utilization above 10%. We're seeing metro areas in Texas, Florida, and Nevada with double-digit utilization as well. These up into the right results from Q1, and those we reported on our last earnings call from the entirety of 2022 are a testament to the long-term opportunity at EVgo that you've heard us describe since it became a public company a couple years ago.Today, I'll lean into 3 key pillars supporting EVgo's success. First, EVgo's business model is leveraged to increasing EV adoption. When EV sales grow, EVgo's business grows with it. Second, EVgo's robust market position is built on a foundation of value creating blue-ribbon partnerships with OEMs, governments, site hosts, and suites. These commercial partnerships continue to grow and expand. And third, EVgo's technology leadership is charting the course for EV charging and EV ownership more broadly, creating the means for individual drivers, fleet businesses, automakers, retailers, and governments to seamlessly be part of the transportation revolution that is upon us.First, let's talk about EVgo's business model leveraged to the growth in EVs. The market for electric vehicle is continuing to grow at a blistering pace. In 2022, there were 2.2 million EV's in operation. And that is expected to grow to over 33 million by 2030, a 40% compound annual growth rate. Bloomberg's 2022 BNEF report predicted that more than half of all passenger cars sold in the U.S. will be EV by 2030. And I'll note, optimistically, that we've already exceeded BNEF's originally EV adoption figures for the early part of this decade.As mass adoption of EV is underway in the United States, there is a need for more charging and more fast charging in particular. S&amp;P Global has predicted that the U.S. would need approximately 170,000 fast chargers by 2030, an 8x growth from today. Apartment dwellers, high mileage drivers, such as rideshare drivers, and fleets are all going electric. And EVgo has found that even drivers who primarily charge at home rely on fast charging for day tripping, longer road trips, and even kilowatt hour top-ups while doing errands around town. Hence, the increase in utilization I referenced earlier that we're witnessing in a growing number of markets across the country well beyond California.We're committed to building this business in a manner that is sustainable and highly profitable for our shareholders. As you know, EVgo's core business is an asset ownership. We carefully invest in charging infrastructure where we believe it will deliver our targeted returns through ever increasing asset utilization. We operate a best-in-class public network and expanding that own network to new geographies that pass our rigorous investment hurdles. And we own and operate charging assets for a variety of suite customers.In addition, we apply our expertise in sighting, building and operating charging infrastructure to accretive capital light business lines serving both retail and fleet segments. EVgo eXtend and our behind-the-fence offerings to fleets expand EVgo's competitive position and broaden EVgo's customer reach, while providing us with additional predictable recurring revenue streams as a builder, operator, and integrator, but insulating us from utilization risk in markets where we don't want that exposure. Building a business leveraged to rising EV adoption has proven to be a sound commercial thesis.Next, let's talk about the important pillar of partnerships to EVgo's market leadership and financial position. EVgo has a long history in cultivating lasting business relationships with marquee partners that create meaningful commercial win-wins. On the OEM side, you've heard us discuss GM, Toyota, Subaru, and Nissan in particular. And the countless brand name retail partnerships like Target, Safeway, Kroger, Whole Foods, Home Depot, Lowe's, Chase Bank, and the recent addition Chipotle, where on-site fast charging creates foot traffic for brick-and-mortar stores and restaurants. EVgo's partnerships with utilities and government funders are equally important financial contributors to our growth to date, and we expect them to continue to date.With respect to our current auto manufacturer partners, OEMs provide EVgo with capital funding to offset development costs. They create and pay for fast charging credit programs to attract EV drivers to EVgo, or they procure EVgo's proprietary software solutions to enhance their EV driver's experience. And with the OEM investment in EV's on the rise, we're hopeful EVgo's collaboration with the OEM will deepen further.GM, the #1 U.S. carmaker in 2022, and one of EVgo's landmark partners, is investing more than $35 billion in electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles over the next several years. In February, GM committed to producing about 400,000 EVs during 2024, a steppingstone to meet its goal of reaching annual production of 1 million EVs by 2025. GM has announced they will have 9 EV models available in the U.S. by the end of this year, including versions of the popular Chevy Silverado pickup truck, as well as the Equinox and Blazer SUV.Nissan accelerated its EV plans in the U.S. and committed nearly $18 billion to electrify more of its overall line-up. Nissan plans to introduce 19 EVs by 2030, an increase from its original goal of 15. They expect 44% of total sales will be electric by then.Toyota, building on their introduction of the fully electric bZ4X last year, is investing $35 billion in EVs globally. Similarly, Subaru, which introduced the Solterra last year, expects to offer several more EV models by 2025 as it continues to ramp its investments in electrification.With EVgo being leveraged to growth and EVs on the road, these are particularly exciting commitments from EVgo's partner OEM. Another important area is rideshare, where EVgo's partnerships with both Lyft and Uber continue to deliver both network throughput and revenue, as well as positive environmental benefits to the communities in which drivers on their platform live and work.As we shared before, rideshare drivers are ideal customers for fast charging. A rideshare driver typically drives more in a day than most people do in a week and may need to be able to charge fast so they can get back on the road. With such a user profile, we see Uber and Lyft drivers increasing utilization on our network significantly with Q1 throughput more than tripling from a year ago. Both Uber and Lyft are great partners and are heavily marketing the benefits of EVs for both their drivers and their riders. Uber's Comfort Electric option is now available in nearly 40 cities throughout North America, an important step in the company's effort to reach an EV-only fleet by 2030. Likewise, this is helping drivers make the switch to EVs, offering a cash bonus for drivers who offer at least 50 rides using a qualified EV.Site hosts are also important partners at EVgo. We provide the charging. Our site hosts partners offer great amenities while a driver charges. And our relationships with these marquee partners are deepening. Through our sophisticated network planning tool, EVgo has identified literally thousands of locations across America where shareholder value could be created if EVgo builds a fast-charging station at that partner site.Earlier today in our earnings release, EVgo announced we had entered into a new agreement to expand our collaboration with Chevron, first launched in 2015 to develop EV charging sites in major California markets. EVgo will now offer Chevron and Texaco locations across the U.S. turnkey fast charging solutions with a variety of ownership models, including EVgo eXtend. There are more than 8,000 Chevron and Texaco retail stations across the U.S. that will have access to EVgo's expertise and solutions, including fast chargers up to 350 kilowatts. Under the agreement, EVgo will provide hardware, design, and construction of charging at these sites, as well as operations and maintenance, networking, and software solutions. Chevron and its independently owned retailer and marketer network will also be well-positioned to take advantage of the funding available through the government's National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure or NEVI program.With Chevron as the latest example of a deepening retailer partnership, EVgo is excited about the opportunity to bring more convenient fast charging options to EV drivers wherever they need to be. And on fleet, the deepening of partner relationship is again the theme for this quarter with additional sites added by 2 of EVgo's current fleet partners. MHX, a Class 8 truck fleet, and a national food and beverage company are each building their second EVgo dedicated fleet charging site with each also using EVgo Optima as their fleet management software. While it's still early days in fleet electrification, we're excited to have EVgo's business grow alongside the EV investments fleet operators are making as more vehicles become available to them.EVgo's partnership with government policy makers is critical to our success as well. And the federal government recently announced it is taking more bold action to spur even faster growth of electrification. On top of the investments under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, that we discussed on our last earnings call, In April, the Biden administration announced a tighter overall regulatory framework for the auto industry, including new vehicle ignition standards through 2032. Once the new emission standards are in place, the EPA estimates that EVs could account for 60% of all new passenger car sales by 2030 and 67% by 2032. Notably, this would surpass even BNEF forecast.Now returning to the $5 billion in federal funding through the NEVI program that I just mentioned, the latest is that this particular tailwind is more like a tail breathes at the moment, directionally terrific, but moving more slowly than originally indicated by government officials. The status is this. No states have made NEVI awards yet. Several states have released RFPs and are reviewing proposals from EVgo and others. And the vast majority of states haven't yet solicited proposals from the industry, partially because the state's original program design needed to incorporate the final program guidelines and by America requirements that the federal government issued in February. Notwithstanding the current time lag, however, EVgo remains excited about the potential to apply NEVI funds to both owned assets and stations deployed under EVgo eXtend, with the majority of financial benefits likely to be realized in 2024 and beyond.Similarly, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for the expansion and extension of 30C tax credits under the IRA. But while new guidance for the consumer vehicle tax credit has been issued, the IRS has not yet issued any further implementation guidance for the 30C in infrastructure tax credit. The industry is eagerly awaiting Treasury's guidance.And finally, let me turn to the third pillar of EVgo's success, technology innovation. We've been a technology leader in the EV charging space, and innovation continues to be an important differentiator for EVgo, creating value for drivers and for deepening and widening our own competitive moat. I mean, think about it. Now that we can all do one click ordering on Amazon or cashless car service with an app or electronic boarding passes when we fly, it's sometimes hard to remember the olden times really less than 10 years ago when we had to place orders by phone or get cash from an ATM or stand in a long line at the airport to get a paper boarding pass. The EV industry is young, and our aim at EVgo is to make the easy charging experience as seamless as one-click ordering. This requires a highly sophisticated approach to our own technology.While we don't manufacture the charging hardware, we painstakingly specify the attributes of each charging product we deploy, undertaking rigorous premarket testing in our lab related to charger performance, interoperability, and reliability. In fact, a couple of weeks ago, EVgo hosted research leaders from a number of the Department of Energy's National Laboratory for a detailed run through of the anatomy of a charging session and the industry-wide imperatives for creating uniform reliability and enhanced customer experience.As you've heard me say, EVgo's fast chargers are complex machines that run hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and connect in real time to our network management platform and customer facing applications, which in-turn run millions of lines of code and integrate dozens of additional platforms across the EV ecosystem such as payment processing, industry enrollment partners, and EV OEMs, the correct functioning of all of which is essential to creating an exemplary customer experience.Practically speaking, EV chargers close to 50 different models of EVs on our network today, each with its own unique charging behavior governed by battery performance and software. A technology marriage has to work not just between EVgo's charging hardware and full software stack, but also between our EV chargers and the hardware and software of the EV itself, and between EV chargers and driver's cell phone, and between EV chargers and utilities delivering the electricity to the chargers and between EV chargers and site host retailers and between the EV charging networks with whom we interoperate.At EVgo, we welcome these demands, and in fact, we've upped the anti, looking beyond basic functionality. We created Autocharge+ so the drivers can charge their car without swiping a credit card or tapping an app. We built EVgo Reservations, so a driver can be sure a charger is available when they need one. We built EVgo Inside, so that OEMs could help their customers find the closest charging station in the dash of their EV. We built Pay with PlugShare to both find chargers and help manage charging, which we are currently piloting at all of EVgo's chargers in the LA area. We've partnered with Amazon, so that a driver will soon be able to ask Alexa to help them find a charger. And we built EVgo Advantage to give drivers special deals while they charge. And today, announced the latest offering here, entering into a new agreement with Audible to bring trial memberships to EVgo customers later in 2023 delivering audiobook to EV drivers while they charge.From deploying the first 350-kilowatt charger in the U.S. to pioneering power sharing technology, to where we are today, EVgo is setting the benchmarks of what the EV driver experience should be and what our B2B partners will count on when serving their EV driving customers. With innovation in our DNA, you can bet there's more good stuff to come.With that, I'll turn the call over to EVgo's CFO, Olga, to give more detail on first quarter results.Olga ShevorenkovaThank you, Cathy. EVgo continues to build on our track record of growth and execution in the first quarter of 2023. EVgo added about 220 new stalls to our network during the quarter. And stalls in operation or under construction were approximately 3,100 at quarter-end. Both active engineering and construction stall development pipeline ended the quarter at around 3,500 stalls.First quarter revenue of $25.3 million grew 229% year-over-year. This significant increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued execution of our EVgo eXtend contract with Pilot Flying J in partnership with General Motors and growing charging revenue.Adjusted gross margin declined from 37.2% in the first quarter of 2022 to 25.3% in the first quarter of 2023, due to accelerated revenue recognition of regulatory credits in Q1 2022 and lower LCFS pricing this year. Adjusted gross margin of 25.3% in the first quarter of 2023 improved versus the fourth quarter of 2022 due to annual breakage revenue recognition in the network revenue OEM business line of approximately 2.1 million.Adjusted G&amp;A as percent of revenue declined from 273% in the first quarter of 2022 to 105% in the first quarter of 2023, illustrating the leverage EVgo continues to realize with investments in G&amp;A, both administrative and gross driven payroll and non-payroll investments. We reported adjusted EBITDA of negative $20.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 versus negative $18.2 million in Q1 2022.Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $163.8 million as of March 31, 2023. CapEx was $65.2 million during the first quarter as EVgo continued to execute against our long-term charge of deployment plan. Roughly 50% of this number was driven by equipment prepayments and delivery for the rest of 2023 needs. Such CapEx levels are not representative of this year's quarterly run rate.In April, EVgo raised $5.7 million in net proceeds by issuing approximately 890,000 shares of Class A common stock turned at the market equity offering. We anticipate using the ATM opportunistically going forward, and we have $183.5 million of capacity remaining under the ATM program.Now looking at network trends in the first quarter. As auto manufacturers release new models of EVs and ramp production, electric vehicles in operations, or VIO increases steadily, driving EVgo revenues as EVgo's business model is centered around the leverage to the adoption, as Cathy mentioned.At the end of 2022, there were 2.2 million EVs in operation, and it is estimated that during the first quarter of 2023, this climbed by another 300,000 EVs to 2.5 million overall on the U.S. roads. EVgo's network throughput continued to significantly outpace our operational stall growth and EV VIO growth. Total kilowatt hours dispensed were 17.9 million, a 124% year-over-year increase compared to operational stall growth of 33% and EV VIO growth of 53% over the same time period. This is driven by an increasing contribution of rideshare traffic on our network.As a reminder, an average commuter drives 11,000 miles a year, an average rideshare driver drives 40,000 to 60,000 miles a year when driving full-time and relies much more on DC charging. Network throughput also rose as a result of increased EV battery sizes and higher reliance on public charging by our newer retail customers versus early adopters who relied mostly on home-charging.Average monthly throughput per active customer has increased by more than 1/3 over the last 12 months. EVgo markets with high EV adoption rates continue to demonstrate solid utilization levels. California showed consistent double-digit utilization with Los Angeles being the top market and posting 14.4% utilization in Q1. Nationally, key markets in Texas, Florida, and Nevada are among Top 10 performers with consistent double-digit utilizations as well.When looking at top performing stalls on EVgo network, all-in high EV adoption rates markets, we're clearly observing that they are already in-line with our long-term per-stall annual revenue targets. Average revenue per-stall is expected to further increase driven by high utilization with more EVs on the roads and higher charge rates of the EVs themselves.When taking a look at top 10% stall and top 20% stall measured by utilization on our whole network, as Cathy mentioned, we're observing consistent utilization in excess of 25% and 20% respectively, clearly signaling potential for additional markets to realize such levels with increasing EV adoption. The average charge rate realized at EVgo site is increasing due to improving battery capabilities of the EVs and EVgo's ongoing efforts to switch to higher powered equipment. These higher average charge rates on our network mean more kilowatt hour dispensed every hour when somebody is charging, driving profitability of our projects up.Average network charge rate is poised for an increased over time, further driven by new vehicles with bigger batteries coming online. Such network trends are reinforcing our thesis on the business being leveraged to easy adoption and proving the advantages of our scalable business model underpinned by attractive public network project economics. As a reminder, we deployed capital following rigorous investment criteria and underwrite our portfolio to robust double-digit pre-tax unlevered IRRs.With the assets deployed in the next 24 months, we expect our CapEx per-stall to be between $130,00 and $150,000 with roughly 60% of it being labor and materials and the remainder being equipment with an 8 year to 10 year useful life assumed. Useful life range depends on the type of charger deployed and the site type. CapEx per-stall is anticipated to decline as we near 2030, driven by the industry lowering curve on the equipment side. Upsetting the capital cost is funding from partner automakers and/or grant funding at the local, state or federal government level.As is central to our business thesis and the commercial opportunity in front of us, EVgo plans to continue to grow our public network as EV adoption increases. The upshot is that when there are 40 million electric vehicles on U.S. roads, EVgo expects to operate 25,000 to 30,000 public stalls, all underwritten to our internal profitability hurdles.As we discussed during our last earnings call, the public network is our core business and is expected to contribute 75% to 80% of EVgo revenues over time. Our fleet hub, eXtend, and ancillary businesses will remain natural and accretive compliment to our core business model, providing an optimal risk return profile to EVgo.EVgo is affirming our full-year revenue guidance of $105 million to $150 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $78 million to negative $60 million. We expect to have a total of 3,400 to 4,000 DC fast charging stalls in operation or under construction at the end of 2023. As a reminder, this metric includes PFJ stalls.Given the variability of revenue recognition timing of several of our large partner agreements, we anticipate some sequential fluctuations in revenue, in particular on the eXtend revenue line. For the second quarter 2023, our network throughput is increasing compared to Q1, and we expect sequential revenue growth in our core charging business throughout 2023.With this, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Gabe Daoud.Gabriel J. DaoudCathy and Olga, I guess, was hoping we can maybe just revisit some of the comments around CapEx and how 1Q is not really representative of the quarterly run rate. So maybe, Olga, could you just help us understand how that trend's moving forward? And then also, what does that mean to 2024 saw this -- you're not prepaying for as much equipment this year given the step down in in capital?Olga ShevorenkovaYes. So that's a good question. Thanks so much, Gabe. So let me start from the start. We already paid roughly $70 million for 2023 assets last year. We just spent $60 million, a little over $60 million for the first quarter this year. Most equipment which were prepaid will be used for 2023 assets, some of that equipment will be used for 2024 assets. So there is a mix, obviously, heavily loaded towards 2023 usage, but there is a 2024 usage. So the CapEx, the quarterly CapEx is expected to go down. However, that does not mean that we will not be preparing for 2024. We will. We will start doing it in Q3 and Q4. And we will land the year with assets under construction and in line with our 2024 expectation. So we're not worried about that. And even, again, those are quite large amounts we already spent for 2023 assets, as you can judge by looking at first quarter and how much was spent on them last year. So it all makes sense for us. It all is positioning us for the optimal cash spend and the optimal start of 2024 in terms of targeted stalls in operation.Gabriel J. DaoudGot it. That's helpful. So then, again, I guess, the $164 million or so on the balance sheet, that's enough to get you through the 2024. Is that right?Olga ShevorenkovaThrough the majority of 2024, correct. So the same guidance we gave or the same notion we gave in our -- during our last call, that's enough cash to stretch through the majority of 2024.Gabriel J. DaoudOkay. Understood. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned, Cathy, the NEVI, maybe being a tail breeze and maybe being a bit slower than anticipated, but could you maybe just given some of the Buy America compliant issues around the hardware and can you maybe give us an update on where your suppliers are in that respect in terms of onshoring some U.S. production?Catherine ZoiYes. Thanks, Gabe. So well, look, our 2 suppliers that we talked about last time, the Delta and Signet, have factories underway and every indication is that they're supposed to be ahead and that's all going to plan. We should have more specificity for you probably by earnings call about the guidance. We're still waiting for some guidance from the Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway folks on certain of the Buy America provisions. We've also got again, Jonathan Levy, our public policy experts on the phone. Jonathan, did you want to add anything?Jonathan LevyI guess just that last point, Cathy, you were making, is that FHWA has indicated to a number of policy folks that they're getting a lot of questions about their Buy American guidance, and therefore they're planning on issuing an FAQ at some point soon. So we've been very engaged with folks in administration about the, kind of unintended consequences, as well as the practical realities of Buy America as currently done. As Cathy has noted in every forum, we've been working with our suppliers to the U.S. manufacturing for a long time, and so we're still working, you know, seriously with them. But in the meantime, there's some clarity that we're expecting to hopefully come soon from the federal government.OperatorAnd the next question comes from James West.James Carlyle WestSo Cathy, or Olga, what's the gating factor now in terms of your build-out of additional infrastructure, additional stalls? Is it capital? Is it the utilities? I know you don't want to be too far ahead of the, you know, of the vehicles arriving, but kind of what's the -- what are the, if you could push it harder and go faster, you know, what could hold you up from that or why would you not push it harder, I guess?Catherine ZoiSo just to your point about the utilities, the utilities are a -- they continue to be a near-term gating item, but it's almost like a predictable gating item now. So we had -- last quarter we had a couple hundred of waiting utility energization. And again, as I think I've said before, James, I mean, that's just a matter of time whether, like -- and some of them have been waiting for the utilities to show up to do the final inspection for 6 weeks, but they eventually will show up. So that's not a near-term gating item. I mean, we got a macro tailwind in the sector that is obviously pushing up into the right as we told you probably many, many times. We have identified thousands of perspective stalls that'll create [NTV] for us with our partners. One of the reasons I lean so far into our marquee partnerships at EVgo is that they continue to bring us good prospects. So over the next 5 years, yes, we could put more good capital to work, but at the moment, we've got a great plan to continue to build and go up into the right for '23, and we got the capital together through -- all of '23 and most of '24. So it's just really a question of how fast do we want to lean in to be kind of going at the right pace given the macro, the macros of the overall economy.James Carlyle WestOkay. Makes sense. And then I know you've been testing a lot of different pricing strategies over the last several quarters. I was curious how that's been going. I know, you know, lower pricing at off peak times, things like that. Could you maybe update us on how those plans are progressing? And kind of what you're seeing in terms of customer behavior?Olga ShevorenkovaYes. Sure. So what we're seeing is on the customer behavior, is a very strong affinity to our subscription plan. So we have 3 different tiers and continue to, kind of experiment, because the subscription plan usually doesn't just include actual subscription plus access to cheaper per kilowatt hour rate, but also some other perks like double amount of points or free reservations. So we continue to experiment with those bundles. But we see a very strong uptake on all 3 different subscription types we have. So that means subscriptions are here to stay and will be an essential part of our business going forward. And on, in terms of the time of use rate, we're clearly observing that our more customer sensitive segment -- sorry, more price sensitive customer segments such as rideshare, they're very, very reactive towards those signals, and we see how they're altering their behavior to show up at our network at cheaper times. However, when we're looking at kind of, like, daily commuters, we don't -- we see some response depending on locations, and then there is a wide range of maybe more affluent locations across the key cities where customers are just not as price sensitive as we originally thought. So all of our thesis remain true, and we continue to define those in our Chief Revenue Officer who joined us a few months ago, that's one of the main area of her focus to spend a lot of time on it. So we'll be updating the market as we learn more interesting insights from that.OperatorThe next question comes from [Doug Becker].Unidentified AnalystSo the record number of installations was highlighted during the quarter. You just addressed some of the gating items. Is it reasonable to assume installations increase each quarter over the course of the year, based on what you're seeing today?Catherine ZoiWe've got a plan for -- we've got a plan that is probably relatively stable over this year in terms of numbers that are going to go live. So the practical reality is that it always bounces around a bit. It's like the gating item of utilities, it's nearly impossible for us to predict which utility inspectors are going to show up in and which regions of America and which won't. So we've got a general plan. We know what, you know, we've got the target for the full year that we're confident of hitting, that might just bounce around a little bit as we go through the course of the year.Unidentified AnalystCompletely makes sense. And then the follow-up, kind of a pointed question, but consensus revenue is toward the high-end of the full-year guidance range. Is that reasonable based on everything you're seeing and particularly in light of your commentary on the NEVI program and just the volatility with the PFJ that you've alluded to previously?Olga ShevorenkovaYes. We won't be refining our range at this time. We guided the market only a few weeks ago during our Q4 call. Not much of our new information has come in since then, but we probably next time we speak, we will have a more refined strategy to inform the market on how the rest of the year will look like and everybody can judge vis-a-vis consensus. But at this time, we will remain committed to our wider range, kind of repeating all the reasons we explained last time in terms of BABA qualification, PFJ execution, and some still volatility on EV sales front. EV sales started off the year quite strong. We don't see any recession signs, but we're observing. We're still not even halfway through the year. So this time, we won't comment on a more narrow range of our guidance than we already gave.OperatorYour next question comes from Bill Peterson.William Chapman PetersonYou saw the EVgo team at ACT Expo last week and I'm sure you had a number of conversations with fleets, but I guess specifically, are the fleets really focusing on the eXtend offering or they more like your rideshare and autonomous vehicle partners that maybe prefer to use your own owned and operated network?Catherine ZoiYes. I'm going to toss that one to Jonathan. Jonathan?Jonathan LevyYes. It's a great question. But I think when we think about the eXtend offering, we typically think about it as a white label offering for retail, but you can think of the same kind of logic about the flexibility that EVgo has for our fleet offerings. You're very familiar with what we do with Uber and Lyft where they access our public network, but we also have the flexibility on where is it that we own chargers the customers operate, some of the customers use, sometimes the dedicated stations like we've been doing with the autonomous vehicle fleets. But most of the folks looking to electrify their depots in the fleet space, they're looking to own the charging themselves. And so, that is a little bit more like an analog to that eXtend business model. And I think some of that is driven by the incentive structures. A lot of the fleets doing early pilots are pursuing funding for those projects, which gives them an incentive to buy it, whereas we do know there are some others out there that will have more of an interest of more of a Charging-as-a-Service offering that EVgo also has where we retain ownership and the customers then can get more of a monthly fee model.So I hope that answers the question. The concept is there's different solutions for different fleets, but the majority of the depot fleet operators are looking to own that charging themselves at this point.Catherine ZoiI was just going to add, like, we've got a couple of contracts with the autonomous fleet guys, where they -- where we own the assets. So again, it's what we said, sort of continuously that we will meet the customers where they are as long as we can create a nice return profile for EVgo commensurate with the risk that we're taking. So and so far, you know, we can do the ala extend behind the fence with some fleets, and we can do the asset ownership model with others.William Chapman PetersonYes. Yes. That's exactly the question. Okay. That makes sense to me. Second question, so you talked about utilization and Los Angeles being the highest market. If you can give us a feel for where that is and maybe look in heaven, like, where would you want utilization to level out at? Would you prefer to drive it higher in LA, for example, or would you want to kind of keep awareness and just kind of add sites to kind of match the growth of cars in the market? Just trying to get a feel for how you -- especially around the pandemic where you would like the utilization to be ideally to not trade too much friction, but obviously give you the best return?Olga ShevorenkovaYes. So Los Angeles is, I mentioned that during my prepared remarks, it's a little over 14% for the Q1. It is one of our best performing markets. In terms of where we want utilization to be, over time, we think mid-term when we're underwrite assets, of course, we want it to be higher and we already observe high utilizations in certain pockets of our network, like, top 10% of our performance stall, consistently illustrate utilization, and access of 25%. So that's probably a good indicator where the overall network can go over time.Now when we think about near term, here our focus is on growing the network and growing the throughput on the network. There could be some near-term fluctuations in utilization, well, let's say there is a quarter when we build a little faster than this throughput has grown. Now that wasn't this particular quarter, but that quarter can happen. And that is okay with us. So in the near term when the network is still small and we're really focused on positioning for upcoming growth, you could see some fluctuations. Mid-term to long-term, we, of course, are very much focused on growing utilization and expect that all of the key markets will start showing high utilization levels in the next few years in a consistent basis.Catherine ZoiYes. And Bill, I just remind you that we have, like, in the early days of the NEVI Program, we had some charging stations out right in the Bay Area where you live, which had over 60% utilization because of rideshare drivers. Now that was a lot. But one of the reasons that we have pioneered both the innovative pricing schemes to sort of attract people to off peak hours and the reservations is if it that there is not a -- it's not as if we want to stop utilization at 20%, right? So what we want to do is enable the tech that you -- the assets to get used optimally by using technology to allow people to go when they want to go, be sure that a charger is going to be there.OperatorThe next question comes from Maheep Mandloi.Maheep MandloiCould we get some more details around the arrangement with Chevron and the eXtend business with that? I think most of the Chevron gas stations of the 8,000 are owned by small retailers. I just want to understand how would you, kind of or what would be the go-to market strategy there and any exclusivities on EV charges for that network?Catherine ZoiJonathan, why don't you do this, since you are involved in it?Jonathan LevyYes. Happy to. And thanks for the question, Maheep. I think the way to think about this to start is, this is a master service agreement with Chevron, right? So that puts us in the position of when those retailers want to do EV charging. We can be that first call, but there will need to be individual agreements executed with them on top of that. And additionally, you should think of it as an opportunity for Chevron and Texaco retailers to be either EVgo site host or be able to leverage EVgo eXtend. And that's actually a pretty sizable denominator then obligations that could add charging either directly through EVgo ownership, especially as we see the ones that are along NEVI corridors might be a really good fit for those public funding opportunities.Maheep MandloiGot it. And any thoughts on when we could expect the first deals with the retailers?Jonathan LevyI think it's going to depend on those individual retailers. And you rightfully pointed out that those are independent operators. And so as a result, those are going to be some subsequent conversations underneath this master site agreement that we're working together on.Catherine ZoiBut just to add a little bit of color, Maheep. It's one of those things that this Chevron -- the expansion of our Chevron relationship arose in part because of those franchisees are excited about the next frontier, which is providing fueling for EV. So it's not as if we need to go door knocking for and making cold calls to these gas station owners across America. They're excited about it.Jonathan LevyYes. That's a great point, Cathy. One of the things that I talk about is the fact that, you know, a couple of years ago, the National Association of Community Stores and the Fuel Institute were doing a lot of information gathering, but weren't very excited about EVs and now you can't go to any other conferences without it being mainly about the excitement about EVs, EV charging, the importance of accessing that demographic as a huge growth and valuable audience for them.Maheep MandloiRight. Then moving to the second question, there's some cash needs here. We saw an ATM issuance this quarter or in April rather. Just trying to understand how to think about that through the rest of the year given all the things you talked about, CapEx plans and prepayments and eXtend and maybe over here?Olga ShevorenkovaYes. We're using ATM opportunistically. Last quarter, we didn't raise that much as the trading window was quite short considering the 10-K filing happened a little later in the quarter. So -- and then we obviously limited on the use of ATM with the daily volumes. But again, we'll access it opportunistically. We'll access any other form of finance, you know, capital opportunistically as well. So I'll leave it at that, Maheep.OperatorThe next question comes from Alexander Vrabel.Alexander John VrabelCathy, Olga, I appreciate at the outset all the commentary about utilization and throughput and some of the drivers there. I'm curious just because to your point, Cathy, we're sort of in very early stages of Uber offering, Comfort Electric, and I think still, sort of coming out of the COVID era of people not doing rideshare in the first place. Where would you say we are, sort of in the stage of that piece of your, sort of network picking up? And also curious, I think Olga, you mentioned the acceptance rate on EVs driving higher revenue per stall or per charging session as well. We're definitely seeing that EVs can clearly take a lot more charge than they used to. Curious if you can unpack sort of those 2 drivers a little further and where you think we are in the process of those things ramping up?Catherine ZoiOn the Uber/Lyft stuff, we're absolutely in the early innings. I mean, both Uber and Lyft have committed to going all electric by 2030 in their fleets, and my goodness gracious they're -- Jonathan, do you happen to know what percentage is -- single-digit percentages that are EVs now with them? So it is very, very early days. So the fact that we've tripled, you know, year-on-year from this last quarter to the previous year, it's a great sign. I mean, the Uber and Lyft drivers charge 7x more and they need fast charging than a regular retail driver. So we're really, really excited about that one. Olga, why don't you take the second part?Jonathan LevyWell, I'm sorry. Before you do, the thing that I think is fascinating is the fact that Uber and Lyft both made that 2030 goal. And both of them right now, they're on pace to hit it by 2025. And I think you take that, you just suppose it with the regulatory drivers, especially in California for more 0 emission passenger miles traveled. And it's a great opportunity even though it is early days to continue to see growth in that segment.Olga ShevorenkovaYes. And on the charge rate, which you refer to acceptance rate, we refer to it as the charge rate. It's for everybody on the call, it's a pace with which the car can accept kilowatt hours flowing into its battery. That is increasing absolutely in line with our expectations. We're doing very detailed modeling, looking at all the upcoming models and projecting vehicle mixes, and then laying it with our network kind of trying to discern what charge rate we will be exhibiting, and we are definitely in line with what we were expecting, and we are pretty confident that number will continue to go up with new models being introduced into the market. And also, newer models becoming a majority of vehicles driving around kind of displacing the older vehicles which are much slower. So very great trend, and we'll continue to ride it at EVgo going forward.Alexander John VrabelGot it. Appreciate the color. One just quick housekeeping, I guess, you know, question for me. Just as far as the pipeline, I know that does tend to move around a little bit as far as the active development pipeline, but narrowed in this quarter versus last, I'm just curious if you can help us frame like exactly how that's defined, why it's narrowed in. I know some others were asking as far as your, sort of, hurdle rate or how you look at future investment and if that's at play, but just if you can help as far as why that moved in quarter-over-quarter?Olga ShevorenkovaYes. So our pipeline, everything which has high probability to be built, everything which is green lighted and a little bit before green lighted has high likelihood to be green lighted by our internal hurdles, is included into the pipeline. That pipeline is quite large as you could see, that's 3,500 stalls and that's on top of stalls and operation under construction. So all of those stalls are the stalls we need to develop over time. And right now, the focus is on execution and construction versus increasing the pipeline. We think the pipeline is very strong for the upcoming, you know, year or so. And that's why you'll probably not see as much of a pipeline growth versus you should expect to see more stalls going operational.OperatorNext question comes from Andres Sheppard.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerCongratulations on the quarter. A lot of my questions have been asked. Maybe I want to touch on liquidity for a second. So $164 million roughly in liquidity versus about $247 million in Q4 of last year. It's about an $80 million, I guess reduction in cash. I just want to better understand so, you know, funded through the majority of 2024, help me connect the dots. I mean, are we including the opportunistic ATMs throughout the year? Are we including NEVI funding in that assumption? I'm just trying to get a better understanding on it.Olga ShevorenkovaSure. So Q1 burn was roughly, a little over $80 million as you correctly pointed out. What I would like to emphasize that the operational burn was only $19 million, and the rest was what capital expenditure of $65 million. And that $65 million, as I already mentioned earlier in the call answering Gabe's question, that -- nearly half of it is equipment prepayment for the rest of 2023 equipment needs and actually some of the 2024 needs. So you should expect that capital expenditure number not to be -- the run rate for the rest of the year not to be in line with Q1, but actually to be lower. So that I think kind of will help you connect the dots a little bit. And on -- we do not include ATM as part of our cash plan, and that is, kind of cherry on the cake. It's on top. However, regarding the funding -- and when we talk about the funding, NEVI is only one of very many sources of funds, and EVgo is accessing. We've been in a grand game for many years now and been accessing municipal level grants and state grants for a while. We'll continue to do that. Specifically, NEVI, as Cathy mentioned in her remarks, we don't expect much of an inflow of NEVI funds this year. We'll probably see it next year, but we do expect a lot of other brand programs influence flowing in into the EVgo this year.And also, let me remind you that we have an agreement with General Motors where for every stall we put in operation, they pay roughly $33,000 to us, which they already did in both Q4 and Q1 and continue to do it as well. That's another cash inflow, which is available to us, and it's part of our cash plans.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerGot it. Okay. That's very helpful. So in other words, the cash burn should be significantly lower for the remaining of the year given that the majority, like you said, was on the CapEx side and that accounts for the majority of this year and some into next year. So the operational cash burn perhaps will be similar, but overall cash burn should be significantly less than what it was in Q1, if I understood that correctly?Olga ShevorenkovaCorrect. So and that's -- so let me just also clarify something. So the CapEx is roughly half-half on, now maybe a little 40%, 45% equipment, 40%, 45% equipment; 60%, 65% labor. So when I say that we prepaid most of the equipment, we haven't finished on the labor side. We need to put stalls in operations and so the labor cost kind of will continue, and we will also start doing some work in Q3 and Q4 on 2024 assets. So you'll definitely see some labor preparing. The rate will go down, but just to clarify, it's not that we won't have any CapEx spend, and we'll have some. It's just going to be much lower than what you saw in Q1.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerGot it. Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Maybe my last question. You know, regarding NEVI, I mean, it must be frustrating that we know by now the amount that each state has allocated over the, you know, per each year over the 5 years. I mean, is there anything that can be done to try to accelerate that process? I know it doesn't obviously rely on -- depend on you, but I mean, is there anything that can be done, you know, as an industry or individually to try to accelerate that process? You know, again, given that we have the numbers, it's just a matter of the actual bids being deployed, which sounds like 2024 will be the earliest. You know, just...Catherine ZoiJonathan, you want to take this, and we spent a lot of time on this. And as both, you know, Jonathan and I are former government officials in the prior lives, so we are familiar with the toing and froing, but maybe what would you say?Jonathan LevyYes. It's a good question, Andres. I think first of all, I don't want to give sure thrift to the states that have moved, right? There are a couple that have and we've submitted applications to a number of the states that have already opened, including some states that moved, you know, really promptly ahead. But you have to keep in mind that there isn't one NEVI program. There are these 50 individual NEVI corridor program. So each state gets to decide the specific parameters and the federal government was a bit delayed on finalizing their technical minimum standards, as well as the Buy America guidance, which meant that some states that may have otherwise been ready to go, they were then having to revise their plan or make other adjustments. And so, we're expecting more to come. So there are still some states that we think will make awards in 2023, but the question is, when do the projects go? You're on reimbursements for most of those types of programs. So the funding, as Cathy and Olga have said, we expect the bulk of that to be 2024 and beyond. So what we can do about it is continue to engage with them both directly on a state DOT level as well as through organizations like AASHTO, The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials organization. And that's what we and our policy team continue to do working both with the whole industry and directly to make sure that they have our best practices from Connect the Watts and other ways to know, here's a great way to run these programs.As Olga has said, we've been in the grant game for a long time, whether it's NEVI, the California grants that we announced last quarter or earlier this year rather, or the utility Make-Ready programs that are all important opportunities for funding. All of those will continue and the timing will be a little bit of an ongoing thing that we have to keep incorporating.Andres Juan Sheppard-SlingerCathy, Olga, Jonathan, congrats on the quarter again.OperatorAnd our final question will come from Brett Castelli.Brett CastelliJust curious in an update on the EVgo ReNew program and sort of upgrading those older 50 kilowatt chargers, kind of, where are we at in that process?Catherine ZoiYes. We've got -- the program is underway and we're going to be upgrading hundreds of them over the course of the year, and the program is on track. I mean, and what we're doing as well as we're actually integrating some communications efforts into EVgo ReNew so that -- what we've discovered is that sometimes the chargers are, I thought that sometimes there's an opportunity for driver education on how to actually make the charging work more effectively. So the program is becoming all-encompassing as I think I described last time. And it's on track, it's on track. We, you know, we've got a few hundred that we're going to be doing over the course of the year.Olga ShevorenkovaYes. And I would like to add that as of the end of the first quarter as a result of ReNew efforts and as a result of us continue to deploy high power charges, low 50s, for the first time were less than half of our network. So we could already clearly see in the numbers as well that the efforts bear the fruit.Brett CastelliOkay. And then any color and just in terms of, like, CapEx for this year associated with that program, just kind of ballpark?Olga ShevorenkovaWe do not give guidance on that number, but it should be higher, quite a bit higher than what we reported last year for that.OperatorAt this time, I will turn the call back over to Cathy Zoi, CEO, for closing remarks.Catherine ZoiWell, thanks everyone. Look, EVgo had a great first quarter 2023. Our strategy is showing the early proof points that it's working with throughput growing massively and it's exceeding EV VIO growth and our own stall growth. The outlook for EVgo and the opportunity for fast charging in the U.S. is getting better and it's faster. We believe our business is on a trajectory to scale rapidly and deliver really nice returns, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter about the progress. Thanks, everyone.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and PVH Corp. PVH boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

Solid first-quarter 2023 performance buoys optimism. However, forex woes and lower sales impede growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 3.8% against 25% decline of the industry and a 3.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $192.9 billion. The company projects a 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.28%.Let’s delve deeper.Q1 Upsides: Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter. The upside can be attributed to strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD successfully continued with its double-digit sales growth momentum for the last two years.Core Diagnostics Grow Strong: Excluding COVID-testing sales, organic sales growth was led by mid to high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the United States and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year. However, China is showing improved market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased nearly 8% globally in the first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbott successfully continued with the rollout of Alinity, the company’s innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across its platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testingStory continuesUpbeat Guidance: Abbott expects full-year adjusted earnings (excluding specified items of $1.25 per share) to be in the range of $4.30-$4.50. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36.Abbott projects 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, of at least high-single digits and COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies have been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Lower Sales: Abbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were affected by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. Within Diagnostics, as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decline in COVID testing sales compared with first quarter of 2022.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has been constant at $4.38.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting a 9.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.""Story continuesMedical devices, medical equipmentCopyright: nimon / 123RF Stock PhotoIntuitive Surgical, Inc.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on CSX’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for CSX What Is CSX Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11.60% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy CSX today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $28.69, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because CSX’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from CSX?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -0.7% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for CSX. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CSX seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CSX for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on CSX should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you want to dive deeper into CSX, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The firm primarily produces integrated circuits, power management products, and other microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).The company is based in Wilmington, MA, in the Boston metropolitan area. That gives it access to world-class talent and a hub of other resources. The company was founded by MIT graduates, and Analog Devices is also a founding partner of MIT.nano. MIT.nano includes a 214,000-square-foot facility dedicated to studying nanoscience and nanotechnology. In short, Analog Devices is one of the most connected firms in nanotechnology.Analog Devices primarily serves the industrial B2B end market. However, it has also carved out a strong presence in the automotive and communication sectors.It’s also a very profitable company with a strong commitment to its shareholders. It returns 100% of free cash flow to shareholders, redistributing $12 billion in capital over the last five years. So, it’s safe to say that Analog Devices will remain deeply connected to nanotech far into the future.Story continuesThermo Fisher (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is a promising nanotechnology stock, not because it produces novel nanotech. It doesn’t. Instead, Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the companies integral to studying nanotech and understanding its applicability to business.The company sells complex analytical products and software that allows researchers to understand nanoparticles. Without its products and services, nanotechnology breakthroughs become less-likely.The company is a broad servicer to the scientific community, and its products and services extend far beyond nanotech. It produces all kinds of testing equipment for the physical sciences. The company has certainly benefited from the pandemic, and the resulting boom in testing supply demand.That resulted in lower profits in the first quarter, down by 9% year-over-year. However, the company is keen to reward its investors even as sales slow down in the post-pandemic hangover. As a result, the company repurchased $3 billion of stock, while increasing its dividend by 17%. That makes it a compelling purchase with a reasonable narrative, despite slowing sales.Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is another semiconductor stock. It provides chip manufacturing equipment, software, and services to firms across the sector. In addition, the firm has deep expertise in technologies for modifying the properties of materials, including multiple highly-technical fields named here.Applied Materials’ Maydan Technology Center is a billion-dollar investment in leading-edge semiconductors. Its Materials Engineering Technology Accelerator (META) is another hub where leading nanotech is engineered and commercialized.The company approved a large buyback in March and increased its dividend from 26 to 32 cents. Over time, the most recent buyback authorization provides $10 billion in share repurchases. This authorization follows a $4.7 billion share buyback program launched in fiscal Q1. Applied Materials is promising, not only in terms of its technological prowess in nanotech, but also because its target price implies a strong upside for current buyers. Thus, Applied Materials remains one of the few providers in its particular space as well.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

MAR, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, ON Semiconductor Corp. ON and Triton International Ltd. TRTN.Top 5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Markets Show ResistanceThe U.S. equity markets showed immense resilience by breaking a four-day losing streak and returning to the growth trajectory last Friday, courtesy of a rebound in the regional banking sector and a strong earnings performance by Apple. The markets have been mostly on tenterhooks as investors remained worried about another financial banking crisis after the collapse of two other mid-sized banks, namely Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank to avert a similar banking catastrophe, the market sentiments largely trended down.However, the shares of regional banks shrugged off the pessimism and witnessed an uptrend to buoy the overall market swing. In addition, strong iPhone sales and key inroads in India and other emerging markets helped Apple to record solid quarterly earnings results. The latest data from Labor Department's job report further revealed that non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 in April compared with broad-based expectations of a rise of 180,000. Wages increased 4.4% year over year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.With improving job market conditions and softening inflationary pressures, investors largely expect the Fed to hold the interest rates in the near term. Moreover, the Fed indicated earlier that there might be just another hike in the current year depending on the macroeconomic factors, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they can benefit from ""cash cow"" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc., DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc., ON Semiconductor Corp. and Triton International Ltd. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

239,d394691b-6f3b-35dc-9be5-e283e23ef1ba,NWSA,2023-05-10,Those who invested in News (NASDAQ:NWSA) three years ago are up 65%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-news-nasdaq-nwsa-120301721.html,1683720181,STORY,['NWSA'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 19% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 60% in that time.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for News To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.News became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that News has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on News' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of News, it has a TSR of 65% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveNews shareholders are down 2.5% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 3.7%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for News   you should know about.Story continuesOf course News may not be the best stock to buy.

Vertical Bridge has agreed to construct these towers to-suit with Verizon as the anchor tenant. The towers will be held in an LLC formed by Vertical Bridge in which Verizon has a profits interest. The new towers will add to the overall communications infrastructure in the US, and will help to fulfill the need for new locations where towers do not exist today to continue to enhance the wireless experience.“Our new agreement with Vertical Bridge is an excellent alternative to the traditional tower leasing model. This cost-effective, sustainable and efficient model will allow us to accelerate our build program and provide additional services to customers,” said Lynn Cox, Chief Engineering Officer for Verizon. “We continue to focus on technology innovation and fast deployment to enable greater connectivity for our customers.”“This new model, designed to deliver value for both parties, is a demonstration of strong collaboration and mutual benefit between a carrier and a tower company to accelerate infrastructure development in the US,” said Ron Bizick, President and CEO, Vertical Bridge. “We are committed to rapidly building the infrastructure needed to drive the wireless telecommunications industry forward.”The comprehensive solution at scale provides an outstanding opportunity to deliver value and meet Verizon’s wireless infrastructure needs for years to come.Verizon Communications Inc.

But the experience was hardly a failure for Carlos, an eighth grader at Rubén Darío Middle School in Miami. ""What I learned is about the environment, the ecosystem-and that you need certain things to live in that ecosystem,"" Carlos says.Carlos designed his fish in Aurelia, an educational augmented reality app available (and free for all educators) on the Verizon Innovative Learning HQ portal. ""The Aurelia app goes over the features of fish, including size and shape, discussing adaptation across three different ecosystems in the ocean,"" says Roberto Padron, Verizon Innovative Learning Lab Mentor at Rubén Darío. The interactive application, he says, helps students learn how sea life adapts to its environment.Losing a first creation and starting from scratch is exactly the kind of life lesson that Padron hopes to teach in the school's Verizon Innovative Learning Lab, wrapped in a cross-curriculum lesson that teaches students both digital technology and marine biology. ""Getting it right the first time is fine, but it not being right is just as good, cause you're going to learn from what's happening,"" Padron reminds his students.With their tablets in hand, Padron's students wandered the classroom, enthusiastically exploring the deep-sea world they created through Aurelia. Unlike just reading in a textbook, these lessons jump off the screen, Padron says. ""The Aurelia app has such depth to it, yet it's simple. It just kind of constantly keeps catching their attention,"" he says. ""So for me, it's just a win-win.""His students agree. ""It's pretty fun,"" says Gabriella Herrera. ""So [the lesson] gets stuck in your mind, and you get smarter-but like, you're also having fun.""Story continuesAnd as for Carlos? With a few helpful tips from classmates, on his second try he created a bigger and badder fish.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+53.4% vs. +17.4%) reflecting the company solid portfolio of core drugs in diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others.Eli Lilly is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes and cancer drug Jaypirca already launched. Mounjaro sales are already benefiting from strong demand trends.However, the CRL for donanemab will probably delay the potential launch of the candidate. Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Verizon Communications have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past six months (+1.4% vs. -4.1%). The company is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. It plans to accelerate the availability of the 5G Ultra Wideband network with C-Band deployment, focusing on 5G mobility, nationwide broadband and mobile edge compute.Customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and continued network upgrades will likely augment its market position. However, its wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to stiff competitive pressures.It has reiterated its earlier soft guidance for 2023 due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The company is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks bode well for UPS. The company's strong free cash flow generating ability pleases us and supports its shareholder-friendly activities. Story continuesUPS anticipates making dividend payments of $5.4 billion apart from buying back shares worth $3 billion in 2023. However, United Parcel Service now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $97 billion. The new forecast is at the low end of the previous outlook and much lower than 2022's actual figure. According to the Zacks analyst estimate, it is currently pegged at $96.98 billion.The gloomy forecast is mainly due to weak consumer sales. Notably, average daily volume declined 5.4% in first-quarter 2023 at the U.S. Domestic package segment. The same declined 6.2% at the International Package division.(You can read the full research report on United Parcel Service here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Novartis AG (NVS), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) settled its fifth green bond offering of $1 billion, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated entirely toward renewable energy investments to accelerate the transition to greener electrical grids across the U.S. This follows Verizon’s announcement in February that the company fully allocated the net proceeds of its fourth green bond to renewable energy investments. Verizon has now issued five green bonds for a total of $5 billion since 2019.“I believe our actions speak louder than our words, and I am proud of the steps Verizon has taken towards our ambitious environmental and social impact goals,” said Tony Skiadas, Verizon’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. “As one of the largest corporate green bond issuers in the U.S., and as a leader in green finance and diversity in the capital markets with our Green Financing Framework, we are proud that our actions are contributing to greener power grids across the nation.”In 2021, Verizon deepened its commitment to fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in economic opportunities in the capital markets by including a pledge in its Green Financing Framework to only engage underwriters for its green bond transactions that have established clear and impactful commitments in support of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and/or are a diverse-owned firm or have a core mission of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Consistent with these criteria, the company is proud to partner with Wells Fargo Securities and four minority- and women-owned firms as lead underwriters for its fifth green bond: CastleOak Securities, L.P., Loop Capital Markets, Ramirez &amp; Co., Inc. and Siebert Williams Shank. The five firms shared equally in fees paid and responsibility for bringing this offering to the market.Story continuesThis capital market transaction aligns with Verizon’s long-standing commitment to drive both environmental and social progress as part of its responsible business plan, Citizen Verizon, empowering the technology leader to deliver on its mission to move the world forward by addressing pressing societal issues.Verizon Communications Inc.

246,f6c99eaf-6207-31cb-863d-89f9f8fcef33,VZ,2023-05-10,Investors in Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have unfortunately lost 22% over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-verizon-communications-nyse-vz-140022549.html,1683640822,STORY,['VZ'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 33% in three years, versus a market return of about 44%.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Although the share price is down over three years, Verizon Communications actually managed to grow EPS by 4.9% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's pretty reasonable to suspect the market was previously to bullish on the stock, and has since moderated expectations. But it's possible a look at other metrics will be enlightening.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. Revenue has been pretty flat over three years, so that isn't an obvious reason shareholders would sell. So it might be worth looking at how revenue growth over time, in greater detail.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Verizon Communications the TSR over the last 3 years was -22%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveVerizon Communications shareholders are down 17% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 4.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.2% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Verizon Communications .But note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Des Moines include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers in Des Moines have been quickly deploying 5G Ultra Wideband throughout the area. Currently, 70% of cell sites that serve the Des Moines area have 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of a new macro cell site in North Ankeny which serves the northern part of one of the fastest growing suburbs in the US around NW 118th Ave and NW 16th ST. Later this year, engineers will turn up new cell sites in Waukee, which is another fast growing suburb, as well as one between Ankeny and Des Moines. Customers in these areas will be able to experience the speed and security of 5G Ultra Wideband service with these new cell sites.In addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity.  5G using mMWave spectrum is available in Downtown and northern Des Moines, parts of Des Moines west, the suburbs of West Des Moines, Urbandale and Clive. Verizon engineers have just recently added two mmWave sites in the city of Clive.Des Moines’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers have been limited to using 100 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Des Moines will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Des Moines. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Des Moines area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Whether our customers are enjoying connecting with friends and family while on the move, connecting their smart homes through one of our home internet products or using our service in Des Moines for small business or enterprise applications, we know customers count on us,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team has been working hard in Des Moines to deliver these results, and we are not slowing down.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Des Moines, IA customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Des Moines, IA, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Des Moines, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but also is unbeaten in the categories of accessibility, reliability, speed, and data, text and call performance. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Des Moines with Verizon’s median download speed increasing a remarkable 288% and upload speeds increasing 50% since last year* in the market and peak download speeds of up to 537 Mbps.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Des Moines, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely.

In the first quarter, the fund outperformed the broader market and increased by 17.96% (Institutional Shares) compared to a 13.85% return for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and a 7.50% return for the S&amp;P 500 Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Baron Opportunity Fund highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On May 9, 2023, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $285.71 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 7.84%, and its shares gained 71.80% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $705.704 billion.Baron Opportunity Fund made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.""Story continuescaspar-camille-rubin-N_lrIeCWgw0-unsplashNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 17th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

But, Intel still believes it is on track to become worthy of getting back into the semiconductor game, and even competing with the big players, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).LayoffsWithout disclosing the exact number of job cuts, Intel only confirmed on May 9th it will be reducing its workforce across areas. Intel’s cost cutting strategy was said to be ‘working’ as the semiconductor giant expects to save about $3 billion this year and as much as $10 billion annually by 2025. As a sign of efficient cost controls and operations, Intel expects gross margin to expand to approximately 37.5% on a non-GAAP basis in the undergoing quarter.Quarterly HighlightsLayoffs are no surprise after massive 36% YoY drop in overall revenue that amounted to $11.7 billion, but still topped Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $11.04 billion.Intel made a net loss of $2.8 billion during its latest reported quarter. This translates to a loss of 66 cents per share which is a dramatic difference to last year’s comparable quarter when Intel made a net profit of $8.1 billion, or $1.98 per share. When the impact of inventory restructuring, change to employee stock options and other acquisition-related charge is excluded, earnings per share dropped a staggering 133% YoY but the adjusted loss per share of 4 cents was still better than what analysts had expected, which was 15 cents according to Refinitiv’s consensus.Revenue SegmentationsIntel’s strongest product line, chips that power desktop and laptop PCs, is struggling with the PC industry slump as it experienced a revenue drop of 38% on an annual basis.Story continuesThe server chip division which belongs to the Data Center and AI segment suffered an even more severe decline, as it slumped 39% to $3.7 billion.OutlookFor the second quarter, Intel expects sales of $12 billion to result in a loss of 4 cents per share, while Refinitiv consensus stands at revenue of $11.75 billion and 1 cent in earnings per share.All Hopes Are On The Upcoming iGPUDigital Trends reported that laptops powered by Intel’s Meteor Lake chips may not even need a discrete graphics card as the power of the integrated iGPU will be at the level of rival Nvidia’s GTX 1650 and possibly even Apple M2 chip but in a different way. To achieve victory across the board, Intel-based laptops need to come close to the battery life of the Apple MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip and graphics level of Nvidia GTX 1650 graphics. This is how Intel Meteor Lake chips could potentially empower Intel to compete with Apple and Nvidia. These promising chips are expected by end of the year, but only in laptops with the desktop range still remaining a concept.Turnaround StrategySince CEO Patrick Gelsinger took charge three years ago, Intel has been pursuing a turnaround plan to open up the company’s factories to make chips for other companies. Intel still hopes that it can manufacture more complex chips like its Taiwan peer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) that only manufactures chips for ""fabless"" chipmakers like Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) as well as Apple with which Intel also aims to compete for custom work, like the one of chips used in iPhones.  Interestingly, TSMC and Intel were not competitors throughout the majority of their histories but that changed when TSMC won the process race by manufacturing smaller and more power-efficient chips over the past six years. Also, while TSMC is also hit by the worst PC market slump in three decades, unlike Intel, it is facing a much milder blow because TSMC counts on ‘big fish’ clients Apple, Nvidia and AMD while also having a more diversified business. However, Intel's Gelsinger is confident of the company's turnaround and ability to contribute to the evolvement of semiconductor chips that will undoubtedly power the future.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Krishna added that the technology could complete simple tasks like shifting employees between departments.Still, the A.I. call-outs haven't necessarily meant positive stock returns. IBM shares are down since the Bloomberg story published, and PayPal stock fell more than 10% amid concerns over its outlook for margin growth.Mentions of “A.I.” are up 64% year-over-year in earnings calls, per Bank of America research, but the use cases often vary.There are companies, like Alphabet's Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), who plan to use A.I. as a product to sell to other businesses. Others are powering A.I. with services and hardware like Nvidia (NVDA), which has seen its stock rise nearly 100% amid the A.I. boom.A PayPal sign is seen at an office building in San Jose, California May 28, 2014.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Travelers Companies'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Travelers Companies How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Travelers Companies is:12% = US$2.8b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Travelers Companies' Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Travelers Companies seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.9% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Probably as a result of this, Travelers Companies was able to see a decent growth of 9.5% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Travelers Companies' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is TRV fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Travelers Companies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Travelers Companies has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Travelers Companies has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 24% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 15%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Travelers Companies' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

Lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems Inc., which sued Fox for defamation over claims about it rigging the 2020 presidential election, uncovered evidence that Carlson had insulted management, colleagues and guests. Fox settled the Dominion suit for a record $787.5 million.Carlson’s next move had become a topic of fascination in media circles. In recent days, Axios reported that Carlson and Twitter owner Elon Musk had discussed working together. Axios reported on Tuesday that a lawyer for Carlson sent Fox a letter accusing the network of fraud and breach of contract for leaking private messages to the media. The letter demanded documents that could lead to legal action.Representatives of Fox and Carlson declined to comment.Carlson’s announcement that he’ll be starting a new show on Twitter had ripple effects across the conservative media landscape. Shares of Rumble Inc., a conservative online video network, dropped as much as 14% in post-market trading.In the video, Carlson didn’t directly address his departure from Fox, but said “the best you can hope for in the news business at this point is the freedom to tell the fullest truth that you can, but there are always limits. And you know if you bump up against those limits often enough, you will be fired for it.”Carlson added that “there aren’t many platforms left that allow free speech. The last big one remaining in the world — the only one — is Twitter.”Story continuesAt the end of his video, the screen listed his website, TuckerCarlson.com, and invited viewers to text him.Twitter has become an increasingly hostile place for journalists and media companies since Musk took over. Reporters who covered Musk and the company have had their accounts suspended. NPR quit Twitter last month after Musk labeled its account “state-affiliated media,” along with those for the BBC, PBS and other publicly funded organizations.In tweet of his own on Tuesday, Musk said he hadn’t signed any deal, an apparent reference to Carlson.“On this platform, unlike the one-way street of broadcast, people are able to interact, critique and refute whatever he or anyone may say,” Musk said.(Updates with Musk comments in final paragraphs.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-ColaHow Normalizing Menopause Can Help Employers Retain Senior WomenVenezuela Brain Drain Enriches Panama and Other NeighborsAI Drug Discovery Is a $50 Billion Opportunity for Big PharmaYour Ad Data Is Now Powering Government Surveillance©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The company recently announcing that it's slashing its workforce and shutting down its news division. Now, this follows results from Fox, which reported a $50 million loss in the third quarter tied to expenses relating to its settlement with Dominion.With so much happening in the media world, we want to bring in ""Washington Post"" media reporter Elahe Izadi. Elahe, it's great to see you again here. So, of course, let's start with Fox because it's the first public comments that we've got in from Lachlan Murdoch since the settlement with Dominion, also since the firing of Tucker Carlson. What did you make of the results that we got today and what we heard from Murdoch?ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, a few things. One, Tucker Carlson was not mentioned by name. But it's notable that since he's been fired, the ratings for Fox News at his hour have dropped dramatically. And today, Lachlan Murdoch made no indication that they're going to divert or change their editorial strategy. It seemed to be, if you read between the lines, that Carlson's firing represented a tweaking of a strategy but that there would be no departure from what Fox has done for many years and for some time.The other thing that was notable was an acknowledgment that the settlement had a cost to the company and that, in this case, Lachlan Murdoch made mention that Fox was limited in what they could argue at trial and that he said something to the effect of we settled this to not drag this out.But the very notable thing to me is what was said about another lawsuit that Fox News is facing against another voting technology company called Smartmatic. That is a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit that we do not expect to go to trial, if it does make it to trial, until 2025.Story continuesAnd Lachlan Murdoch said something to the effect of, well, this case is fundamentally different. I'm not sure how different it is. We are going to see how that proceeds. But it is a different company. It's going to be a different state. It's going to unfold perhaps differently, but they're still a ways out.And then the other thing that's notable is that Fox also is facing several shareholder lawsuits for how the company handled the lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which ended with a settlement of $770-- $778.5 million, about half of what was there. But the company did incur a loss. The $50 million loss, net loss in this quarter, if you compare it to the same period last year, same period last year they posted over $200 million gain for that period.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Elahe, did you get a sense that Fox is just trying to leave all of these issues in the past because it didn't seem like they wanted to address the severity of the events that have taken place over the last several months pertaining specifically to the Dominion lawsuit, also to what we heard from Tucker Carlson, the decision to fire him. And then Smartmatic, it seemed like they almost just wanted to dismiss the risks that that would potentially pose here to shareholders given the sheer size of it.ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, I think the argument here and from when this news of the settlement came out and Fox put out a statement was that they want to put this behind them. They don't want this to drag on and that it serves in everyone's best interest to just end this matter and move on. They're still fighting in court over redactions being unveiled because there's still some things that we-- even though so much was made public during the Dominion legal fight through discovery that there were still some of these private internal communications that were redacted.And Fox has argued that a settlement took place precisely so that this matter could be ended and move on. And, yeah, I'm projecting a sense of the company is in good shape. Revenue did go up by 18%. It did post a loss, obviously, due to these legal fights but that the argument here is that it was in the best interests of the company financially going forward to settle and not to worry about the Smartmatic case.SEANA SMITH: Elahe, what's your sense of the sluggish ad market because there have been some hope that we would start to see a recovery? I think when you take a look at some of the tech giants that reported several weeks ago, they had shown some signs that things were improving. Yet when you take a look at some of these media companies, it doesn't seem like that's exactly translated here to some of the traditional media players. Is that in line with what you're seeing? And I guess, what does that tell us just about the next several months?ELAHE IZADI: In every memo about company-wide layoffs from digital startups to legacy media companies, there has made mention of a soft ad market and that this is something that media companies are still grappling with. I don't know if it's so much as the reality on the ground or concerns and to forecasting of what's around the corner and having to mitigate for that. And also, it's important to note that for a lot of companies, it's the ad market, but it's also audience numbers and that if the market-- if you have a lot of audience but the ad market is soft, it doesn't matter how many people are viewing your content if the ad market is soft. And so there's a calculation going into there.But, yes, I still think this is a concern at many media companies that the ad market is still soft and that ad revenue has gone down. During the pandemic, in the beginning, we did see a lot more audience numbers, that audience numbers went up for a lot of journalism and a lot of news content. The ad-- the ad market was soft. And I still think that there is this concern right now with uncertainty in the economy and I read in every single layoff memo that comes across my desk.SEANA SMITH: And when you take a look at some of the trends that are going on within the media space, a lot of these disruptors, it seems like, is having a hard time competing with the more traditional players within the media. Take a look at what's happening to Vice, the fact that BuzzFeed shut down its news division. What do you think this signals just about the future media landscape and what that's going to look like?ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, it's interesting if we look at specifically Vice and BuzzFeed. I would say they're in one of the earlier iterations of disruptors because a lot of the practices that especially BuzzFeed engaged in, outlets like ""The New York Times"" and ""The Washington Post"" started adopting those practices or poaching their reporters and doing listicles and that sort of thing. And that was in the 2010s. And I think in those cases what you saw was a lot of venture capital invested into-- and a lot of funding into these companies, and they couldn't expand fast enough to meet that investment.But at the same time, as we were seeing Vice probably heading into bankruptcy, BuzzFeed News shutting down and BuzzFeed trying to figure out how to get on firmer financial footing, we still see new digital media outlets getting into the space, raising capital. The Messenger is about to start with 150 employees. They already acquired another venture startup, Grid News, and shut that down.And so I always say whenever you have a space like media where there is a lot of volatility and people trying to figure out how to make this business model work or what can work, you're always going to have experimentation. And within that experimentation, there will be failures.SEANA SMITH: And as we were talking here in just the last couple of minutes, Tucker Carlson actually just tweeted out we're back and that he's taking his show to Twitter, reaching a deal with Elon Musk. What do you think of that?ELAHE IZADI: Yeah, I think they had some conversations, reportedly. And Twitter and Elon Musk, that's a whole other-- that's a whole other conversation, right, and how disruptive that can be. But, you know, in that, there is always this sort of existential question with Fox whether these really popular personalities on Fox are popular because they're on Fox or they bring viewers to Fox.Now, we see in the past week or two since Tucker Carlson has been fired and is no longer in that time slot, the ratings have dropped dramatically. Fox could promote a new personality in and put them and they could be successful in that time slot. And I think that's going to be something to watch. Will Tucker Carlson be able to get as much prominence, as much influence, and as many viewers on Twitter as he did on Fox? Who makes who powerful?SEANA SMITH: That is a very, very good point because we know in the past that that hasn't exactly happened, that Fox News viewers stay very loyal to Fox News rather than following the big personalities there. Elahe Izadi, thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.]"

But for now, we're just grateful to be here.”Carlson's announcement comes weeks after Twitter-owner Elon Musk sat for a two-part interview with Carlson on Fox News.Musk, who is CEO of Twitter and has referred to himself as a ""free speech absolutist,"" has said his goal is to make Twitter a digital town hall where users can share diverse viewpoints.""We have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever,"" Musk tweeted Tuesday. ""Tucker is subject to the same rules &amp; rewards of all content creators.""That includes subscription and a share of advertising revenue, Musk said, adding, ""Still working on the software needed for (the) latter.""Musk said he hopes that others, ""particularly from the left,"" would also choose to be content creators on Twitter.Axios reported that Carlson's lawyers sent a letter to Fox accusing it of fraud and breach of contract.Carlson's attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

Murdoch, who answered questions from financial analysts, was speaking in public for the first time since the case ended and Fox fired its most popular anchor, Tucker Carlson.Murdoch said viewers, and investors, should expect no change in direction from Fox News.“We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and multi-year appeal process, a decision clearly in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,” he said.Fox still believes it was properly exercising its First Amendment rights to report on newsworthy fraud allegations made by former President Donald Trump, even though that defense was shot down in a pre-trial court ruling in the Dominion case, Murdoch said.That's important, since Murdoch said Fox intends to use the same defense against a similar lawsuit by another elections technology company, Smartmatic. That case is not expected to go to trial until at least 2025, he said.Despite being asked directly about Carlson's exit, Murdoch didn't mention the former prime-time host's name and referred to his reign obliquely. Fox has not explained why it cut ties with Carlson.“There's no change in programming strategy at Fox News,” he said. “It's obviously a successful strategy. As always, we are adjusting our programming and our lineup and that's what we continue to do.”Story continuesAlthough hurt by the Carlson exit, Fox News remains the leading cable news network.Fox has lost viewers following Carlson's firing. Last week's substitute host, Lawrence Jones, reached between 1.28 million and 1.7 million last week in a time slot where Carlson usually drew around 3 million, the Nielsen company said.Yet Fox has gained more than 40 new advertisers in that hour, the network said, confirming a report in Variety. Advertisers like Gillette, Scott's Miracle Gro and Secret deodorant that had considered Carlson's show a toxic environment have signed on.]"

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Fox's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Fox How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:13% = US$1.5b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Fox's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Fox's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Fox's five year net income decline of 8.0% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Fox's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 8.0% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is FOXA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Fox Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 18% (or a retention ratio of 82%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.In addition, Fox has been paying dividends over a period of four years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is preferred by the management even though earnings have been in decline. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 21% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Fox's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Fox has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Littlefair.Story continuesAndrew J. LittlefairThank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Well, for the first quarter, the good news is that our underlying growth and fundamentals were strong. Bad news is our first quarter results were impacted by an anomaly and hopefully, a onetime occurrence, which was a historic spike in natural gas prices in California, resulting in a $10 million compression in our profits. A confluence of events, including unusually cold weather in California, the lack of natural gas storage capacity by the gas utilities and the El Paso pipeline that supplies 20% of the natural gas to California being out of commission. All contributed to cause the price of natural gas to spike as high as $50 an MMBtu here in California in January. The move from $7 an MMBtu in November to January was a 600% increase, translating into an increase in our costs at the pump from approximately $1 a diesel equivalent to $7.50. We did everything we could to mitigate this unprecedented chain of events that impacted the cost of our commodity. But California continues to be our biggest market by far, with the largest [transit] agencies in the state, dozens of refuse, truck fleets, airport vehicles and a growing number of heavy-duty trucks, all fueling at our network of 150 stations across the state. We passed along some of the increase in fuel cost to these customers, but we felt we can only do so much. Good news is that they understood in large part, because every household and business in California was also seeing their gas bills at least tripled, if not quadrupled during January. The other important point of this historic increase is that the price began to moderate in February, although there were still some balancing effects that we were feeling. The El Paso pipeline is back online and gas utilities have filed plans for additional storage. And as of March, the price of natural gas at the SoCal Citygate was back closer to $7 in MMBtu. Something else that has been impacting our bottom line and that we discussed in the last quarter's call is the price of the environmental credits. I know these are followed closely by many on this call. And as you know, there has been a nice turnaround in the California low carbon fuel credit price recently, about a 35% increase. But for the majority of Q1, prices were on the low end and had an impact on our adjusted EBITDA when compared to a year ago. By March, credit prices were in line with our plan, if not exceeding. In the first quarter, we sold over 53 million gallons of renewable natural gas, which was 34% more than we sold in the same quarter of last year. We won several large transit contracts, converted existing customers from traditional CNG more profitable RNG and opened additional RNG stations where Amazon heavy-duty trucks are the anchor customer. Our revenue for the quarter was $132 million, $48 million more than Q1 2022, but this was heavily impacted on the plus side by the commodity price in California that I just spoke about. By the time we got to March, we saw our overall business begin to right itself and track the plan that we had at the beginning of the year. Our balance sheet remains in very good shape with $220 million in cash and investments, addition to $132 million cash off balance sheet at our RNG supply joint ventures. As I spoke about last quarter, our first RNG supply project, Del Rio Dairy in Texas is now online. We now have 3 dairies in commissioning and 2 others in final construction. By summertime, we should have 6 projects producing RNG. Many of you have read about the tragic fire in South Fork Dairy in Texas, where we had plans to build an RNG digester. While we have funded some design, engineering and early equipment purchases for that project, we had not started on-site construction. And we are now working with the dairy owner as he plans to rebuild the barn and repopulate the herd. We will keep you updated on his progress. We've added expertise in construction, project management and origination to our RNG team that are keeping our projects moving along at a good pace. Not only clean energy and our customers remain bullish on this ultra-clean (inaudible), Washington knows the benefits of RNG as well. I hope you saw the announcement that a bill was introduced last month in the U.S. House representatives provide $1 per gallon tax credit for vehicles that use RNG. It's interesting to note that the bipartisan bill is being cosponsored by a Republican member from a rural district, [congressman] Brian Fitzpatrick. and a Democrat from our urban Southern California District (inaudible) Linda Sanchez. So members understand both the environmental benefits of RNG, which reduces air pollution and carbon emissions. And that the investment of tens of millions of dollars per new RNG digester benefits their agricultural communities. We believe a companion bill will soon be introduced in the Senate by another bipartisan coalition. 70% of all on-road fuel used in natural gas vehicles in 2022 in the U.S. was RNG, which is a great testament to its acceptance and the ease to transition it to existing fueling infrastructure and fleets. I think a tax credit will be a big boost to the adoption of RNG if it passes. We're also very excited about the rollout of the new Cummins 15-liter natural gas engine. It seems like a week doesn't go by that we don't hear some good -- some of the country's largest fleets like Wal-mart, Werner, NICE we are taking delivery of these preproduction 15-liter engines. I've spoken multiple times on these calls about the importance of this 15-liter engine to the heavy-duty truck market because it delivers the power, torque and economics the industry needs. And it's incredibly gratifying to see the early response. A few weeks ago, I was with the CEO of the largest trucking company in Canada and a customer of ours, [Murray Mullen]. And he is anxiously waiting the delivery of 2 test 15-liter engines in a few months. I've gone on a little long, and my goal is to keep my remarks shorter, giving us more time to get to your questions. But I do want to end by highlighting why I was in Canada, which was for a significant announcement with the largest natural gas company in Canada and 1 of the most successful energy companies in North America over the last couple of decades, Tourmaline. Mike Rose, Tourmaline's Founder and CEO, and I announced that the 2 companies are partnering to build a network of natural gas stations across Western Canada primarily targeting the heavy-duty truck market. We've identified locations for the first 4 with 1 already operating in Edmonton and have plans to eventually add 15 or so stations that will be co-owned by the 2 companies. Clean Energy will build and operate in the stations. We are very bullish about this new partnership with Tourmaline as well as our overall business. As I detailed at the top of my remarks, we experienced some headwinds at the beginning of the year, but the momentum has already shifted back. RNG continues to be a breakthrough fueling solution, allowing fleets to decarbonize quickly and affordably. No other company is better positioned for the RNG future with our expanding low-carbon supply and our growing fueling infrastructure. Thank you for your time today. And now I'll hand the call over to Bob.Robert M. VreelandThank you, Andrew and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start with giving a little color -- little more color around the $10 million drag on earnings in the first quarter from the high California natural gas prices. The quick math on that is that we have about 2 million gallons per month with exposure to natural gas price movement in the California market. And we saw an incremental price increase of around $6.50 a gallon. So that's an increase in our cost. We were able to increase our retail prices by $2 a gallon so taking our price at the pump to $7.99 a gallon versus diesel at the time was $5.99. So that left us about $4.50 a gallon that we absorbed plus we experienced some elevated gas utilities at our California LNG plant for about another $1 million impact. So disappointing when we really were having a nice quarter, but that is passed and frankly, without that anomaly, the quarter was really more in line with what we were expecting. Recent trends in the natural gas prices relative to oil remains healthy, meaning we have a strong economics at our retail pricing. LCFS credit pricing has increased into the mid-80s from the low 60s, which is where it was at on our last call. And even more recently, there's been a nice rise in RIN pricing. So the current economic landscape is good for us, and we think that we can recover much of the $10 million anomaly by the end of this year. Moving on and looking at volumes. We saw increases in volume across all of our core sectors with the largest gains coming from transit and trucking when compared to a year ago. The transit sector has seen more recovery this year, and we've also had some nice customer gains. And then our volumes with Amazon continued to increase, which is helping to drive the trucking sector growth. Both of these sectors, the transit and trucking contributed to the growth in fuel gallons, which was up 18% year-over-year. And then Transit also contributed to service gallon growth, which was 7% compared to the first quarter of 2022. We reported a GAAP operating loss of $35.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 on revenues of $132 million, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $20 million on $83 million in revenue a year ago first quarter. On the downside for the first quarter results of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, we have the $10 million drag from the California gas spike in 2023. Our increased volume with Amazon resulted in incremental Amazon warrant charges of $10 million in 2023. And our RIN and LCFS revenues combined were down $4.5 million from a year ago due to the lower credit prices. On the upside, in 2023, we have $4.3 million of incremental alternative fuel tax credit revenue compared to a year ago, as the alternative fuel tax credit was not in effect in the first quarter of 2022. Our adjusted EBITDA was negative $4 million for the first quarter of 2023, which includes the $10 million negative impact from the California gas prices. We've also, in our table in our press release, we've disclosed the EBITDA components of our RNG supply JVs, since we are operating 1 project, and we'll be operating more this year. Having said that our adjusted EBITDA of the negative $4 million breaks down as a negative $2.9 million coming from the distribution business and negative $1.1 million coming from our RNG supply business. And you can calculate these figures utilized in the press release and our 10-Q, but we intend to update our company presentation on this adjusted EBITDA to show you the 2 different contributors to the adjusted EBITDA. We're going to update our company presentation that we'll put on to our website soon. And with that, operator, please open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Stine with Craig Hallum.Eric Andrew StineSo thanks for the details on the RNG pipeline. Maybe if you could go beyond that a little bit. I know in the past, you've talked about kind of the next level, which is the number of plants that you've got in engineering phase. And I'd also love to hear just kind of the size of the pipeline as it stands now maybe versus 6 months ago, 12 months ago?Andrew J. LittlefairRight. So we slice -- Eric, thanks. We slice these things different ways. So when you kind of -- when you sort of boil all of it down, we have 9 under construction. Now 1 of those is South Fork. And I can go in a little more detail on that in a minute, but we have 9 under construction, we have 4 under engineering. In engineering these projects are pretty detailed, right? So it's -- you're spending some money at that point, and you're getting up to about 30% drawing. So they're well underway, and you have MOUs and everything. And then we have 2 kind of in the early stages of development. So they are about to enter engineering. So those are the projects, let's just call them active where you're really moving forward. Then the pipeline can kind of ebbs and flows, Eric. There are 18 to 20 active in the pipeline where we're dealing with the farmers and passing paper back and forth. And so now just to be clear, that number could probably [even swell]. I mean our guys are in touch with more than that. But that's the number that I asked for this morning, as we're kind of looking at those that we really are starting to get a real nice line of sight on. There are more. But time will tell over here over the next few months of kind of which ones then move into the real active pursuit. But the pipeline is robust and our guys have really done, I think, a nice job on not only on the [pipeline for] development, but also on the RNG supply side, which is very active for us as well.Eric Andrew StineGot it. And just curious, I guess, first of all, I mean I think in the past, you talked about an ultimate goal. I mean, obviously, you could expand beyond this with BP and total at some point, but I think targeting like 105 million gallons. Is that still a number we should think about?Andrew J. LittlefairYes, still. No, I'm glad you bring that up because it's still -- because we've kind of talked about it. We did acknowledge on the last call that some of these projects were taking a little bit longer and so there's a little slippage, if you will, to the right. But the main goal is still in place that's still what we laid out a little over a year ago of the 105 million, 100 million gallons of our own equity account with our partners on the supply side. That's still -- we're still on track for that. Now we've always been very clear that some of that will be greenfield that we'll develop some and it could be an M&amp;A. And so we'll still work on that. But we still like that number, frankly. I'd like to see that go up. But our partners are still looked with us on that. And then at the same time, and that's in development 2026. We have to then bring a lot more third-party, low CI gas and landfill gas to the equation as well. So we're very busy on that front. But we really haven't changed the size of what we're trying to achieve or the money that we're going to need to spend with our partners on it.Eric Andrew StineOkay. And then, I guess, maybe last 1 for me. Just I think last quarter, with the Amazon stations, you would -- not through anything that you were doing. It was more permitting delays, those sorts of things. Curious where that stands? Has that loosened up a little bit? And when you might get back to what you would view more of a normal rollout, if you're not (inaudible)Andrew J. LittlefairIt has. We worked really hard -- we have a very large team on the site acquisition, entitlement permitting, this side of the equation and then, of course, construction, right? And we've worked hand in glove with our friends at Amazon as well, our construction party and all of that team. Starting late last year to see what we could do to streamline the process and working together, utilizing all the levers that we have. I'm happy to note that we have 7 stations that are under construction right now, and that will come on in the next 5 months, and I reviewed that with Amazon the other day. And the entire -- maybe less 1 of the original stations that we signed on to Amazon that we've disclosed, will -- should be completed by the end of the year. So there's a lot more to be done there. It has sped up some. We get a little break with the weather, right? I mean we've made tremendous progress in a couple of stations out here in California, here in the last 6 weeks after the rain stopped. And that's also the case in other parts of the country. So I'm feeling good. We have cameras on all those locations. And we have meeting -- a standing meeting with a big team every Friday morning at 8:30, and a lot of activities we're bringing those projects along. So I'm feeling much better about that. And those are like magic, Eric. You opened 1 of those stations and literally within a few days, even before we were in final commissioning and ready to get the occupancy permit from a city, even those 158 trucks in there. And so it's a beautiful thing when you see it. And so we're very excited about.OperatorYour next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets.Robert Duncan BrownJust following on with Amazon, how many stations are now open? And do you have a sense of how [much] the truckload you're feeling at the moment?Andrew J. LittlefairWell, now you [remember], I always give this little warning and I get in trouble if I -- but I do know this. that we -- you know there's a couple of pieces to that, right? So we, early on, going back, I guess, what, 18 months ago, we -- as they began to take trucks, we opened up our nationwide network of stations. And as of the last week in my meeting with folks of executives Amazon reported that we've actually fueled heavy-duty trucks, Amazon trucks and mediums at 101 of our different stations. And that's a daily occurrence. And as of last week, it appears to us -- because it changes from time to time. You're approaching 1,500 trucks that are fueling on a daily basis. Now as those stations, that I just discussed with Eric come online, you'll see that number, I hope, go up. And I know that through the public information that Amazon's disclosed, I think they've admitted to 2,000 or 2,500 trucks that they've disclosed. And so our numbers should continue to go up as these stations come online.Robert Duncan BrownOkay. And then on the 15-liter rollout that they're testing right now, how does that ramp roll out? How do you sort of see that flowing into the fleet over the next 2 or 3 years?Andrew J. LittlefairIt was really pleasing to see -- I would like to say that Cummins has really gotten into this in a big way. And you may see it, Rob. But gosh, in the last 6 weeks, almost every week, there's another announcement coming out about different parts of the business. And last week, at the ACT Expo (inaudible) huge presence by Cummins, 1 of my salesman reported that he thought there was as many as 20 Cummins individuals there. Now they had a couple of other fuels, but about fully half of that (inaudible) was natural gas, portion of a lot of customer interest there. In fact, Rob, 1 of the only the ride and drive, big fuel cells and electric vehicles and all the showbiz of advanced technology and innovation there, the only vehicle that made it there under its own power to be in the right [hand] drive the heavy duty was the Cummins natural gas product that was driven in. It was actually being operated at the time by Wal-mart. Those vehicles, the way I understand it, and you might get better information from Cummins, but the way I understand it, there's about 40 some of the nation's largest fleets that are in line now to -- are kind of in sequence to take delivery of those vehicles. Those are new engines that are being placed into existing diesel OEMs, right, into trucks (inaudible) so they have to go to the shop from the fleet and put in the new engine. And some of -- those are on the road now, some of them -- some of those fleets I mentioned in my remarks. And I haven't seen anything official from Cummins, but the early reports are, the lady that drove the truck from Wal-mart had just a very good report that she imported there to the people at Expo. So I have my fingers crossed that the customer experience is going to be good. The torque and horsepower is good. I saw -- I think today, Cummins made another announcement on their upfitting program on their new design back-of-cab. And I really like this because you're beginning to see sort of the OEM nature that Cummins can bring now with their upfitting capability to bring the fuel system and everything together as a factory product. They've improved that. They have 170-gallon option, and I think 130-gallon options that really look slick.Robert M. VreelandIt's much lighter, 400 pounds lighter.Andrew J. LittlefairYes, that tank package -- thank you, Bob, it's 400 pounds lighter. So seems like things are going well, and I'm hoping I can never -- I always get out there a little bit ahead of myself. But the story is later this year, the kind of order book will open at some point. And I'm hoping that we begin to see those orders taken for that engine.OperatorYour next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS.Manav GuptaI actually quickly wanted to touch a little bit on the third-party volumes. Some of your upstream projects are delayed. Some of your competitors upstream projects are also slightly delayed. But in your guidance, you had indicated that you're still seeing very strong contractual volumes from third parties for both landfill and dairy RNG. Can you talk a little bit about your third-party volume contracts, as they relate to RNG and the volumes you actually distribute through your outlets?Andrew J. LittlefairSure. Bob, you (inaudible) those.(inaudible) handy here. But we -- the third party, I'll start, Manav, good to hear your voice. The third party is a very important piece to our story until we begin to -- well, it always will be, right? I think what the count is -- we have 63 different RNG suppliers. So we work with almost everybody in the business landfill and dairy. Our dairy is increasing dramatically this year that we're bringing in from third party. I think it's going from roughly in California from 20 million gallons of load of dairy RNG last year to something closer to $60 million for 2023. So a big nice increase. And we have what about 20% increase in third-party supply for 2023. That's right now on budget. So we'll end up with about 234, I think, million gallons for the year. And it's going well, Manav.Robert M. VreelandYes. Andrew, I agree. And I think -- I mean it ebbs and flows as we have always seen it, but it's not really being impacted by us seeing that projects are delayed kind of thing. But we -- because all of our third-party supply is pretty much operating units. And so anything that we come across there might be from an operational matter, where yield is a little different, but because we're kind of spread out with a number of the suppliers, then all that is anticipated. And we're planning on our 234 million gallons from third party for this year.Andrew J. LittlefairYes. So I think we're on track on that. So no, it's a good question. Are we seeing a slowdown? And no, I think we'll be able to meet our demand with our -- which is in large part due to our third-party supply.Manav GuptaCongrats on that. And a quick follow-up, and then I'll turn it over -- you mentioned in your opening comments, you are seeing some improvement in LCFS prices. There were meetings at (inaudible) they are looking to make some changes over there to support higher carbon prices. You guys obviously talk to them a lot more than we can. So help us understand a little better what's going on with carb and are they actually serious about making some changes, which will help support higher carbon prices in the future? And I'll turn it over after that.Andrew J. LittlefairOkay. Well, I would say, first off, we're in weekly or daily contact with different groups that -- at them as they look at adjustments to low carbon fuel standard program, which kind of the way it works, Manav, is there will be 1 more kind of community workshop at the end of this month -- end of May, first of June. then you should see some time, these things aren't set in stone right now, but it looks to us pretty closely that in June, July, you'll begin to -- then sometime in mid-June, you'll have a proposed rule out on adjustments to the low carbon fuel standard. And the Board will then begin to hear that some 30 days or so after. So sometime in late July, August, that will kind of move along. And of course, there'll be lots of input on that. I wouldn't say that the ARB is looking to make adjustments to raise the price and I don't know that they would agree with that. I Think they're looking to make some adjustments in the program to increase the compliance curve that is require more obligation by the obligated or compliance by the obligated parties to use more renewable fuel -- low-carbon fuels in the state that we're at about 20%. And so there's a couple of choices that's sitting before ARB, all of which are constructive for our business, we believe, biomethane business is 30%, increasing from 20% to 30% or 35%. And an awful lot of the industry and others have weighed in and we think the time is right to move to the 35%, and we believe that the industry is willing to spend the money. The private sector are willing to bring -- spend the money to be able to get to the 35% over time. So that's exciting. We think that will shake out. There are some other things that are kind of -- I would consider sort of some hurdles about where the supply could come from and how long you could go into certain -- how long could RNG go into certain markets. And we're making our views known on that if the ARB finally on this point, if the ARB moves to a 35% compliance level. You're going to need all the RNG you can get from all over the United States. And I hope that's where they'll land. And if so, that will, I think, positively impact prices. And I think, frankly, you're seeing the market begin to (inaudible) a little bit that there is going to be a higher obligation threshold. And I think that's why the prices moved from 60 to 85 -- 62 to 85. And it's likely it could move a little bit higher, even though it doesn't take effect for another year, right?OperatorYour next question comes from to Dushyant Ailani with Jefferies.Dushyant Ajit AilaniMy first 1 is on the Tourmaline contract. Could you kind of share some more color around the economics of the cadence of R&amp;D stations coming online over the next couple of years? Yes, just maybe some more color on that.Robert M. VreelandYes. Well, we have line of sight on 4. One is actually operating. And we'll get those -- we should get those constructed for the most part this year, maybe going into the first quarter of '24 on the other 3. And then -- but we've already identified probably 10 others in that market, and those will come on. So like our whole model is we got -- you have to go through a period to build them, it doesn't take that long. What we're most excited about there is the -- is our partner there Tourmaline, they're in this to drive adoption of natural gas heavy-duty trucks. They want natural gas heavy-duty trucks on the road up there in Canada. And as Andrew and I have been up there, the view is very bullish on that type of vehicle. They do need the 15 liter. So that also plays in. But the timing is good because if we had all the stations right now, we wouldn't probably have the vehicles. So we don't -- so we need to hurry up and get those built and then we're working -- the thing is with Tourmaline, they have so many operations. They see all of the various geographic areas where there's thousands of trucks going by locations each day. So we'll get about 4 in this year, early part of next year and just keep on going from there.Andrew J. LittlefairThe nice thing in Canada is you have a huge vast resource of natural gas and you have very expensive diesel. So you really have economics. This thing sits on its own bottom up there. And over time, you will parse in some RNG, but -- and everybody is open to that. And as you know, may know, there is a federal RNG low-carbon fuel program in Canada. It kind of kicks and phases in over time. It's -- I think it's already in, in D.C. But so everybody understands that you'll begin to blend in RNG later, but it will start out compressed natural gas and the economics of a [look good] as compared to diesel.Dushyant Ajit AilaniUnderstood. And then just a quick follow-up on that. In terms of permitting, how is that coming along? Are there any issues around that? Or is it relatively easier to get it versus what you've seen versus Amazon?Robert M. VreelandYes. I wouldn't say easy, but on the first 4, we're pretty well into those. And you always have it, but I do believe that these -- the areas are kind of heavy industrial. And so just -- I don't know that the permitting is going to be as prevalent as it is, is when we want to put something into San Bernardino.Dushyant Ajit AilaniUnderstood. And my final question, and then I'll turn it over. Just on Del Rio in terms of pathway approvals. How is that coming along? And then any kind of thoughts on the other facilities that are going to come on this summer. I think you talked about 6 flowing by summer. So just if you could share some color on the pathways approval for these.Andrew J. LittlefairYes. Pathways take longer. So you will begin to operate these things would come on production and then you'll put into storage, right? The pathways can take. We got to work on this. The industry, everybody is aware of it, the pathways in my humble opinion, take way too long right now, right? Pathways can be anywhere from 12 months to longer. You don't have to wait for the pathway, but you can't operate your full potential and you have to store some gas. It's under -- that pathway is underway, but that takes a while.Robert M. VreelandYes, because you have to run the dairy. You have to get a number of months of operation data that they collect and then establish the CI score. So all that is in the works, if you will. But that will take some time.OperatorYour next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairAndrew and Bob, could you talk about how the economics for dairy RNG will change in 2025 when the benefits of the IRA flow through? Should we expect that you would receive a PTC of approximately $80 per MMBtu in addition to the existing support from D2 RINs and LCFS programs.Robert M. VreelandWell, we'll get PTC at whatever, we hope it's $80, but it would be an addition, Matt, I mean, to your point, it's kind of on top of the economics that we've already -- that we've built in to justify the investment, it's additive for sure. And the big question is on how much. But we continue to hear that it could be substantial.Andrew J. LittlefairIt's graded on the carbon intensity of the fuel and that rule has to be promulgated by the Treasury Secretary. So that hasn't happened yet. So we don't want to count our chickens before they hatch, but we think it could be substantial (inaudible).Robert M. VreelandYes. And it's relevant in the marketplace. It's in the narrative for sure.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairSounds good. And then could you talk about what gives you confidence to keep the full year guide of $50 million to $60 million EBITDA. Are there any parts that are coming in better than expected that would offset the $10 million loss from High California natural gas prices in Q1?Robert M. VreelandYes. I mean we've -- now some of this has to stay. But look, when we set our plan and talked about our guidance, we said we're kind of going low on LCFS in the low 60s. That said right now, $85 million and if there's more encouraging news, that could go even more. So I think the LCFS is cooperating nicely. The RIN is cooperating nicely. And then just in general, kind of the underlying commodity economics at our stations before [they have] credits, we're at like a 30-plus spread between WTI crude and NYMEX okay? So you're at 70-something and $2.26. And when we see that, that just means that we're very competitive. We have a low-cost delivered product. That's against a relatively high-priced competitor in diesel. And that -- so that's good for us. So I like all that, moving forward, and we have enough of the year. You have about 9 months. So we feel like you can raise kind of our $10 million picky, if you will and stay with it.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairSounds good. And then last question. I think you have stations in Seattle and Tacoma in Washington State unveiled their LCFS program. Could you talk about how that's going and whether you're starting to receive like any sort of LCFS contribution from Washington so far?Andrew J. LittlefairWe do. We participate in the program in Oregon and Washington. I don't believe we collect anything yet in British Columbia, but I can't give you any more specifics than that.Robert M. VreelandIt's Not material yet.Andrew J. LittlefairIt's not material yet, but we'll try to get back to you on that, but I just don't know, it's not a lot. We have a few stations up there.Robert M. VreelandIt will grow. So it's going to -- it will be meaningful. It doesn't really [meet] the radar at the moment. But we see volume up there. We'll get it. Oregon a little less, but...Andrew J. LittlefairHigher pricing.Robert M. VreelandThey have great prices. So I mean it's more about the truck traffic and that sort of (inaudible). It's not anything that we're doing to not be there.Andrew J. LittlefairTrying to get that number, Matt. I'll try to get a number.OperatorYour next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.Paul ChengAndrew and Bob, just 2 questions. One, in Amazon, can you talk about the path to profitability on that joint venture. I don't think they are profitable yet? And what is the economy of scale that you need in order for you to really be profitable on there? And also that if we're looking at, there's a multiple avenue. I suppose that you can get to total corporation profitable over the next, say, by 2025, if the plan go through, what is the most critical path for the most important driver in your opinion for you to get to profitability?Robert M. VreelandOkay. Paul, on your first question on Amazon, let me see if I get this right -- on kind of Amazon profitability, if you will -- so I don't know that we've -- we haven't, I know I won't say I don't know. I'll say we have not discussed the economics on Amazon. So I'm curious -- I'd be curious as to maybe what you're looking at to say, when would Amazon be profitable or not. I think that certainly, what we -- certainly 1 of the things we see in our numbers is the Amazon warrant charge, okay? That is -- that's not an item that affects the kind of cash collected at the station in terms of when we transact on price per gallon and just what all is entailed relative to that. So there is that aspect to it. The -- so -- and the Amazon warrant charge will be here for a while as they consume the amount of spend that was targeted for them to earn the warrant.Paul ChengYes. No, maybe let me rephrase it. If I exclude the warrant charges, if your joint venture with Amazon today. You don't have to tell me the exact number, but can you share whether they are profitable?Robert M. VreelandWell, I'll say this. We are investing in building stations. And we have a model that would suggest that we need a fair return on investments. And so -- and it's fair. Look, all that's kind of negotiated, but understood that the commitment that we have with Amazon is good for both parties, okay? So we make -- we should be able to make money, and they should be able to get 1 of the best fuels at the lowest cost around with the RNG and all of that. And then the more they spend is based on volume, so that benefits us. So that whole program is good. And I'll say that it's beneficial.Andrew J. LittlefairI would add, I mean, Paul, it's not spec, right? We're not specking stations, hoping that an Amazon truck is going to show up, right? So there is a -- we are working hand in glove with Amazon, and we have a relationship to volume commitments for developing these stations, and that's beneficial for both companies.Robert M. VreelandThen on your other question in terms of overall corporate profitability, what's needed there to really kind of get over the line of, let's call it, positive net income, if you will. And ultimately, it's about volume and the adoption of heavy-duty fleets of natural gas vehicles. I mean that drives everything, all it really does. I mean, all the projects of RNG supply, and look, we -- so we're -- but we're bullish on that because -- well, I mean because it's kind of the epitome of renewable energy that's running our transportation fleet. So of course, we're -- but the -- and part of that -- the big part of that, Paul, is because for a while, we're already kind of built out to take on much more volume and so that can -- that would really kind of pop with us because we could already take on a lot of capacity without really expanding much more significant CapEx. And so that's really -- that's the play on it. And the big market that is just untapped literally is the Class 8 heavy-duty market. That's 40 billion-plus gallons a year. That predominantly uses the 15-liter engine.Paul ChengSo Bob or Andrew, do you think that, that path to profitability, the critical mass is like 80 million or 100 million-gallon sales? Or that what is that number in your opinion when you're looking at your internal model?Robert M. VreelandWell, good question. And there's a lot -- there's a little bit, but a lot under that, I mean, because as we go through, as we just talked about with our Amazon warrant charge and that sort of thing. But it won't -- I'll just say this, it's not a tremendous lift because you can kind of -- you can start to do the math and say, if you added 100 million more gallons that $0.45, $0.50 a gallon on a margin without expending a whole lot of other OpEx, you're putting in -- you're dropping in another $50 million that puts us on the positive side kind of things.OperatorYour next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.Craig Kenneth ShereWanted to just dig a little bit into the EBITDA ramp. First, for this year in terms of making up for the $10 million drag in mostly January, it sounds like pricing power and low gas prices that all things are many equal from here forward with LCFS and RINs, who knows that, that's just kind of a static situation where you have an opportunity. So if everything remains the same, as it is today, should we assume that making up that $10 million would be kind of ratably equal over the next 3 quarters, if it happened, versus rising over time? Or how do you see that progression?Robert M. VreelandWell, yes, it rises. I mean the progression -- our progression, as [I] said, it would be -- our progression would be somewhat similar to last year, which was -- it rises. But the reason it arises is because of volume. It's not rising because we're saying that is -- that LCFS is going to go [85, 90,110]. We're not kind of planning that to happen.Andrew J. LittlefairVolume ramp. It's the Amazon station volume ramp, other stations that come on. It's a volume ramp. And it's always -- and I know it frustrates some of you that want -- we should maybe -- and we're working on maybe a little more clarity quarter-over-quarter. But we've always had those of you that follow us while, we've always had a ramp that starts a little bit low in the first quarter and then ramps as they take trash trucks and we finish stations. And it's always the case, and it will be the case again this year.Craig Kenneth ShereI hear you. I'm sorry, maybe I didn't ask clearly. The ramp in terms of volumes was always a part of the plan. But the January dislocation was not and the very wide spread that you're enjoying between gas and diesel today is not. And so to the degree upside versus plan for the remainder of the year can make up for January. I guess what I'm trying to ask is -- assuming I have no idea what the future is. But assuming all things remain equal, is there -- there's no special reason to think that you're going to have a stronger upside versus plan in the fourth quarter than in the second. Is that a fair statement?Robert M. VreelandWell, I think we already answered and you said that wasn't the answer. It would be stronger because of the volume, but on a relative basis, you get there. I mean you're going to see the ramp and you're going to see kind of the -- while we didn't see really any benefit -- much of a benefit other than kind of in March and Q1, but certainly not at these kind of current prices. So all I can say is that do you have the same ramp, but yet better economics and what we planned, right, I mean...Craig Kenneth ShereSo therefore, as the volume goes up, that's impactful.Robert M. VreelandYes, it does. As you get more volume at better economics. But those -- the volumes, to your point, that's in the plan, that's fine. But what's not in the plan is kind of the LCFS and the RIN and as well as the spread that we're seeing on [oil] than nat gas. I mean those have profound effects. So if you just say, look, all else equal and lay in this new pricing, that's how you get there.Craig Kenneth ShereFair enough...Robert M. VreelandYou don't have to go through any big -- any other big hoops.Craig Kenneth ShereLet me pivot to the upstream. You announced kind of a breakout, which was nice of the 2 business lines in terms of the adjusted EBITDA. Assume the RNG supply is merely an issue of fixed overhead on a burgeoning business that obviously is moving towards breakeven and positive EBITDA. But you've got these delays that you alluded to on the pathway issues, could we reasonably expect your upstream business to be breakeven to positive by the first half of '24.Robert M. VreelandSure. Yes. I mean -- Yes. I mean there's ways that you -- yes, there's ways that you get there, which is by producing the gas and then there's economics on the gas, and that's what gets you a breakeven.Craig Kenneth ShereYes.Andrew J. LittlefairOperator, if I can just, Matthew Blair may be gone, but the answer was in Washington in Q1, we did a couple of million gallons and 50% of it was RNG.OperatorYour next question comes from Chris Sung with Webber Research.Unidentified AnalystAndrew and Bob, [hopping on for Greg]. I just wanted to just dig in on the previous question, EBITDA perhaps asking in a slightly different way. How did Q1 and Q2 so far compare to your internal expectations for last quarter? Like with negative margins, right, with the historic ramp in natural gas prices, like higher volumes kind of hurt your full year EBITDA guidance. So I was just wondering like was most of the $10 million hit. Was it just on pricing or mix of higher-than-expected volume for the quarter? And how does that fit into the rest of your full year guidance considering that you as you're keeping it unchanged?Robert M. VreelandYes. The $10 million was really on the cost of gas, okay? So you take that out and then our quarter was within our plan. All things considered, there's volume and other margins and just all throughout. So we were kind of -- we met our expectation other than $54 California gas. So right -- so we feel like, okay, well, that was there, but you have a $10 million hole that you've dug, what does the environment look like today? Look, if nothing had changed, I probably have to say there, I would say there's -- It'd be hard-pressed to say you're going to make up a $10 million hole, but things have gotten more positive than what we kind of laid out a couple of months ago in terms of what our assumptions were. So that's good for us. I mean the environment is -- that's a good environment. We're just disappointed that we had to absorb what went on, which was -- I mean, frankly, it was horrific. The checks that I was writing for gas bills was out of -- it was just unbelievable. And our customers, too. We had a whole campaign to contact our customers because we have a lot of kind of pass-through gas costs as part of the arrangement. And so we add customers that was going to get a bill from us that was 7x what they've seen in the past. And that adds ramifications all throughout. Are they going to be able to pay? I mean it was devastating to a lot of industry here in California.Andrew J. LittlefairRestaurants went out of business.Robert M. VreelandI mean we've seen some of the other groups in the alternative energy. Energy transition that kind of -- we're fairly well kind of blown away. A big part of their quarter was also this topic. So I feel like -- I feel like we financially, yet again, have weathered a significant storm. I was not -- that's not just a little talking point and okay, it costs us $10 million. It was -- that's a lot of money, and it was huge. And that's after we took prices up to nearly $8 a gallon compared to diesel at $5.99.Unidentified AnalystYes. No, right. And I kind of see it silver lining right, it's like the pricing (inaudible) with RNG. Sorry?Robert M. VreelandYes, with silver lining, I mean, I speak too highly of it because we've had a fair number of events that we've had to weather in the first quarter. But right now, the economics are good for us. And it looks good. I mean, the 15 liter, the excitement about that, Canada. It looks good looking forward.Unidentified AnalystGreat. And I'm trying to try to squeeze 1 more question in. I know we've asked about this in the past, and it's always good to kind of check in. Is there any updates on the rail or marine markets with respect to commercialization or timelines to commercialization for RNG and/or hydrogen via RNG?Robert M. VreelandOn the marine market?Andrew J. LittlefairOn the marine market. well, the only update I would say is that our second ship is being cooled down. It's not our ship. The second patient's ship is being cooled down in Brownsville at the end of this week and will then complete a sea trial and begin to move to the Port of Los Angeles. So that's nice every time those tips, there'll be 2 in service later here in the next month or so, and they use quarter million gallons of LNG on a round trip. So we like that. And the third ship should be here late 2023. No real -- Chris, I may be behind here, no real hydrogen or RNG going into shipping yet, not as far as we know, but we are putting LNG in a few ships and there are some other very large shipping lines that are out talking to us and others about more ships to be brought into the port.Unidentified AnalystNo, I appreciate the color. Thank you for that.OperatorYour next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.Jason Daniel GabelmanIt's Jason Gabelman from Cowen, but all my questions have actually been answered.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I turn the call over to Andrew Littlefair for closing remarks.Andrew J. LittlefairOperator, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Good afternoon.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.]"

PHM, Novartis NVS, Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD, Cummins CMI and W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy for Safe ReturnsWall Street is caught in feeble trading triggered by an uncertain Fed policy, growing geopolitical tensions and recession fears. This has compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing. In fact, applying some smart-beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — PulteGroup Inc., Novartis, Boyd Gaming Corp., Cummins and W.W. Grainger Inc. — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesAs a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:Atlanta-based PulteGroup is engaged in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.34 over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 15.6% over the past four quarters.PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B.

278,47c57b6b-e6ce-3e28-a7d0-1a50262b36fe,DIS,2023-05-10,"Disney board axed X-rated, liquor stores; forgot about jails",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-board-axed-x-rated-113514580.html,1683718514,STORY,['DIS'],"[ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Before allies of Gov. Ron DeSantis took over, Disney World's governing district, which at the time was controlled by Disney supporters, reached an agreement in February with the company to prohibit a long list of businesses from ever being operated on its property.Forbidden establishments included tattoo parlors, liquor stores, adult entertainment, oil refineries and trailer parks. But they didn't include prisons, which the Florida governor recently mused could be built there, when talking in a trolling tone about his yearlong feud with the entertainment giant.“What should we do with this land? And so, you know, it’s like, OK, kids — I mean, people have said, you know, maybe have another — maybe create a state park. Maybe try to do more amusement parks. Someone even said, like, maybe you need another state prison,” DeSantis said last month. “Who knows? I mean, I just think that the possibilities are endless.”The agreement, which the DeSantis allies say stripped them of power by giving Disney control of design and construction of the theme park resort, is at the center of dueling lawsuits between the DeSantis-appointed board and Disney, as well as a new law seeking to rescind the deal that the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature passed last week.Among the wide-ranging businesses prohibited by the agreement were establishments that sell X-rated items, gun stores or ranges, bowling alleys, hotels, lumberyards, massage parlors, head shops, nursing homes, marijuana dispensaries, doctors’ offices and anything taller than four stories.The board of the governing district, made up of DeSantis allies since March, met Wednesday to approve a new district administrator, hire the previous administrator as a special adviser and authorize a new method for enforcing codes or rules that could be used to fine Disney for violations.The new enforcement measure would let code officers issue citations for as much as $500 a day and appoint a magistrate to hear contested cases. It also would permit the placement of liens on property where violations exist and allow foreclosures on properties that have with unpaid liens.Story continuesThe new administrator, Glenton Gilzean, previously served as president and CEO of the Central Florida Urban League and will get a $400,000 salary in his new job. He said he was enthusiastic about efforts by the district to support affordable housing for Disney workers, many of whom struggle to make ends meet, and proposed a new study on the impact of the millions of tourists who visit Disney on the resources of surrounding communities.“My job is to make this district, and in turn, this entire region, a much better place,” Gilzean said.Disney and DeSantis have been engaged in a tug-of-war for more than a year that has engulfed the GOP governor in criticism as he prepares to launch an expected presidential bid in the coming weeks.The fight began last year after Disney, beset by significant pressure both internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law that bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over Disney World’s self-governing district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors that would oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with members of the previous oversight board that stripped the new supervisors of their authority when it comes to design and construction.Disney sued DeSantis and the five-member board two weeks ago, asking a federal judge to void the governor’s takeover of the theme park district, as well as the oversight board’s actions, on the grounds that they were violations of company’s free speech rights.The board sued Disney last week in state court in an effort to maintain its control of construction and design at Disney World. It claimed the agreements between the company and previous board members “reek of a backroom deal.”The creation of Disney’s self-governing district by the Florida Legislature was instrumental in the company’s decision in the 1960s to build near Orlando. The company had told the state at the time that it planned to build a futuristic city that would include a transit system and urban planning innovations, so the company needed autonomy in building and deciding how to use the land. The futuristic city never materialized and instead morphed into a second theme park that opened in 1982.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking in Washington, where lawmakers are holding high-stakes debt ceiling negotiations as a default deadline inches closer.1. U.S. inflation data dueSticky, elevated, stubborn. However you'd like to call it, higher-than-normal price growth in the U.S. looks set to remain in place for the time being.Economists predict that the consumer price index, due out today, will show that headline inflation in the world's largest economy held steady at 5% on an annualized basis in April. The core reading, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, is seen slowing slightly to 5.5% year-on-year - a level still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.The data will likely have an impact on expectations for the Fed's future interest rate decisions. The U.S. central bank has hinted that it may push pause on a year-long tightening campaign at its next meeting in June, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that it is ""prepared to do more"" if further policy restraint is necessary.2. Futures choppy ahead of CPI releaseU.S. stock futures pointed lower in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors await the unveiling of the monthly inflation data at 8:30 ET.At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down by 38 points or 0.11%, S&amp;P 500 futures traded 14 points or 0.14% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 31 points or 0.24%.All three of the indexes dipped in the prior session, with Wall Street's attention split between the CPI numbers and the ongoing political wrangling in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling (see below).3. Debt ceiling talksAlong with inflation, one of the most pressing issues facing the U.S. economy is the bitter fight playing out in Washington over raising the country's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.U.S. President Joe Biden held talks with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other lawmakers at the White House late on Tuesday, but were unable to forge an agreement. Both Biden and McCarthy, who are at odds over federal spending plans, came out of the meeting promising that their respective aides would stay in touch every day.Story continuesThe stakes could scarcely be higher. Lawmakers face a looming deadline to reach a deal to lift the debt limit or risk a potentially catastrophic default. Estimates vary on when exactly this so-called ""X-date"" lands, although it is widely expected to fall early next month.4. Disney headlines earnings batch""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3"" may have raked in $118.4 million in domestic ticket sales for Disney (NYSE:DIS) in its opening weekend, but the focus for many observers of the entertainment giant is on its performance away from the big screen.Analysts will be keen to get a sense of how Disney's traditional television offerings are faring as a broader economic slowdown threatens to weigh on advertising. Competitors like Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) already reported big drops in traditional TV ad revenues last week.Disney's streaming business will also be under scrutiny. Investors will be particularly eager to see progress in Chief Executive Robert Iger's sweeping restructuring of the company and how it is helping to make the service profitable.Other corporate names set to issue their latest earnings today include insurance group Manulife Financial Corp (NYSE:MFC) and fertilizer firm Nutrien (NYSE:NTR).5. Oil prices dropOil prices slipped on Wednesday, as traders braced for the U.S. inflation data and eyed a surprise jump in oil inventory levels.At 05:03 ET, U.S. crude futures were 1.52% lower at $72.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 1.47% to $76.30.A weekly estimate from the American Petroleum Institute, cited by Reuters, showed that U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly jumped by 3.618 million barrels in the week ended on May 5, rebounding from a decline of 3.939 in the prior week. The figure, which was previously forecast to dip during the period, has created fresh worries over demand in the U.S. - the world's largest oil consumer.Related ArticlesU.S. inflation looms, debt ceiling talks, Disney reports - what's moving marketsUS debt ceiling standoff talks look at COVID clawbacks, energy permitsUS credit crunch didn't start with SVB collapse, and may not end there]"
281,6826a6c8-f465-3204-8994-0015f08020f9,DIS,2023-05-10,Time to Buy Disney Stock as Earnings Approach?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-disney-stock-earnings-224410589.html,1683672250,STORY,['DIS'],"[One of the highlights of this week’s earnings lineup with be The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS) fiscal second-quarter results on Wednesday, May 10.Investors are wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +18% year to date to top the Nasdaq’s +16% and the S&amp;P 500’s +8%.Disney stock is still 19% from its 52-week highs seen last August and now is a good time to gauge if DIS shares are worth buying.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ2 PreviewDisney’s second-quarter earnings are projected at $0.88 per share, a -18% drop from Q2 2022 EPS of $1.08 a share. On the top line, Q2 sales are expected to be $21.73 billion, up 13% from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies.Notably, Disney easily surpassed its Q1 EPS expectations by 43% last quarter. The earings beat was driven by a 21% YoY increase in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment revenue at $8.7 billion. This led to shares of DIS spiking more than 5% before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks. Certainly, more sustainability in Disney’s price movement after reporting its Q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year’s rally can be extended.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIGER &amp; Cost CuttingIn regard to Disney increasing its margins, long-term CEO Bog Iger returned to the helm of the company last November with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability.During its last quarterly report and Iger’s first back as CEO, the Disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion. To the delight of investors, Iger stated the cost-cutting initiatives will make it possible for Disney’s board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; OutlookBased on Zacks estimates, Disney earnings are projected to jump 14% this year at $4.02 per share compared to EPS of $3.53 in 2022. More impressive, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to climb another 34% at $5.37 per share.Total sales are forecasted to be up 8% in FY23 and rise another 6% in FY24 to $95.43 billion. Notably, fiscal 2024 would represent 37% growth from pre-pandemic sales of $69.57 billion in 2019.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStreaming Growth Like streaming competitor Netflix (NFLX), Disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth. With that being said, Disney’s ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its Q2 results.Specifically, Wall Street is eyeing Disney+ after the streaming service lost 2.4 million subscribers during Q1 amid subscription price hikes. This was the firstly quarterly loss since Disney+ was launched in 2019. Still, a wider loss was expected among Disney+ subscribers last quarter with Disney topping estimates by 3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisney+ had 161.8 million paid subscribers during Q1 and 234.7 million total subscribers when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services. While Disney’s total paid subscribers topped Netflix’s 232.5 million paying members, the company’s Direct to Consumer segment reported a -$1.1 billion loss during Q1 up from -$0.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Disney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu although there were improved results at ESPN+. Direct to Consumer revenue did increase by 13% YoY during Q1 to $5.3 billion.  Improvement in operating costs among the Direct to Consumer segment will make Disney’s stock much more attractive. Longer-term investors are hoping that Disney’s growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company.Takeaway Disney stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) going into its fiscal second-quarter report. There could certainly be more upside in Disney stock from current levels but Q2 results will need to start reaffirming CEO Bob Iger’s initiative of cutting costs and sustaining growth and profitability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's my triple play today. A critical earnings report coming tomorrow for Bob Iger after the bell, especially as this company is currently facing a slew of challenges. Streaming losses are expected to continue to narrow in the quarter. That's one positive with consensus estimates calling for losses to narrow to $850 million after a loss of $1.1 billion in Q1 and a staggering $1.5 billion in Q4. Bob Iger has really stressed profitability, emphasizing the company is still on track to achieve streaming profitability by the year 2024.Then if we take a look at the park side of the business, that's expected to remain resilient. Operating income expected to hit $2.14 billion after soaring to over $3 billion in Q1. So slight deceleration, but analysts really bullish on the park side.That being said though, guys, as we head into this earnings report, there's a lot of challenges here when it comes to this ongoing legal battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, when it comes to the Hollywood writers strike. And then in the background, you have this macro uncertainty with a slowing ad market, as well as inflation still high. And that CPI print coming tomorrow will give us a clearer picture of how much prices have increased, but still.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly.- There's a lot going on.SEANA SMITH: [INAUDIBLE] impact that could potentially have on the consumer. You're right. There are so many unknowns when it comes to Disney. And I think a lot of this focus is going to be on the earnings call. You and I were on the last earnings call. And it was certainly, Bob Iger had a lot of energy. A lot of people were very encouraged by what he had to say.It will be interesting to see whether or not that tone is the same tomorrow. When we talk about Disney versus DeSantis, that has not really impacted shares yet. Whether or not that does down the line, that remains to be seen.Story continuesAnd then you're right, higher prices. The sheer cost of going to the parks, any of these parks is crazy. The fact that people are still going and at the rate they're going given the environment that we're in, that has really blow me away.- Well, you saw people were going to Six Flags though too. They had attendance down slightly, but they were making money. And that was a positive stock going back to yesterday. So and people seem bullish on Disney and the parks heading into this report. The other thing I'm watching tomorrow too is that signal out of ESPN in the earnings call.- Yeah.- Hopefully, in the release, we'll get a closer look at their numbers than we really have gotten before. And I'm interested to see what comes of that.SEANA SMITH: We certainly will see. That will be out tomorrow after the bell. Well,]"

Shares are falling after the company's full-year guidance for 2024. Revenue and earnings per share came in lower than Wall Street analysts had hoped. Under Armour calling its full year 2024 a year of building the brand where it expects revenue to remain flat to slightly up.Now, more on that brand building. New CEO Stephanie Linnartz noting on today's call, quote, ""we are not pulling in our fair share of market growth. I believe a casual factor here is the inconsistency of how Under Armour brand shows up across our regions with the most significant opportunity to improve in the United States and China."" I know we've talked about this before, how popular it seems like Under Armour used to be when you go back maybe a decade ago.And I'm curious to see-- they mentioned multiple athletes on the call, Steph Curry, who's had a very good playoffs right now. That's Under Armor star athlete. When you talk about building that brand, what are they able to do around a Steph Curry, Justin Jefferson, very popular receiver in the NFL? How do you make Under Armour cool again and more appealing in the US? Because it's not good when part of your earnings call is basically talking about how Under Armour isn't as cool as it could be in rebuilding that brand.- Yeah, which is always a bit surprising to me given the fact that they do have that partnership, the close ties with Steph Curry, that they haven't been able to capitalize on that more just given his sheer popularity. You talk about him being one of the most popular athletes that is still currently, certainly, in the NBA, but really across all professional sports. Why Under Armour hasn't been able to really profit more off of that has been a bit surprising.Story continuesBut they're exactly right-- they have been, certainly, at a disadvantage. They have not been able to compete or really keep up with so many of its competitors, namely Nike inventory. A massive issue here for this company. They have been forced to offer more discounts in order to just get some of their inventory off of the shelves. They need a clear catalyst.And right now, we have to point out the new CEO has only been in her job for a couple of months right now. But the turnaround picture, I think, is really what the Street is waiting for.- Yeah, that's a major question. If you take a look at Nike, it feels like they have so much momentum right now. We have the new Ben Affleck, Matt Damon movie coming out. People are just talking about that brand more than Under Armour. And talking about Steph Curry and these brands partnering with those personalities, we've seen that really work for a lot of these footwear companies-- Crocs, Post Malone. He made Crocs cool again. So it's trying to find that new face, perhaps, that could be at Under Armour. You would think Steph Curry would be it.- Well, I think the other thing, too, with Under Armour over the next couple of months is when you talk about a weakening consumer picture-- and Under Armour is already struggling to get sales-- Nike is probably going to be in a good position. People are going to keep buying Nikes. It's how do companies like Under Armour overcome what might be weakening consumer demand, I think, is an interesting story that's going to play out in retail next couple of months.- Yeah.]"

UAA delivered robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results as the top and bottom lines improved year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company provided guidance for fiscal 2024, which was lower than analyst expectations. This led to a fall of more than 6.1% in share price during pre-market session on May 9.Nevertheless, management remains enthusiastic about collaborating with Stephanie Linnartz to take its strategic consumer and product enhancements forward with its brand strength.Revenue &amp; Earnings PictureUnder Armour reported adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. The figure ascended from the adjusted loss of 1 cent a share reported in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,398.9 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,356 million and increased 8% on a year-over-year basis. The metric grew about 10% on a currency-neutral basis.The company’s wholesale revenues increased 10% year over year to $909 million, direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues inched up 3% to $454 million due to a 6% increase in e-commerce revenues, which represented 46% of the total DTC business.Under Armour, Inc.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses declined 4% to $572 million.The company’s operating income came in at $35 million. Under Armour’s operating loss came in at $46 million from the year-ago period, while the adjusted operating income was $11 million.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $712 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $674.5 million and total stockholders' equity of $1,998.4 million.

With this, the company repurchased 35 million shares for $425 million under its two-year $500-million program (which was approved in February 2022).FY24 GuidanceFor fiscal 2024, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, driven by supply chain tailwinds related to lower freight costs, partially offset by mix impacts related to higher off-price revenues and higher promotions expected in the company's DTC business.

The company's new CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, expressed optimism on the call. Take a listen.- I want this brand to win, to really win, by achieving the vision we all have for it. We are operating and executing with our eyes wide open. We know there is much work ahead of us and that we must move with urgency. Although fiscal '24 will be a year of building as we lay the groundwork aligned with our priorities, I am confident that we will achieve the growth and profitability that I know this brand is capable of over the long run.- Well, despite that earnings beat, Under Armour's stock down more than 4% after the company issued guidance below the analyst consensus as rising costs weighed on demand. Under Armour also said revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up slightly versus 2023. Under Armour's new CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, noted in a statement that she's prioritizing amplifying global brand heat, elevated design and products, as well as Under Armour's positioning in the US to drive growth.Well, joining us now to discuss is Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, David. So you were on that earnings call. Did you hear anything that really moved the needle on your price target of $15.50?DAVID SWARTZ: No, I don't think so. The outlook for next year, for fiscal year 2024, was quite disappointing. I was at $0.63 for the year, and Under Armour put out a forecast of $0.47 to $0.51, and that would be down from the last couple of years; earnings. So that was a bit of a disappointment. But the fourth quarter itself, the numbers were a little bit better than I expected. Revenue is slightly higher, and the EPS was a couple of cents higher.Story continuesSo I thought the fourth quarter was decent. It wasn't great. The gross margin was mediocre, but that's to be expected given the market conditions. But I don't see anything that really changes the long-term outlook for Under Armour or changes my fair-value estimate, which is $15.50, which is clearly considerably higher than the current stock price.- And so with that in mind, then, what is it going to take in terms of a growth story for Under Armour to get to that point?DAVID SWARTZ: I think we need to see more consistent top-line growth. And that's been the problem for Under Armour going back probably seven years now. And it's not likely to happen in the next fiscal year either. So as you mentioned, Under Armour just brought a new CEO, Stephanie Linnartz. This was her first appearance on an earnings call, the first time that analysts like me ever really heard from her at all.She laid out a vision on the call to improve, really, three major areas for Under Armour. That was product brand in North America. Under Armour has focused on those areas in the past, so that's nothing new, really. But maybe with a new CEO, there can be a renewed focus and some-- I think a better strategic direction.Because if you look at the last few years, Under Armour has really changed its direction multiple times. There has not been a consistent strategy, and that has really hurt the company. And the company has lost market share to other sportswear companies. So I think there needs to be more of a focus on, really, the areas of strength for Under Armor and, really, less of this never-ending change in direction.- And so to that point, then, how would you say perhaps Under Armour has any sort of competitive edge over, say, a Nike and Adidas?DAVID SWARTZ: The competitive edge that Under Armour has is that it's very much focused on professional athletes and hardcore athletes. They don't do a lot of athleisure stuff like leggings and casual sweatshirts and casual T-shirts. A lot of it is really focused on athletes who are wearing Under Armour while performing sports. The target market for Under Armour is athletes in the high school and college range, and that's an area where I think they do have credibility.I think they have an advantage there over some others, like Adidas, which is seen more of a lifestyle brand, and Nike, which is in everything. Nike is really broad-based. So I think that Under Armor's advantage is it's focus on real athletics. But there's been a lack of focus on that, too, in recent years because Under Armour has terminated a number of sponsorships of sports teams and colleges. And so you really wonder if they're sending the right message sometimes.- And I do want to ask you about something else that came up, which was the persistent inventory issues, which means some of these promotional pricing is going to have to continue for longer. Why do you think Under Armour hasn't worked those kinks out yet? Because a lot of other companies seem to have a better management of their inventory than Under Armour.DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah, the market has been difficult for a lot of companies, so I would give Under Armour a bit of a pass on that. A lot of companies did struggle to get their inventories under control last year, including Nike and Adidas. Adidas has been doing far worse than Under Armour recently, so it's been a very difficult market for a lot of companies in this industry. Under Armour, though, it just simply hasn't had the top-line growth. And so that's made it difficult for them to maintain to control the inventories.The inventories came in too high into the holiday season, then there were too high coming into calendar 2023. And that required a lot of discounting. But again, Under Armour was not the only one. And so we saw elevated inventories and discounting, really, across the industry. But unfortunately, Under Armour has not been able to overcome that to the degree that some others have.- Well, we'll take a look at that upside that could still be ahead in this turnaround story here for Under Armour. A big Thank you to David Wartz, Morningstar equity analyst. Thank you for joining us this morning.]"

This was an interesting one to track this morning. Shares of Under Armour sinking after demand took a hit from higher inflation, sending the retailer's annual sales forecast and profit outlook below expectations here. Shares are down by about 8%.And one thing stuck out to me-- and I would have loved to listen in on this earnings call, just to see the tone that was struck here. But one thing really stuck out, which was in the early comment that they provided, and saying, essentially, that this is going to be a year of rebuilding, essentially. And that is a theme that we've heard from some of the other tech companies, a year of efficiency.The only reason why I would say that this strikes me a little bit more in this, kind of, year of rebuilding and positioning for the brand here is because, you know, as we've just gotten through some of the NFL draft, for the sports fans out there, and Under Armour's got quite a few sports fans that they are trying to market into, when you hear a year of rebuilding, that strikes you as a, OK, things are going to be bad for a while, for a little bit here, as you're trying to turn the ship around.They mentioned in this call-- and they've got a new CEO that's at the helm-- that they need to prioritize the athlete more, and that, kind of, signals maybe where they got away from some of the performance element of the athlete and still were looking across where they could get into that, kind of, athleisure type of trend, that Lululemon, Nike, all of them, Adidas had invested heavily into. But for some of those other brands, they had continued to prioritize the performance side of that athletic landscape.And so, for Under Armour, getting back into that-- of course, a brand that has one of the greatest shooters of all time in the NBA, Steph Curry, under its brand for a huge contract-- it'd be interesting to see where they, kind of, leverage some of those insights from the athletes to build that on that next leg of growth.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: I mean, the bottom line here is they're not selling enough stuff.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: That's the bottom line. And they have too much inventory on hand. They're going to have to keep marking stuff down in order to clear that inventory. It's not a good position to be in. For whatever reason, whether it's the athletes, blah, blah, blah, that's the bottom line, and that's the crux of or one of their big problems, I would say.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.06%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this cloud services provider would post earnings of $1.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of 7.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Akamai Technologies , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $915.7 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.59%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $903.65 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Akamai Technologies shares have lost about 5.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.8%.What's Next for Akamai Technologies?While Akamai Technologies has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Akamai Technologies: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.34 on $920.3 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.47 on $3.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Services is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Zscaler (ZS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2023.

This charge primarily related to severance costs in connection with a workforce reduction to enable prioritization of investments in the fastest growing areas of the business. In addition, the Company continues to record facility-related charges as it reduces its real estate footprint due to its flexible workspace strategy.Supplemental cash information: Cash from operations for the first quarter of 2023 was $233 million, or 25% of revenue.

For example, stock-based compensation is unpredictable for Akamai's performance-based awards, which can fluctuate significantly based on current expectations of the future achievement of performance-based targets. Amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are all impacted by the timing and size of potential future actions, which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, Akamai excludes certain items that occur infrequently, which are also inherently difficult to predict and estimate. It is also difficult to predict the tax effect of the items we exclude and to estimate certain discrete tax items, such as the resolution of tax audits or changes to tax laws. As such, the costs that are being excluded from non-GAAP guidance are difficult to predict and a reconciliation or a range of results could lead to disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of the exclusions could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.*      See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitionsQuarterly Conference CallAkamai will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET that can be accessed through 1-833-634-5020 (or 1-412-902-4238 for international calls) and using passcode Akamai Technologies call.

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate Akamai's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP tax rate, capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below.Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Akamai's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate Akamai's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of Akamai's ongoing operating results.The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of Akamai's GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Akamai's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Akamai has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This reconciliation captioned ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" can be found on the Investor Relations section of Akamai's website.The non-GAAP adjustments, and Akamai's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Akamai has incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions Akamai has made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each acquisition; therefore, Akamai excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation – Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to Akamai's employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of Akamai's current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, Akamai believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of Akamai's core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate its performance and compare its operating results to peer companies.Acquisition-related costs – Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities, as well as certain additional compensation costs payable to employees acquired from the Linode acquisition if employed for a certain period of time. The additional compensation cost was initiated by and determined by the seller, and is in addition to normal levels of compensation, including retention programs, offered by Akamai. Acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and Akamai excludes acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect Akamai's core operations.Restructuring charge – Akamai has incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by the Company or the manner in which that business is conducted. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs. Akamai excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.Amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense – In August 2019, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%. In May 2018, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. The issuance costs of the convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from Akamai's non-GAAP results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.Gains and losses on investments – Akamai has recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. Akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of Akamai's core business operations and ongoing operating performance.Income and losses from equity method investment – Akamai records income or losses on its share of earnings and losses from its equity method investment. Akamai excludes such income and losses because it does not have direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of its core business operations.Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items – The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. Akamai believes that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows Akamai to highlight income attributable to its core operations.Akamai's definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures are outlined below:Non-GAAP income from operations – GAAP income from operations adjusted for the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized interest expense; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.Non-GAAP operating margin – Non-GAAP income from operations stated as a percentage of revenue.Non-GAAP net income – GAAP net income adjusted for the following tax-affected items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; amortization of debt issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses from equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.Non-GAAP tax rate – GAAP tax rate excluding the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items.Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, or EPS – Non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to Akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, the Company would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2027 and 2025, unless Akamai's weighted average stock price is greater than $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.Adjusted EBITDA – GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest and marketable securities income and losses; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses on equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.Adjusted EBITDA margin – Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.Capital expenditures, or capex, excluding stock-based compensation and interest expense – Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs presented on an accrual basis, which differs from the cash-basis presentation included in the statements of cash flows. The primary difference between the two is the change in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs accrued for, but not paid, at period end versus prior periods.Capex as a percentage of revenue – Capital expenditures, or capex, excluding stock-based compensation and interest expense, stated as a percentage of revenue.Impact of foreign currency exchange rate – Revenue and earnings from international operations have historically been an important contributor to Akamai's financial results. Consequently, Akamai's financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted.Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.Akamai Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform ActThis release and/or our quarterly earnings conference call scheduled for later today contain statements that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements about expected future financial performance, expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai.

The CyberRatings.org results noted that the SRX4600 Firewall achieved the highest rating of ""AAA"" for Threat Protection. Juniper blocked 99.94% of tested exploits and 100% of evasions without a single false positive.Story continuesGiven the sharp rise in application vulnerabilities and targeted exploits, a firewall that does not handle SSL/TLS effectively leaves traffic vulnerable to session intercepts, such as person-in-the-middle attacks. The SRX4600 received a ""AAA"" rating for SSL/TLS functionality, with CyberRatings.org noting that all tested cipher suites were supported for TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3. The SRX4600 also passed all additional encryption tests, including decryption validation and preventing insecure ciphers, including null and anonymous — or unsigned — ciphers.""Juniper is a leader in Network Firewalls.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Harmonic's first quarter 2023 financial results conference call. With me today are Patrick Harshman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeremy Rosenberg, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that in addition to the audio portion of the webcast, we've also provided slides for this webcast, which you may view by going to our webcast on our Investor Relations website. Now turning to slide 2; during this call, we will provide projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.Such statements are only current expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents Harmonic filed with the SEC, including our most recent 10-Q and 10-K reports and the forward-looking statements section of today's preliminary results press release. These documents identify important risk factors, which can cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. And please note that unless otherwise indicated, the financial metrics we provide you on this call are determined on a non-GAAP basis.These metrics, together with corresponding GAAP numbers and a reconciliation to GAAP are contained in today's press release, which we have posted on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. We will also discuss historical, financial and large statistical information regarding our business and operations. Some of this information is included in the press release. The remainder of the information will be available on a recorded version of this call or on our website.And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Harshman. Patrick?Story continuesPatrick J. HarshmanThanks, Scott, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter call. In the first quarter, Harmonic delivered another period of excellent results. Revenue was $157.6 million, EPS was $0.12 and adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%. Our Broadband segment revenue grew 23% year-over-year, and our radio SaaS revenue was up 72% for the same period, and both segments had booked a bill greater than 1. Strong demand for our products and services was further evidenced by strategic multiyear contracts signed for both CableOS and Video SaaS during the quarter. These new contracts, overall demand trends and the competitive success we're seeing gives us continued confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year 2023 and previously stated multiyear growth objectives.Taking next a closer look first at our Broadband segment; it was another excellent quarter characterized by strong financial growth, promising market development and expanding technology leadership. Segment revenue was $100.4 million, up 23% year-over-year. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21.5%, demonstrating consistently improving operating leverage. New customer wins brought the total number of broadband operators deploying our solution to 94, up 22% year-over-year. At quarter end, our CableOS deployments expanded to serve 18.4 million cable modems worldwide, still only approximately 10% of the global cable modem footprint.Looking ahead, we see expanding opportunity associated with both the remaining 90% of this global cable footprint for distributed DOCSIS 3.1 and follow-on investment waves associated with DOCSIS 4.0, fiber-to-the-home and network expansions. Breaking this down a little further, our 2023 growth expectations remain centered around our existing customers who continue to reaffirm and execute through advanced DOCSIS 3. and distributed access deployment plans across their networks. Looking a little further ahead, engagements with prospective new accounts are increasingly encouraging, aided by the visible success of our current customers and accelerating industry recognition of the unique market-leading benefits of our solution.Notably, during the quarter, we announced our partnership with Charter, and we're very excited to contribute to their new network evolution, footprint expansion and operational efficiency initiatives. We're also excited about the progress we continue to make with our new DOCSIS 4.0 and fiber solutions, important contributors to our multiyear growth plan. In the DOCSIS 4.0 area, our technology is out in front, and we're actively supporting our customers with advanced demonstrations and trials. In the fiber area, our unique cloud native vBNG and remote PON solution continues to gain traction with both new and existing customers. The new orders and sales pipeline are growing in line with our 2025 fiber growth target.I'll conclude this broadband update by reminding you of our overall 2025 financial targets, over $825 million in revenue and over 28% EBITDA margin. The combination of our existing customers have already begun multiyear deployment programs, new customers we expect to begin scaling in 2024, and our increasingly strong competitive position across both cable and fiber, all give us high confidence in delivering on these 2025 targets and building an even stronger broadband business that will drive profitable growth for years to come.Now turning now to our Video segment; here also, we delivered a solid quarter. First quarter segment revenue was $57.3 million. Although the top line was down, gross margin was 60.4%, up 160 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued shift to software, reduced low-margin server sales and especially continued SaaS transformation and growth. SaaS revenue was up over 72% year-over-year, exceeding 20% of total segment revenue for the first time. The strong streaming SaaS growth was primarily driven by existing media accounts expanding their live sports content rights and consumer reach, resulting in growing consumption of our services.A second significant highlight of the quarter was several new SaaS contracts with major media players that will begin to contribute recurring SaaS revenue in the coming periods. Among these were greater than $10 million expansion with an existing sports streaming customer and a greater than $20 million contract with a historically appliance-based broadcaster who's flipping the majority of their traditional operations to our SaaS. Associated with the April industry NAB event in Las Vegas, we recently made several announcements that highlight our growing leadership and success in live sports, streaming and dynamic service monetization.On the customer front, we announced very exciting relationships with Madison Square Garden, Bally's Interactive and VertiCast. On the technology and services front, we announced significant new SaaS technology advancements and ecosystem partnerships for dynamic ad insertion and fast channel creation. We're capping our video business strategy. We're focused on taking a leading position in the growing streaming SaaS market, particularly for live sports and maximizing profit from the traditional video [clients] market with a financial focus on recurring revenue, gross profit and EBITDA.The first quarter results were financial and strategic, demonstrate that we continue to make excellent progress towards these objectives. In fact, we're increasing our internal streaming SaaS forecast for 2023, and we remain highly confident in the 2025 business transformation, SaaS revenue growth and composite EBITDA targets we previously shared with you.With that, I'll now turn it over to you, Jeremy for further discussion of our financial results and our outlook.Jeremy RosenbergThanks, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. Before discussing our quarterly results as well as our outlook, we remind everyone that the financial results being referred to are provided on a non-GAAP basis. As Scott mentioned earlier, our Q1 press release and earnings presentation includes reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP that are discussed on this call. Both of these are available on our website. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results, highlighted by record first quarter revenue and solid operating profit.We ended the quarter with a solid balance sheet as well as record backlog and deferred revenue, positioning us well for continued growth in 2023 and into 2024. Before reviewing our Q1 2023 financials in more detail, let's briefly review the key highlights here on slide 7. For the quarter, we reported record revenue of $157.6 million, with EPS of $0.12, record bookings of $325.5 million and record backlog and deferred revenue of $623.5 million. Now let's review our first quarter financials in detail. Turning to slide 8; again, total Q1 revenue was $157.6 million, up 6.9% on a year-over-year basis.Looking first at our broadband segment, Q1 revenue was $100.4 million, up 4.5% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, reflecting continued current customer ramp-up and newer customer launches, including modest fiber revenue generated during the quarter. In our Video segment, we reported Q1 revenue of $57.3 million, down 16.1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Our video revenue included SaaS revenue of $11.6 million, up 72% from the prior year, which was ahead of our expectations. We had one customer representing greater than 10% of total revenue during the quarter with Comcast representing 47% of total revenue, which was similar to last quarter.Total company gross margin was 53.9% for Q1 '23, up 120 basis points sequentially and 660 basis points year-over-year, reflecting increased gross margins in both of our business segments. Broadband gross margin was 50.1% for Q1 '23, up 250 basis points sequentially and 1,210 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to a very favorable product and services mix and to a lesser extent, our strategic inventory investments to enable seafreight versus airfreight. Video segment gross margin was 60.4% in Q1 '23, up 50 basis points sequentially and 160 basis points year-over-year. This was primarily due to SaaS continuing to scale.Moving down the income statement on slide 9; Q1 '23 operating expenses were $66.2 million, up by 0.2% sequentially and 13.4% year-over-year. The increases were primarily due to increased research and development to support the growth of our broadband business and the ongoing strategic transition of the Video segment to SaaS. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 '23 was $21.4 million or 13.6% of revenue, up 48.3% versus Q1 '22, comprised of $21.6 million from broadband representing 21.5% of segment revenue and a loss of $0.2 million from video. This all translated into Q1 '23 EPS of $0.12 per share compared to $0.17 per share in Q4 '22 and $0.08 per share for Q1 '22.We ended the first quarter of 2023 with a calculated diluted weighted average share count of $117.8 million compared to $117.3 million in Q4 '22 and $110.6 million in Q1 '22. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the issuance of shares for settlement of the premium for convertible debt conversions upon maturity in December '22, and the issuance of shares to employees for vested restricted stock units, ESPP purchases and performance-based compensation. Turning now to the order book; we reported record bookings of $325.5 million.The book-to-bill ratio was 2.1% for the first quarter. For Q4 '22 and Q1 '22, our book-to-bill ratios were 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Q1 bookings include particularly strong multiyear SaaS bookings and new CableOS commitments. Over time, as supply chain conditions improve, we expect this ratio to normalize and approach the historical benchmark of modestly greater than 1. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10; we ended Q1 '23 with cash of $90.9 million compared to $89.6 million at the end of Q4 '22.The net $1.3 million sequential increase was due to a variety of factors, including improved DSO.We generated $6.3 million cash from operations, net of investing $10.5 million in inventory. Increased inventory has, by design, enabled us to meet strong demand for our products and to proactively manage our supply chain, enhance product availability and provide us with flexibility to use a higher proportion of ocean freight over airfreight, resulting in improved gross margin. As noted earlier, these investments helped drive the gross margin expansion we reported for the quarter. We also used $2.3 million of cash in the purchase of fixed assets.Turning to days sales outstanding; at the end of Q1 '23, DSO was 50 compared to 59 the previous quarter and 71 in the prior year period. Days inventory on hand was 163 days at the end of Q1 '23, up 16.4% compared to the end of Q4 '22 and up over 71.6% compared to the end of Q1 '22. The increase reflects our continued proactive investment in inventory as we prepare for growth during the rest of '23 and into 2024. Regarding capital allocation, our top priority remains driving our future growth. As such, we will continue to strategically invest in building inventory to meet the strong demand that we're seeing.We continue to enjoy considerable success by employing this strategy. However, if the supply chain situation improved substantially, as we've stated previously, we do have the flexibility to manage our working capital differently and generate additional cash by maintaining somewhat lower inventory levels. At the same time, our capital allocation strategy also takes into account our ability to return capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases. Again, as we stated previously, the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of Harmonic's common stock, market conditions, corporate needs and regulatory requirements.At the end of Q1, total backlog and deferred revenue was $623.5 million. This record backlog and deferred revenue reflects strong demand from our large broadband customers and growing video SaaS commitments. The majority of our backlog and deferred revenue has customer request dates for shipments of products and providing services within the next 12 months. Please note that we are now guiding to majority within 12 months rather than our historical 80% guide. This change also reflects the timing of some commitments with greater than 12 months with scheduling in process.In summary, operating cash flow was solid in Q1 '23, taking into consideration our stated capital allocation strategy, whereby we invested our free cash into inventory to meet the persistent demand we're seeing from our customers and to support our continued growth and managing freight. Let's now review our revised non-GAAP guidance for 2023, beginning on slide 11. For total company, for the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $705 million to $740 million, up $8 million at the midpoint from prior guidance; gross margin in the range of 50.9% to 51.9%, an increase versus prior guidance; operating expenses to range from $262 million to $271 million, a slight increase versus prior guidance; adjusted EBITDA to range from $108 million to $125 million, up $7 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance.An effective tax rate of 20%, up from 13% last year as we exhausted our NOLs in the past year. A weighted average diluted share count of approximately $118.1 million. Please note that the convertible debt-related dilution included in our share count uses the Q1 average stock price of $13.79. EPS to range from $0.63 to $0.74 per share, subject to the just mentioned dilution calculation, up $0.05 at the midpoint from previous guidance. And cash at the end of 2023 is expected to come in between 125 and $135 million.For total company for the second quarter of 2023 on slide 12, we expect revenue in the range of $161 million to $171 million. Gross margin in the range of 51.8% to 52.9%, operating expenses to range from $66 million to $68 million, adjusted EBITDA to range from $20 million to $25 million, an effective tax rate of 20%, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $117.8 million and EPS to range from $0.11 to $0.15 and cash to range from $90 million to $100 million. Turning to slide 13; for the full year 2023, based on our progress to-date and the latest customer information, we expect broadband to achieve revenue between $450 million to $470 million, which is $5 million above prior guidance at the midpoint.Gross margins between 46% to 47%, a 100 basis point improvement over previous guidance, given our expectations for software-hardware mix. Operating expenses between $123 million to $128 million, up slightly from our previous guidance based on supporting increased customer activity and adjusted EBITDA between $90 million to $99 million. For our Broadband segment, in Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $101 million to $106 million, gross margin in the range of 47% to 48%, operating expenses in the range of $31 million to $32 million and adjusted EBITDA to range from $18 million to $20 million.Now on slide 14, let's review the full year 2023 Video segment guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $255 million to $270 million, up $2.5 million at the midpoint from previous guidance; gross margins in the range of 59.5% to 60.5%; operating expenses in the range of $139 million to $143 million, down slightly and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $18 million to $26 million. For our Video segment, in Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $60 million to $65 million, gross margin in the range of 60% to 61%, operating expenses in the range of $35 million to $36 million and adjusted EBITDA to range from $2 million to $5 million.In summary, during the first quarter, we continue to execute our strategic plans and drive strong growth in our broadband segment while advancing the planned transformation of our Video segment. We ended the first quarter with record backlog and deferred revenue. We believe this and the strong demand we continue to see from both new and existing customers positions us well for the rest of 2023 and into 2024 as we continue to execute on our long-term business plan.Thank you, everyone, for your attention today. And now let's turn back to Patrick for final remarks before we open up the call for questions.Patrick J. HarshmanWell, thank you, Jeremy. In summary, we delivered another very strong quarter, characterized by excellent financial results, significant new contracts and important new customer relationships in both the broadband and video sides of the house. Our technology, our customer relationships and our team all continue to lead the markets we serve. We see great opportunity ahead and remain determined and confident in taking full advantage of these opportunities in 2023, '24 through '25 and beyond.Thank you for your continued support. And with that, let's now open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James.Simon Matthew LeopoldSo in March, you announced the Charter award, which we've all been keeping our fingers crossed waiting for. But what struck me was it specifically talks about the virtual CMTS products and does not discuss other products, such as the DAA nodes. Given the revenue forecast, I'm sort of assuming your intent is to sell them -- DAA nodes as well and not simply the CableOS head-end solutions. But if we could get a little bit more color on the composition of that project and the timing, I'd appreciate it.Patrick J. HarshmanWell, it's a little awkward Simon. It's -- we can't go there and talk in any specificity about any particular customer's plans. The communication that we agreed and that you saw with Charter was intended to really speak to the partnership around the broad portfolio with the capabilities that Harmonic brings to bear. Certainly, our virtualized core is essential to our solution and hence, the specific mention of that.I would say in any engagement that we're involved in worldwide, we see strong interest and opportunity around both the centralized core software as well as the hardware elements of the solution. And so without implying anything too specific about Charter, just kind of -- it's actually (inaudible) that we would pursue hardware-related business, with Charter just like we would within the other customer.Simon Matthew LeopoldAnd then just as a follow-up. The forecast for the Broadband segment suggests a pretty heavy back-end load to the year, given that the first half of the year is just a little over $200 million, and even your low end is $450 million for the full year. How should we think about that? Is it a very back-end loaded sort of 4Q or is the third quarter sort of somewhere in between the 3Q, 4Q guide? How do we think about it given sort of trying to figure out where that revenue is coming from and the timing?Patrick J. HarshmanYeah. Look, every one of our customers is actually still scaling. So the overall theme is continued growth. I'd stop short of saying it's linear but we expect Q3 to be up and we expect Q4 to be up on top of that. And that's based on the aggregate continuing deployment plans of our global customer base.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz of Needham &amp; Company.Ryan Boyer KoontzNice work on the gross margin there moving up and great bookings number, obviously. I wanted to ask -- I'm sure you're not going to respond so much quantatively but can you help us understand the software contribution there in terms of the quarter? Bookings, I assume with the shift in long-term deferred, there's a stronger software contribution there as well. Maybe shed some light on that would be helpful.Jeremy RosenbergRyan, Jeremy here. Thanks for the question. And in our results, we absolutely did get a strong software mix. And in our -- and that did push the margins up and that's, as you well appreciate sometimes the timing on how those things happen. We've really taken a systems approach to how we sell, as you know, as between software and hardware. So we are not breaking out software and hardware in the backlog, Ryan.Ryan Boyer KoontzSure, sure. Okay. And then maybe if you could reflect on the non-Comcast revenue. You've had just a tremendous run there. How should investors think about the scale of the non-Comcast revenue forward here in the guide? Do you think we'll start to see some meaningful growth there as we go through the year?Patrick J. HarshmanThe short answer is yes. Comcast is the largest cable operator in the planet, and they're also furthest ahead. So it's not surprising to see them out front. But in aggregate, the rest of the market is much larger. And our competitive position with the rest of the market is growing increasingly strong. So over time, while we're excited about the work we still have ahead of us with Comcast, the -- just the math of the rest of the markets is that the rest of the market will increasingly be a larger and larger portion of the business that we're seeing, we believe.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Frankel of Rosenblatt.Steven Bruce FrankelWith the theme from the last couple of questions going back to the last call, I think there was some color that you guys gave around the fact that there were three or four Tier 1s that were very early in their deployment phase, and you had anticipated that they would be scaling up between now and the -- between now and the end of the year. Is that still the case or did any of those customers' plans get pushed out?Patrick J. HarshmanIt's still the case. There's no material change in terms of the expectations or the forecast that we had for a bunch of them.Steven Bruce FrankelOkay. And you mentioned an interesting case in the video business, although legacy appliance customer switching to broadband. Maybe -- I'm sorry, switching to your cloud-based offerings in SaaS. Maybe walk us through the economics of that kind of transition? And do you think this is something that will become fairly commonplace in your customer base over the next couple of years?Patrick J. HarshmanSo I'll start with the end of the question. I mean the short answer is yes. I think that the -- from both a technology perspective and from an economics or business model perspective, I think that the broadcast market has been kind of very much on the learning curve, understanding how to harness cloud. But I think there's no question that it's not really a question of if, but when. The economics, both from a cost perspective as well as from a flexibility and innovation perspective, from a personalization perspective, it's -- there's overwhelming advantages that are, I think, increasingly understood by the market, Steve. So if you go back to the Analyst Day that we did in September, we talked about streaming sports is perhaps the largest opportunity, but we also highlighted conversion of traditional broadcast infrastructure is another significant SaaS opportunity. And it's great to see the first -- from our perspective, the first major domino there to fall, if you will in that regard.Steven Bruce FrankelGreat. And then lastly, maybe an update on the CFO search.Patrick J. HarshmanThe headline is it's going well. Jeremy has a big smile. Yeah. So we're fortunate. We're having discussions with a number of really excellent candidates. And I can't give you a specific date, but we're making good progress, and I think that we'll have a world-class CFO on board in the not-too-distant future.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tim Long of Barclays.Timothy Patrick LongTwo, if I could. First, on the video side, Patrick, can you talk a little bit more about kind of the SaaS wins you guys are getting? You mentioned live sports a few times, but can you talk a little bit about the complexion of those wins, how broad-based they are? Are these kind of competitive wins or is it folks maybe we're looking to do it themselves or just any color you can give us there? And then you also mentioned fiber-to-the-home going well according to plan. Can you just give us an update there on how your customers are looking at that portfolio and how you see the ramp going?Patrick J. HarshmanOkay. Thanks both good questions, Tim. On the SaaS front, really, it's all of the above. As I reflect on our -- perhaps our top 10 SaaS customers, they really come from all the categories we've previously spoken about. I would say, in general, they are all competitive with either our traditional competitors or, as you say, with in-house. One of our top three customers, for example, is the first time they've gone outside. They do their own VOD stuff themselves, which is a somewhat easier technical problem, but they turn to us for the live sports.Other recent wins were very much competitive situations with other peer companies, competitive companies like us who are providing a more turnkey cloud-based SaaS offering. And as we touched on a couple of moments ago, from another dimension, the customers also span media companies that are new to us, maybe new brands out there all the way to traditional brands that you and I know for the last 30 years that are changing their approach and their philosophy on infrastructure and moving from a traditional appliances to SaaS. So it's really all of the above. And it's -- we previously described it as a fragmented market.I'm impressed with the way our team is increasingly sales and marketing is getting after it, kind of covering the market from all different dimensions to get engaged with these myriad kinds of opportunities. On the fiber side, I think fiber is becoming increasingly relevant for all participants in the market. Home-based for us is really the cable operators and there is increasing competitive pressure in certain markets from fiber-based competitors. And having a fiber offering is part of the arsenal, particularly on what we call brownfield is -- seems increasingly important to the (inaudible) customer strategic plans. And our solution seems to be a perfect fit for that kind of application where we really layer on top of the CableOS cloud-native core and the already distributed gigabit access point (inaudible) called note.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux of Northland Capital Markets.Timothy Paul SavageauxAnd good afternoon, and congrats on the crazy bookings number. And I'll ask about that in a moment. But I wanted to touch on, I think, this maybe kind of a new metric you've given us here about your cable modems serve representing 10% of the global footprint, is that 10% of cable broadband subscribers globally? And I guess, historically, you talked about the footprint of your wins, which you added to substantially. I mean I assume that's up to 130 million now, so or something like that in terms of homes passed, but that's a different metric than the subscriber metric that you gave us. So I think in both cases, it suggests you're still pretty early on, whether it's 10% of the subscriber footprint or what looks to me to be 14% of your win -- homes passed. But how should we look at either or both of those metrics and kind of assessing where you are in the cycle? And I want to follow-up on that.Jeremy RosenbergTim, I'm going to pick this one up. Great question, as always. So if you go back to our Investor Day, I think we did talk about the size of the TAM, maybe not so much on the quarterly calls. And when we look outside of China, it's about 190 million households for high-speed data for our architecture. So that is a TAM reference for us. And to your question about how far along, I think, as Patrick laid out, we're at about the 10% mark for DOCSIS 3.1. And as we laid out in September, you have a DOCSIS 4.0 way that is coming up. And then you also have a fiber way and then multiple speeds of fiber from that. So we see ourselves still as very -- in very early exciting days here, Tim. And look forward to your follow-up question.Timothy Paul SavageauxWell, specifically with your largest customer, they had talked about basically being at a 20% kind of complete with the upgrade of the footprint by year-end and moving over 30% by the end of the year, this year, which seems like a long way to go, but does that represent -- is that similar to the cadence that you've seen, say, last year? Does that represent an acceleration or it seems with those type of metrics, obviously, Charter is trying to do this a lot faster. I guess we'll see about that. But it seems like you've still got a ways to go with Comcast in particular, even though they've been going for a while. Any color on that front would be appreciated.Patrick J. HarshmanLook, I mean I think we're fortunate, we're all fortunate that Comcast has been pretty open at recent industry conferences, etcetera, and talking about their progress and their plans. I think we don't really have anything more to add to that, but their plans, I think, really have laid out that they've talked about publicly, and laid out there, they're multiyear ambitions and both their continuing commitment to what they're doing and indeed to the fact that they're -- they still have a ways to go. So we're just fortunate to be along working with them as a partner, and we've been at it for several years, as you know, with them. And indeed, we see a pretty bright and exciting future around the current ways of technology and then coming ways of technology.Timothy Paul SavageauxGreat. If I could just sneak one more in quickly. I mean you seem to imply in your commentary that as was the case last quarter, your guidance for broadband for this year is overwhelming. I don't know what the right word is -- completely a function of your current customer base and that I would -- as well as the backlog commentary shifting from 80% to majority. I guess that you expect the big new orders that you got on the broadband side in Q1 to ship principally into '24. Is that fair to say?Patrick J. HarshmanAs we said, the backlog is still a majority within 12 months. It is important to remember that while there is much discussion about the supply chain improving, we are still in general, dealing with 12-month lead times and commitment requirements. And that's something that our customers are cognizant of and working with us on. So indeed, order activity right now, it doesn't need really to be more than 12 months, but it reflects, in general, a 12-month view, which indeed does bring us into 2024. I mean that's the first part of your question, yes. 2023, predominantly existing customers. We see new customers really all the time kind of coming on and slowly beginning to ramp. But with that caveat to 2023, the best way to think about it is predominantly existing customers, and we really see a material impact from new customers in 2024.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of George Notter of Jefferies.George Charles NotterI guess I wanted to -- if I go back to the conversation I think we had in the past, it was about how the sort of vendor ecosystem for optical nodes had kind of taken a step back, Cisco, of course, more or less exited the node market. And as a result, there was a period of time there where Harmonic was getting more share than you guys anticipated. And I know its diluting margins. But if I come back to the environment currently, where do you think you guys are in terms of node market share? Do you think you guys could have a third of the market, half, two-thirds? I mean what kind of share do you think is reasonable in general for the company?Patrick J. HarshmanWe believe, and it's consistent with, I think, it's the (inaudible) Group that tracks this. So we believe that let's focus specifically on the distribute and access nodes, George, which is where we -- sole area where we participate. We think we're in the neighborhood of about 70% of the DAA nodes that have been deployed to-date. Our multiyear or 2025 model that we presented at our Analyst Day envisions this percentage dropping somewhat, but perhaps closer to 50% maybe the 30% that we might have discussed with you, I don't know, a year or 18 months ago.So in short, we've been pleasantly surprised by the success that we've had. We've built a great product, and it's not just that it's tied to our cloud-native core from a power consumption, from a capability, from a throughput point of view, from being able to house both the DOCSIS and the fiber elements a number of reasons, our node turns out to be extraordinarily competitive. And we expect it will continue to be that way. Perhaps 70% market share is a bit lofty hence, our multiyear view that it comes down. But we're increasingly confident that we'll be able to maintain a very healthy market share.George Charles NotterGot it. That's great. And then as a follow-up I know from some of the metrics here, you guys have -- I think you said 18.4 million homes that are now connected to CableOS. When I look at the second derivative of those numbers quarter-to-quarter, it's down a chunk relative to what you put up in December. I think this quarter, you passed an additional -- connected an additional 3.2 million homes, I think, in December, that was 4.3 million homes. And so should I infer from that, that your CableOS revenue was down sequentially or should I not be kind of aligning revenue so tightly with homes connected as I think about you guys?Patrick J. HarshmanYeah. There's certainly a correlation over time. But quarter-to-quarter, a lot of different stuff happens in terms of shipment deployment, etcetera. And particularly in the first quarter where some geographies are affected by weather, George, I think I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. I do think that our full year guidance and then the multiyear guidance is really the best indicator of the overall trend that we see around the CableOS.OperatorI would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.Patrick J. HarshmanAll right. Well, thank you all again very much for joining us. We had a great first quarter. Second quarter is well underway, the rest of the year and the following years continue to look very positive. We're excited about our business, excited what we're doing, and we continue to appreciate your support. We look forward to our next opportunity to update to meet with you. Until then, have a good evening, everyone.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

(Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Coody, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Scott CoodyGood morning, and thank you to everyone for joining us on the call today. Last night, we issued an earnings release and presentation that cover our results for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Throughout the call today, we will make references to the earnings presentation to support prepared remarks, and these slides can be found on our website.Also joining me on the call today are Rick Muncrief, our President and CEO; Clay Gaspar, our Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Ritenour, our Chief Financial Officer and a few other members of our senior management team. Comments today will include plans, forecasts and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities Law. These comments are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please take note of the cautionary language and risk factors provided in our SEC filings and earnings materials.With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.Story continuesRichard E. MuncriefThank you, Scott. It's a pleasure to be here this morning. We appreciate everyone taking time to join us. For today's discussion, I'll be focusing on 3 key topics that I believe are most important to our shareholders at this point. First, I plan to cover our solid first quarter execution. Second, I will run through the steps we've taken to bolster the return of capital to shareholders. And third, I plan to share insights on how our business is positioned to effectively control costs and gain momentum throughout the rest of the year. So to start off, let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 6, where we had several key highlights. First, total oil production exceeded our midpoint guidance at 320,000 barrels per day, representing a growth rate of 11% compared to the year ago period. This level of oil production was the highest in our company's 52-year history. Our strong well productivity in the Delaware Basin was once again a key contributor to this result, and our recently-acquired assets, The Eagle Ford and Williston Basin also provided us higher volumes in the quarter. Clay will touch on our well productivity in greater detail later in the call, but I do want to highlight that the average well placed online in the quarter is on track to recover more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. These strong recoveries are right in line with our historic trends over the past few years, demonstrating the quality, depth and ability to deliver sustainable results across our resource base.Another notable achievement from the first quarter was our team's effective cost management. This was demonstrated by capital expenditures being in line with expectations and operating costs coming in better than our guidance by a few percent. I'll cover this topic in greater detail later in the call with our outlook, but this positive start to the year puts us in a great position to potentially spend fewer dollars in 2023 to achieve our capital objectives for the year.With our first quarter capital activity, we limited reinvestment rates to prudent levels resulting in over $665 million of free cash flow. This marks the 11th quarter in a row our business has generated free cash flow, with oil prices over this time ranging from as low as $40 a barrel to as high as $120 a barrel. This is a great example of Devon's ability to generate meaningful amounts of cash flow -- free cash flow across a variety of market conditions, further showcasing the durability of our strategic plan to create value through the cycle and deliver returns on capital employed that compete with any sector in the S&amp;P 500. With this free cash flow, we continue to reward shareholders through our cash return framework, which was well balanced between dividends and stock buybacks in the most recent quarter.As shown on Slide 7, the total cash payout from the shareholder-friendly initiatives reached an annualized rate of around a 12% yield in the first quarter, which significantly exceeds the available opportunities in other sectors of the market. Nearly half of this payout was derived from our distinctive fixed plus variable dividend framework. This consistent formulaic approach, which began almost 3 years ago, has allowed Devon to offer one of the highest yields the entire S&amp;P 500 since its groundbreaking implementation. Now turning to Slide 9. In addition to our strong dividend payout, we continue to see attractive value in repurchasing our shares, which we believe traded a significant discount to our intrinsic value. To capitalize on this compelling opportunity, we made substantial progress advancing our buyback program by repurchasing $692 million of shares year-to-date. In addition to our corporate buyback activity, multiple members of our management team, myself included, have also demonstrated their conviction in Devon's value proposition by purchasing stock in the open market over the past few months. With our Board of Directors approving the upsizing of the capacity of our repurchase program by 50%, up to $3 billion, the company is well equipped to be active buyers of our stock over the course of the year.Now moving to Slide 11. Looking to the remainder of 2023, there is no change to our disciplined operating plan we laid out for you earlier this year. Now that our Delaware infrastructure is fully operational and actively ramping to place more wells online, we expect our production to grow over the remainder of the year. This momentum places us right on track to average just over 650,000 BOE per day this year, which translates into a healthy production per share growth of approximately 9% on a year-over-year basis. With capital, we've not made any revisions to our outlook of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion for the year. As a reminder, this capital for cash assumes a low single-digit inflation rate compared to our 2022 exit rate. However, in the first quarter, we did experience service price stability for the first time in many quarters, and we began to see signs of increased availability of goods and services due to an overall slowdown in industry activity. If these trends continue, we see potential for downward pressure on service costs later this year and into 2024. With much of our contract book shifting towards shorter duration agreements, we're now well positioned to work with our service partners for better terms as more frequent contract refreshment occurs over the next several quarters.Lastly, on Slide 12, I believe this chart does a good job of summarizing the competitiveness of our outlook in 2023. With the plan we've laid out, we continue to possess one of the most capital-efficient programs in the entire industry that is self-funded at a $40 WTI oil price. With this disciplined plan, Devon is well positioned to continue to generate significant free cash flow and execute all aspects of our cash return model, making 2023 another successful year for us.Now with that, I will now turn the call over to Clay to cover our operational highlights. Clay?Clay M. GasparThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick touched on earlier, our team did a great job of meeting the first quarter operational targets through solid well productivity, effective cost management and the steady progression of upcoming development projects that will benefit us for -- over the coming quarters. Remember, we're focused not just on delivering the numbers for this quarter and year, but also derisking opportunities for the coming years and also investing in R&amp;D that will create value throughout the coming decade. We're making great progress on all 3 fronts. This positive start to the year put us in great position to continue to build momentum throughout the course of the year and achieve our corporate objectives for 2023.A significant contributor to the success in this quarter was our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin. As you can see on Slide 15, roughly 60% of our capital was deployed to this prolific basin, allowing us to run a consistent program of 16 rigs and 4 frac crews in the quarter. With this level of drilling and completion activity, we brought online 42 new wells in the quarter, with the majority of this activity targeting high-impact intervals in the Upper Wolfcamp. This focused development program resulted in another quarter of volume growth year-over-year, with oil representing 51% of the product mix.While we had great productivity across our acreage position, our performance during the quarter was headlined by our Exotic Cat Raider project. This 6-well pad located in Lea County, New Mexico, targeted a highly productive area with 3-mile laterals in the Upper Wolfcamp. Individual wells at Exotic Cat flowed at rates over 7,200 BOE per day and well -- per well recoveries from this pad are on track to exceed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent. The flow rate from this activity rank among the very best projects Devon has ever brought online in the basin. And lastly, on this slide, another key event for us during the quarter was the resumption of operations at our Stateline 8 compressor station. This was possible, thanks to the team's timely efforts in securing replacement equipment and the personnel to safely repair this critical facility. Although this repair work did temporarily limit our production in this part of the field during the quarter, we are confident that we resolved this issue and we do not expect any further disruptions of this nature. Furthermore, we also commenced operations at our Stateline 10 compressor station, providing us another 90 million cubic feet of throughput and even more flexibility in the region going forward.Turning to Slide 16. As I look ahead to the remainder of the year, our Delaware asset is well positioned to build upon the solid results we achieved in the first quarter. Overall, with the 200 wells that we plan to bring online this year in the Delaware, we expect well productivity to be very consistent with the high-quality wells we brought online over the past few years. And for context, as shown on the chart to the right, this level of well productivity would not only position Devon among the top operators in this world-class basin, but would also surpass the performance of other top shale plays in the U.S. by a noteworthy margin. This impressive well performance, coupled with a long runway, a high-value inventory, further underscores the competitive advantage and the sustainability of our resource base in the Delaware Basin.Turning to Slide 17. Another asset I'd like to spend some time on today is the Eagle Ford, which is our second-highest funded asset in 2023. Over the past few years, we've taken the disciplined and scientific approach to refine the next phase of development in this prolific field through thoughtful and measured appraisal work. The momentum generated from these learnings is evident in our current capital program, where we are pursuing tighter infill spacing and have active refrac program, with the goal to efficiently sustain a steady production profile and harvest significant free cash flow. This year, we plan to spud over 90 wells, with the majority of this drilling focused on redeveloping acreage with much tighter spacing than originally conceived when we first entered the play a decade ago. We attributed this infield opportunity to high reservoir pressure, a fractured network that heals quickly and low but consistent permeability. This unique combination allows us to pursue significantly tighter spacing, with redevelopment activity targeting 16 to 20 wells per unit across multiple landing zones in the Eagle Ford.In addition to the benefit of oil-weighted recoveries that are projected to exceed 0.5 million barrels per well, our ability to leverage this existing infrastructure in the play also bolsters the returns. These unique and favorable reservoir characteristics in the Eagle Ford provides us with many years of highly competitive drilling inventory.The team has also made steady progress on our refrac program in the Eagle Ford, achieving consistent, successful and restimulating the productivity of older wells. To date, we have roughly 30 refracs online that have successfully accessed untapped resource, resulting in an immediate uplift to the well productivity that has expanded per well reserves by more than 50%. In 2023, we plan to execute around 10 refracs and we've identified several hundred high-return candidates across the field to pursue in the future.While we have made significant progress on improving recoveries through infill spacing and refracs, we believe there's still meaningful resource upside in this play. A catalyst to help us accelerate our learnings in this area is our Zgabay pilot in DeWitt County, which is supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. The objective of this grant is to fund as field study and create an underground laboratory to improve the effectiveness of shale recoveries by testing new monitoring techniques for both initial stimulation and production as well as collecting critical data to enhance recoveries via refracking and EOR. While we're still in the early stages of gathering and interpreting the data from this project, we have already incorporated learnings into our day-to-day operations. These learnings will enable us to optimize recovery of resources, not only in the Eagle Ford but across our broader footprint in the U.S. I expect to have more positive updates on this topic in the future.And finally, on Slide 18, I'm also excited to talk about the positive results we're seeing delivered on other key assets across our portfolio. As you can see on the graphic to the right, over the past year, we've done some good work to opportunistically build up operating scale in these areas and increase the production by 9%. The main factors that drove this growth were our Dow JV partnership, which helped us regain operational momentum in the Anadarko Basin, the RimRock acquisition in the Williston and the quality assessment work we've done in the Niobrara oil play in the Powder River Basin. That has helped us build for the future. In addition to solid production growth, this diversified group of assets is on pace to generate a meaningful tranche of cash flow that we can deploy to other key strategic priorities such as the return of capital to shareholders. I appreciate the team's hard work and the effort that goes into delivering near-term free cash flow and also derisking valuable future inventory.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a financial review. Jeff?Jeffrey L. RitenourThanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today covering the key drivers of our first quarter financial results, and I'll also provide some insights into our outlook for the rest of the year. Beginning with production, our total volumes in the first quarter averaged 641,000 BOE per day. This performance exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter due to better-than-forecasted well performance across our asset portfolio. Looking ahead, our second quarter completion activity is weighted towards the back half of the period. As a result, we expect volumes to be relatively flat in the second quarter as compared to the first. However, given the cadence of activity, we do expect to build momentum throughout the second quarter, setting up the third quarter to be the highest production quarter for the year.On the capital front, we invested $988 million in the first quarter, which was in line with expectations. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect capital spending to remain essentially flat versus the prior period. As a reminder, we do expect to spend more capital in the first half of the year given the timing of completions in the Delaware Basin. This higher level investment in the first half of 2023 sets up Devon for a stronger production profile in the second half of the year. Moving to expenses. We did a good job controlling costs in the quarter with several of our expense categories coming in better than forecast. Looking ahead, as Rick touched on earlier, we're seeing cost pressures plateauing across our business, and with a solid start to the year, we feel very comfortable with our full year guidance ranges for operating cost and corporate expense. Jumping to income tax. After adjusting for nonrecurring items, cash taxes were 11% during the first quarter. This better-than-expected result was driven by an R&amp;D tax credit that was taken in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect our cash tax rate to step up to around 15% for the remainder of the year. Cutting to the bottom line, Devon's core earnings totaled $952 million or $1.46 per share. This level of earnings translated into operating cash flow of $1.7 billion. After funding our disciplined maintenance capital program, we generated $665 million of free cash flow in the quarter. With this free cash flow, our top priority was to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders. As we communicated in the past, the first call on our excess cash is the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend. Based on our strong first quarter financial performance, we declared a dividend of $0.72 per share. This distribution will be paid at the end of June and once again includes an $0.11 per share benefit from the divestiture contingency payments received earlier in the quarter.Another highlight for the quarter was the continued execution of our ongoing share repurchase program. We remain confident in the intrinsic value of our equity as evidenced by the repurchase of $692 million of our stock so far in 2023. With the Board expanding our share repurchase program to $3 billion, which is equivalent to 9% of our outstanding share count, we have plenty of runway to compound per share growth as we work our way through the year.Moving to the balance sheet. We exited the quarter with $3.9 billion of liquidity, consisting of $887 million of cash on hand and $3 billion of undrawn capacity on our unsecured credit facility. With this strong liquidity, Devon exited the quarter with a low net-to-debt EBITDA ratio of 0.6x, well below our mid-cycle leverage target of 1x or less. Looking ahead, we plan to further improve our balance sheet by retiring additional debt as maturities come due. Our next debt maturity comes due in August of this year, totaling $242 million. We'll have additional opportunities to pare down our debt with maturities coming due in 2024 and 2025 as well.As I look ahead, I'm confident that our financial framework provides us the necessary flexibility to effectively manage through the unpredictable fluctuations of commodity prices while optimizing value creation for our shareholders. With the business plan designed to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, we'll look to grow our fixed dividend over time, pay out as much as 50% of our excess cash flow via a variable dividend, opportunistically buy back shares and take additional steps to improve our financial strength. Furthermore, we possess the flexibility within this framework to lean in to any one of these options to maximize result for shareholders. We believe this balanced and transparent approach is differentiated versus peers. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.Richard E. MuncriefThank you, Jeff. Great job.I'd like to close today by reiterating a few key messages. Number one, our team did a superb job of meeting the operational targets we set out for ourselves in the first quarter through solid well productivity and effective cost management. Number two, our disciplined execution resulted in another strong financial performance for the company. This is evidenced by the attractive per share growth we're delivering, substantial cash returns realized by investors and the high returns seen on invested capital. Number three, with a solid start to the year, we're now on track to achieve all of our capital objectives in 2023. Inflation is showing signs of plateauing and our business is well positioned to build momentum and generate substantial free cash flow as we progress through the year. Number four, and lastly, we have the resource depth, execution capabilities, financial strength and disciplined business model to continue to deliver sustainable results through the cycle where a premier energy company are also perfectly positioned to benefit from this multiyear upcycle.And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Scott for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionScott CoodyThanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&amp;A.(Operator Instructions)With that, operator, we'll take our first question.OperatorOur first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaRick, you alluded in your comments that you might be tracking towards the lower end of the guidance as it relates to CapEx and costs. Can you talk about that? And is that a function of any early signs of cost -- service cost deflation as well?Richard E. MuncriefWell, Neil, I think we're watching a lot of things. We have seen a softening in the market, but I think as we've laid out in our guidance, there's really no change. We'll see how it plays out through the year. But as I alluded to, and then Clay had in his prepared remarks, we are seeing some softening and we'll just see on how that plays out. But I do see right now, no change.Neil Singhvi MehtaAnd then the follow-up is just around the Q2 guide, obviously strong Q1 results. Q2 oil guide was a little bit below consensus. Is that just timing of completion and activity? And just anything you could say around the cadence of volumes over the course of the year?Richard E. MuncriefYes. It is strictly time. And I'll have Clay weigh in, also more color, Neil.Clay M. GasparYes. Neil, just think of the -- our band, as we try and pursue flat production, is somewhere in that 320, maybe 330 right -- or excuse me 320 to 330, excuse me, that band in there. And I think the second quarter is going to be on the low end as we expect that third quarter to be on the high end of that range. But no, our original guide, that's still very much intact and we feel good about it. As you start really dialing in, I mean, the plus or minus 1% of our numbers, it's definitely affected by timing. You bring that big pad on early in the quarter, later in the quarter. We've got some other things going. We're a little front-end loaded on the capital with that fourth frac crew. So you'll see that kind of peel off. That affects kind of the very tail end of the year, but we'll see the biggest quarter of the year in the third quarter.OperatorOur next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.Arun JayaramClay, maybe for you. I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the integration of the RimRock and the latest assets, we've seen production. Maybe down a little bit since -- on a premier former basis versus when you announced the deals, but I wondering if you could talk about how those assets are performing relative to your expectations?Clay M. GasparSure, Arun. Good question. I appreciate it, and I'll look -- I'll pan out just a little bit because we did RimRock and Validus kind of back to back. I would say, from an integration standpoint, they've both gone exceptionally well. We certainly learned some things on RimRock, we immediately applied to Validus and always looking to continue to get better. Specifically on the Validus side, we're certainly learning things, I've alluded to in some of my remarks, additional upside that we didn't even contemplate in that acquisition. On the RimRock side, or the Williston, really the Northern U.S., has been plagued by some pretty cold weather. That has not -- we've definitely been affected by that. And then digging out from that, everyone is reaching for those workover rigs, kind of all reaching for the same equipment, so there's a little bit of a backlog associated with that. And then honestly, we've seen a little bit of more offset frac activity that we've shut wells in for, so that impacts things.But one of the things we're learning about the late innings in Williston is some of these wells would have kind of complicated depletion metrics to them. So you have -- might had a crosscut well that has a lower -- a little bit more depletion in part of that lateral. That's causing some interesting things around how do we clean these wells out, how do we provide the right artificial lift. We've made some really good strides there. Really excited about the latest group of wells that are coming online. But I think all 3 of those factors have caused us to probably underperform a little bit in the second quarter relative to expectations, first and second quarter. But I see that already in the second quarter, things are starting to pick up, and I'm really excited about that asset and it continues to be such a critical piece of Devon's portfolio.Arun JayaramGreat and my follow-up, Clay, it sounds like the team is working on some R&amp;D efforts to unlock inventories. So I was wondering if you could maybe detail what exactly you're testing and perhaps some opportunities to grow your inventory base?Clay M. GasparYes. There's a lot of it going around the company and a lot of stuff that we're -- is pretty early innings. We're not talking a whole lot just yet, but one that we are talking about is in South Texas, the Zgabay project, in particular. Department of Energy-funded, something that we've shared pretty broadly with the industry in a number of forums. And the real win so far have been from completion design, refracking and then the earliest knowledge we're getting around some EOR, some enhanced oil recovery. So that's all very exciting. I can tell you we've already put some of that information to work. The refracking activity is very encouraging. Some of that is pretty unique to the Eagle Ford. Talked about some of the reservoir characteristics there. It has an ability to stay really -- the original completion tends to stay very near wellbore, and so it gives you that opportunity to feather in a few more wells or other basins. That just really doesn't work very well. And then the re-stem, figuring out the techniques how to go about this, how to prosecute this and we've seen tremendous upside. So all of that is great inventory. And most of it, to be honest, is upside from what we underwrote with the Validus acquisition.OperatorOur next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist.Neal David DingmannMy first question is just on shareholder returns, specifically Rick for -- you are one of the guys. Just -- are there certain levels where you'd continue to materially lean into the buybacks based under assume sort of mid-cycle prices? And then if you continue to have some nice divestitures like you had, would those continue to go to incremental variable dips?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Neil, this is Jeff. Yes, thanks for the question.What you're going to see from us is more of the same on the model, and you described it well, which was certainly to the extent where we see opportunities to buy back our shares, when we see that valuation dislocate, if you will, from our view of the intrinsic value which certainly happened in the first quarter. Post our February call, we saw the stock trade on a relative basis to the peers in a negative way. And we jumped in with both feet and bought back shares in a big way. We think that's the beauty and the balance of our -- the flexibility of our model, which is it provides us the cash and the wherewithal to go take advantage of those opportunities. So moving forward, that's absolutely our expectation. If we see the stock trade off relative to the group or dislocate from our view of intrinsic value over the longer term, you should expect for us to lean in on the share repurchase program. All the while, our first priority is to sustain and grow the fixed dividend, which we plan to continue to do, and then feather in the variable dividend, the -- up to 50% of our free cash flow in any given quarter is going to go to the variable dividend. So that flexibility and balance that we have in the model, we think has served us really well over the last 3 years, and you should expect that to continue going forward.Neal David DingmannYes, that's great. You all stepping into that. And then secondly, my question probably, Clay, for you or Rick on the Delaware infrastructure. Rick, it sounded like you were confident, you all have the needed infrastructure now in place to handle the growth. The remainder of the year, I'm just wondering if you all could talk about now, maybe what the buildouts look like or what type of growth that infrastructure now can handle in the coming quarters. It looks like -- sounds like it's where you want it to be.Richard E. MuncriefYes. Thanks, so Neil, I mean, we've -- I mentioned Clay and Clay drove home the point. We're really confident in our infrastructure -- actually the recovery and from downtime. And more importantly, we are staying ahead of it. We have a great team that -- on the build-out. It's working really well. And then we have third-party providers that we have great relationships with, and we have a tendency to try to work a year and 2 and 3 years down the road. And when you've got the inventory we do, the execution you do, you can sit down with people and plan that out because that's what the [Permian] is going to continue to need year after year after year as continued infrastructure growth. And I'd say it's going really well.OperatorOur next question comes from John Freeman from Raymond James.John Christopher FreemanLooking at the success of the 3-milers you did on those 6 Wolfcamp wells, do you have a sense of how much of your acreage, what percent maybe of those undeveloped locations would be candidates for those 3-mile developments in the Delaware?Clay M. GasparJohn, I will wing it a little bit. I think it's about 20% this year that we're going to be drilling the 3-mile laterals. It's always a little bit in flux. We're always trying to trade the opportunities. I can tell you, our -- we feel very confident in the returns of the 2-mile laterals. That's kind of our go-to with most of our acreages set up. I think it's just really where we see those opportunities to turn a 1 mile into a 2 or turn a few ones into a 3, those turn into really phenomenal economics.So what I would say is operationally, we're very comfortable drilling 3-mile laterals today. I think we've got that recipe down. So operationally, it's not a challenge. It's strictly just looking at the land and where is it set up for 2s and where is it set up for 3s.John Christopher FreemanGreat and then just my follow-up question. I just want to make sure that in the filings, I'm kind of interpreting this correctly. So the contingency payments, the remaining $130 million you got from Barnett. At the current strip, should I assume you get the remaining $65 million in 1Q '24, the other $65 million 1Q '25 at the current strip?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, John. You're exactly right. As it relates to the contingency payments, it varies obviously by commodity price, both oil and gas. And at a $65 oil price, which above a $65 oil price where we are today, we would expect to receive around $20 million. And then from a gas price standpoint, it's tiered from $2.75 all the way up to $3.50, and the variability there is anywhere from $20 million to $45 million. So where the current strip sits today, I haven't looked at -- you're probably somewhere in the mid-3s, I would guess. So that would be another $25 million or $35 million that you could expect to receive on top of that oil payment.OperatorOur next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen.David Adam DeckelbaumJust wanted to follow up on some of the thoughts around the buybacks in the first quarter and using the cash balance opportunistically. Does that in any way sort of inform your view on how you're looking at further consolidation this year? Obviously, Devon was a pretty active participant last year, but are the opportunities that you're seeing in the A&amp;D market just sort of less robust than what you would have seen last year relative to the on value of your own stock?Richard E. MuncriefDave, good question. I think for us, when we did the 2 transactions last year, we talked about the metrics that we bought those packages at and you've heard Clay talk about some of the -- particularly down in the Eagle Ford, some of the additional upside that we've seen. So we feel very, very good about those. I think the market has pulled back up too, expectations are a little higher. Some of the packages in the market today, I think we'll probably take -- we'll look at them. But once again, we have a high bar, and I don't know that you'll see us being that active in some of the packages that are out in the market today, so we see how that all plays out. But once again, that takeaway is a high bar. And if it fits us, makes sense for our strategy, then something we may consider.David Adam DeckelbaumI appreciate that. And Clay, if I could just ask a little bit more about Zgabay. Just more around the scope of the project, how long the DOE grant last for in this partnership? And then in terms of EOR, are you looking at gas reinjection? Or is it all CO2? Is it mostly refracs? I guess just the total scope and duration and how this would be applied to some of your other active basins.Clay M. GasparYes. Excellent question. I love talking about it. This was a project that I think was originally conceived in West Texas. That project ended up falling through and through some great work of our team here being very heads up, say, hey, we've got an opportunity where we can do some of those same things in the Eagle Ford. We've got the right set up, the geology operations, and it was taken up. So we did a lot of very interesting work. We took a horizontal core to really understand that fracture network. I talked about these fractures healing up and what that means to that stimulated rock volume, and ultimately, our depletion zone that we're seeing on any individual wellbore. So we were able to see where do those fractures kind of breakthrough, where do we actually have proppant, and therefore, where do we think we're actually seeing some of the depletion. We've used that information in our stimulation design, knowing what the original recipe was, kind of how do we alter that. And then as we go back into these refracs, as you can imagine, it's a mechanical complicated activity. You have to go in and run a liner and then ultimately, you're trying to stimulate new rock. And so with this information, we've been able to leverage that science and go in and really, we believe, stimulate new and incremental rock and really up the reserves, the recoveries from these original wellbores. That's all been not just scientifically exciting in practice, seeing the returns and seeing that value come through.When we look at EOR, this project is really about injecting natural gas and a huff-and-puff kind of model. That's still an early project, understanding how that works. We have a lot of monitoring subsurface from gauges to fiber optics and really watching for what are we influencing from that injection and how ultimately we were covering more rock. So there's a lot of good information out there. The team has done a phenomenal job at presenting at various technical conferences. So if you're interested, there's lots of great intel out there to dig further into.OperatorThe next question comes from Matthew Portillo from TPH.Matthew Merrel PortilloJust to start out, as we look across the portfolio, it's nice to have a diversified asset. Curious as you guys look at the returns by basin and with the volatility in the commodity strip, how you're thinking about capital allocation to some of the basins like the Anadarko in particular, given low natural gas and NGL prices as well as some downside volatility to crude oil as we progress through the year?Clay M. GasparMatt, this is Clay. Great question. In the last 12 months, we've kind of tested every flavor of commodity price. High oil price, low oil price, high relative gas price, 10:1. It was $80 and $8 at one point. And so we've run the sophisticated model that we have in a number of scenarios really looking for when does our portfolio really command that we shift the capital allocation materially? And what was interesting is in all of those scenarios that we ran, even some of the gas-levered opportunities, it still said keep pushing towards oil, keep pushing towards the Permian, the Delaware Basin. We're still always commanding capital first.As we've matured our understanding of places like the Eagle Ford, certainly, it's risen up. And with the acquisition of Validus, it's commanding more capital, as I mentioned earlier. As we stress test the gas side, certainly, things like the gas-prone areas of the Anadarko become more stressed. But remember, the preponderance of our investment is on the Dow JV, which is the gas condensater. So you get a high -- significant amount of condensate in those wells, and then also that carry really helps us support pretty phenomenal economics even in this commodity price environment.Now look, we're always watching. We're always rerunning this. This isn't a single once-a-year scenario. This is a monthly exercise. We're always stress testing, and you can bet we're making changes on the margins. We will pull a few wells out of the system for this year, replace a few as opportunities come our way. Maybe it's a trade that just came to us or a new opportunity that the team has discovered. We're always evolving on the margins. But what I can tell you is our program is very consistent and very robust, certainly even in today's commodity price and service cost because we believe the service cost is still decoupled from today's commodity price.Matthew Merrel PortilloGreat and then, Clay, maybe as a follow-up for one of the longer-dated resource basins in your portfolio. Just curious your updated thoughts on the Powder? I know it's not overly active this year, but you'll continue to progress the Niobrara in particular. Kind of curious how you've seen results so far and how maybe the costs are stacking up there as well?Clay M. GasparMatt, great question. I love talking about the Powder because it is kind of behind-the-scenes. It is something that I'm really, really proud of the work that the team has done. On the front end of the challenge is de-risking the productivity. Making sure that when we drill a well, wherever we are in the basin, that we have a good understanding of what it can deliver. The second order is how do we get the cost structure down so that we generate the right competitive return? I can tell you on the former, we've made tremendous progress, and that's really exciting. To me, that's the -- if you don't have good rock, you can't do anything about that. We've got good rock. We've been able to improve the productivity, prove that up time and time again. On the well cost, to me, that surface considerations that we can always improve on. Have a tremendous confidence in the team to be able to drive those costs down in time. And so that is something we're now working on to ultimately get to a place of more competitive and sustainable returns.But we've got a ton of inventory there. It is very oil prone, and that will certainly have its day in the sun in the coming years. So really great progress from the team there.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC.Scott Michael HanoldJeff, I was just kind of curious. When you step back and look at the balance sheet, I mean, you got about $800 million, $900 million of cash. I know you talked about the debt coming due, you want to take down later this year. But as you start thinking about the quantum of incremental buybacks, do you all just really focus on what is left in free cash flow? Or is there some optionality to utilize the cash balance? And any color on kind of working cap per -- cash needs per working capital too would be helpful.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes. You bet, Scott. It's a good question and one we've been thinking a lot about. If you think about our cash balance, what you heard me say historically, it's somewhere between $500 million to $1 billion cash balance on the balance sheet. It's kind of what we try to optimize for and work towards. You've seen us kind of hover around that level certainly over the last several quarters.Moving forward, we're going to stay focused on the financial model that we've been pursuing for the last 3 years, with 50% going to the variable and then 50% accruing back to the balance sheet. We feel really comfortable with our leverage position where it is today. Obviously, we've got a target out there of kind of 1x net debt to EBITDA. We're significantly below that currently. We certainly would flex up and back and forth depending on the market conditions and that, again, is what we think is the real beauty of our model, which it provides us the flexibility as we did this last quarter to utilize free cash flow generated, whether it's the current quarter or previous quarters, and then push that back into a buyback program, right?So obviously, over this last quarter, we chose to pull down the cash balance. That's certainly something we might do in the future as well, depending on the market conditions that we see. And really, it's the real benefit of the flexibility of the model that we've rolled out which allows us along with the strength of our balance sheet to really step in and take advantage of opportunities. Whether it be acquisitions that we saw, obviously, last year or the stock buyback opportunity that we saw here in the first quarter.Scott Michael HanoldThat's a good answer and maybe this one is for Clay. When you think about the tighter spacing in the Eagle Ford, I know we've -- the industry has gone from tightening and widening and tightening in whether it's a Permian and the Eagle Ford before, and it seems like there's always an aptitude to eventually go back to wider spacing when oil prices come down. But can you kind of speak to the resiliency of this tighter spacing if we do see lower oil prices? Do you guys think you'll stick with it? Or is that just work given the current context around oil prices in the strip?Clay M. GasparYes. It's an excellent point because it -- we certainly, as an industry, have lived all of those spectrums, and myself included. So while we generally believe up-spacing is the right move in most basins, we would rather have more robust returns and be able to withstand a fall in commodity price. I think that has generally served us better time and time again. As we look at the Eagle Ford and certainly the maturity of that basin, we're really looking at how do you get those remaining resources most effectively depleted. And so the work that we did at Zgabay is part of the -- a significant part of the highlight. When you're really kind of sampling that rock, really understanding how that wellbore drainage is really happening downhole, that gives you great insight into not just blindly downspacing and hoping for the best or statistically hoping for the best, this gives you very good kind of tangible evidence of what we're doing there. We're going to be real cautious about it. Certainly, we have -- we've been very, very pleased with the results so far. But we will continue to watch service cost, continue to watch commodity price and always reserve the right to get smarter.OperatorOur next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateRick, it's not so long -- it's not so long ago that Devon was not only the best performing stock in the sector over an extended period, but the best performing stock the S&amp;P 500. I think it was most of 2021, if I recollect. I'm wondering, given that one could argue the market has, therefore, recognized the value of what the combined company is and benchmarking the free cash flow capacity with some additional tax headwinds perhaps going ahead, I'm wondering how you would characterize your value proposition today? What do you think you need to do to break out beyond just a call on the commodity?Richard E. MuncriefYes. I think, Doug, just -- it's incumbent upon this management team. We just need to execute. We just need to stay confident in our plan or strategy. We got great assets, and I do think we've seen some volatility speak to the outperformance that we saw a couple of years ago. That's real, very well documented. And so when you have a period of softness or what appears to be softness in execution, whether it's -- whether or not, and not weather, but whether or not, we saw a pullback and -- because it impacted our numbers. And I think in my mind, maybe a little bit too much so, and -- but at the end of the day, that sets us up for the share repurchase program. We just think that our shares are under way too much pressure. It provides a great opportunity for us and ultimately for shareholders, so that's how we're addressing it. The bottom line is we have got, as I mentioned, the assets. We've got the inventory. We're doing some great things. I think you've heard some examples from Clay around some of the technological advancements that we're making, I think in some cases, leading the industry, and that's going to continue. That's part of our genetic makeup. And so I think we just have to stay after it and stay confident with our plan and keep executing. And I think things will work out for us.Douglas George Blyth LeggateOkay. I know it's a tricky one to answer, and I appreciate your perspective. My follow-up is on the 0% to 5% growth. Not target necessarily, but outcome that you laid out at the time of the merger. Obviously, the incremental bolt-ons have got you there this year. What about the go forward? And I'm thinking what would the capital budget have to look like to support that? And do you think 12 years of inventory is enough to support that kind of go-forward visibility?Richard E. MuncriefYes. Well, first off, when we talk about the 12 years of inventory, that's -- make sure you -- we're honest with each other, and we realize that's what's -- that's not contemplating the additional inventory that we see out there that will move over to the near-term bucket. And so the way I look at it is we have closer to a 20-year inventory. When you start looking across our entire asset base, some of the ideas that we have, some of the assessment work that we're doing. I think you and I have talked about that before, making sure we continue to work for the future. So I think we've got an extended runway on inventory.So the 5% -- 0% to 5%, that's what we laid out at the time of the merger. We stuck to that gun. The way we've looked at it is, really, there has not been a huge call on getting up to that 5% growth. So our focus has been let's continue to implement on a per share basis. And so when you start looking at some of the transactions that we did, the accretion there, you start looking at the buybacks. I think that's what we hear continually from our largest shareholders, Doug. Let's focus on those per share growth metrics and let's continue to build this thing for the long haul.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.Paul ChengI have to apologize first because I want to go back into the variable dividend and buyback. Rick, you just mentioned that we should focus on the per share metrics. From that standpoint, will the buyback be a more preferred way to return cash to the shareholders and variable dividend? And also, then after more than 2 years, have we looked at it and do you believe the stock or that the company has been rewarded for the variable dividend given that your yield is so high already? That's the first question.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Paul, this is Jeff.Richard E. MuncriefYes. Go ahead, Jeff, and I'll follow up.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes. I was just going to say again, Paul, and we talked about this a lot with you in the past. With us, it's all of the above. So we've delivered on a sustainable fixed dividend which we're growing over time. We've got the framework which allows for the variable dividend up to 50% and then stock buybacks on top of that. We're not biased to one or the other. Over the long term, we think that balanced approach makes the most sense.Certainly, as Rick mentioned earlier, to the extent that we see an opportunity to jump in and buy back our shares when we see a dislocation versus intrinsic value, we're going to do that, and that has the opportunity to accrete per share growth for us over time. But at the end of the day, it's about total shareholder return, right? It's not just the dividend, it's not just the buyback, it's not just the stock price, it's that total shareholder return. And we think over the longer term, this model and this balanced approach will deliver the best results. And I'll point out over the last 2 years, we're the #1 company as it relates to total shareholder return, and that includes the last several quarters.So we feel pretty confident in our game plan. We're going to keep our head down and execute and deliver on that game plan. And we think when we wake up many, many years from now, we will have delivered a great result for shareholders.Paul ChengOkay. The second question is probably for Clay. I think you -- you answered the earlier question saying that 20% of the Delaware Basin well to be drilled this year will be 3 miles. If we look at your risk inventory of 4,500, do you have a rough estimate that what percentage of that number just on the 3 miles.Clay M. GasparPaul, I'm going to fuzzy that number. On the 20%, reminder, that's a rough number for this year and probably a little bit rougher. But I would say directionally, it's probably about the same, maybe a little bit lighter to that number as I think forward on the inventory. Remember, a lot of this happens kind of evolves in our land shop as they make trades and kind of extend that runway a little bit, so it's a pretty healthy number. Our standard is 2 miles. Again, the returns on 2-mile laterals in the Delaware Basin are phenomenal. And so we don't need that 3-mile to make the numbers work. But when it comes our way, it sure is a nice thing. And once again, I feel very confident in our operational ability to execute on 3-mile laterals. That's become a fairly standard fair for the team in the Delaware.Paul ChengAnd can you just -- curious that the opportunity of trade up and make the well from, say, 2 miles into 3 miles or even 1 mile to 3 miles, is it focusing primarily in Delaware? Or that -- another basin that you also see the opportunity there?Clay M. GasparYes. We've drilled 3-mile wells in multiple basins. And certainly, the Niobrara and the Powder is kind of built on a 3-mile concept. We've drilled at least 20 years, 30 wells, 3-mile wells in the Williston, so this is something that we feel very confident in our ability to execute on. And again, most of our performance, most of our wells we execute on are actually about 2-mile laterals in general and that's become kind of our standard. But where the opportunity presents, we feel very comfortable in executing 3-mile laterals.OperatorOur next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadYes. I'd like to come back to a couple of maybe the more operational questions. Your comments earlier about where you're seeing inflation, maybe get an idea of how sort of the, let's call it, disinflation maybe at this point would flow through? Where you're seeing it? Where we should expect to see maybe the bigger benefits?Clay M. GasparYes, Roger, this is Clay. The last couple of earnings calls, I've talked more about the tone of the conversation. And I think that's your best -- in my view, best leading indicator where prices are gone. And it's gone from a very aggressive, you-will-take-our-prices-or-you're-not-going-to-get-our-equipment circa 2 or 3 quarters ago to something a little more along the lines of, hey, we love you guys, you're our favorite customer. We really want to work with you, but we're not conceding on price. I would say state-of-the-art today is lots of inbound phone calls, lots of equipment available. They're really, really trying to hang on to pricing but some areas are starting to slip, and so we're starting to see some deflation in a couple of categories. The headline, of course, is pipe. We're seeing that kind of materially start to move through in the second half of the year. And then we're starting to see some smaller categories as well start to come down. Again, I'll remind you, for us in particular, we took our fourth quarter numbers, put about a single-digit inflation on top of that and that's kind of how we plan for '23. I think we're still kind of in line with that. We still have contracts, 2 and 3-year old contracts that are maturing this year that will be going up to offset some of the wins that we're seeing in the deflationary category.I would say state-of-the-art today, things have leveled out. We're seeing a few wins in a couple of categories, but the availability is a material change and our ability to high grade equipment, high-grade crews has really continued to translate into better operations, in fact, moving the wells quicker through the drilling and completions phase.Roger David ReadOkay. So we should expect not just a decline in cost, but you would expect also an improvement in productivity as you high grade across the board?Clay M. GasparYes, we're definitely seeing some of that. We see some of that in the second quarter already, activity kind of being pulled forward. And these are just kind of a few days at a time, but that's one of the things we're seeing from a capital standpoint in the second quarter.Roger David ReadOkay. Great. And then my follow-up question is on the refrac wells. I know it's early days in this, but I was just curious, is there a type of well or a vintage of well that works best? And then going back to a question earlier about kind of where you should put your money in terms of the returns. I'm guessing oil over gas. But just as a broad comment, how does the return on a refrac compare to the returns on new drilling, your capital program as currently laid out?Clay M. GasparYes. I think you're in the right categories when you're thinking about what is the ideal candidate. Ideally, really good rock that was really understimulated, maybe an ancient design that had a larger final string, like a 5.5-inch casing string, that you can run inside of and seal that back off and kind of reperforate and restimulate. That's kind of our ideal scenario, but we've tested beyond that. We said, what about a more modern completion? What about in not the most ideal rock, but kind of the medium rock? And we've seen favorable results there.As you can imagine, it acts up like any portfolio. You have some of your best candidates that compete head-to-head with new wells. And then you have lots of kind of middle grade contact -- middle-grade opportunities, and those are the ones we're continuing to evaluate. Maybe there's a little tweak on the stimulation design that we can push those into the very best category, like some of those ones we've seen upfront. So still relatively early days, but very pleased with the progress. And again, this is -- the beautiful thing is the land is already paid for, the surface facility is already paid for, the infrastructure is already in place, and that can really help these returns from an immediacy and a capital efficiency standpoint.Scott CoodyWell, it looks like we're at the end of our time slot for today. We appreciate everyone's interest in Devon, and if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Hasbro is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$747m ÷ (US$8.9b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Therefore, Hasbro has an ROCE of 11%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Leisure industry average it falls behind. See our latest analysis for Hasbro roceIn the above chart we have measured Hasbro's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Hasbro here  for free.So How Is Hasbro's ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Hasbro, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 18%, but since then they've fallen to 11%. Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased.Story continuesIn Conclusion...We're a bit apprehensive about Hasbro because despite more capital being deployed in the business, returns on that capital and sales have both fallen. Investors haven't taken kindly to these developments, since the stock has declined 19% from where it was five years ago. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Hasbro   (of which 2 are concerning!) that you should know about.While Hasbro may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

In 2022, Yum! was named to 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list and made the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America, marking its sixth consecutive year on the list that ranks companies based on long-term economic, environmental and social criteria. In addition, Yum! was ranked on Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies 2023.Yum! and its brands are also working on a variety of projects to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which have resulted in a decrease of approximately 20% in franchisee restaurants since 2019. In the U.S., Pizza Hut is doing its part by partnering with the Dairy Farmers of America and suppliers on a joint project to provide participating farmers with a cup that assesses their cows' feed to efficiently produce dairy with less waste. Taco Bell is building partnerships with electric vehicle charging companies to install charging stations across the U.S. at its restaurants. Meanwhile, the KFC Global development team has been crafting Green Line Furniture, which aims to have a lower impact on the environment and will be incorporated into new restaurants and extensive remodels across multiple markets beginning this year.Employees are getting involved, too. In California, Taco Bell's Business Employee Resource Group - aptly named Purple Planet - offered a sustainability-related activity every week in April, including a composting workshop and a tour of their local waste facility. At KFC, the brand's global division recently hired Nira Johri as its first chief sustainability officer. She will lead KFC's ESG initiatives, including the implementation of Yum!'s new packaging policy, which places an emphasis on the elimination of unnecessary packaging, a shift to more sustainable materials and support of better recycling systems and reusable products.Story continuesGoing forward, Yum! will continue its focus on climate and packaging as it marches toward its science-based targets to reduce emissions by nearly 50% by 2030 and have all consumer-facing plastic packaging be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Yum!'s holistic approach to environmental issues also addresses deforestation, sustainable sourcing, water and waste. For example, Yum! endorsed the New York Declaration on Forests and the private-sector goal of eliminating deforestation from the production of agriculture commodities such as palm oil, soy, paper and beef products no later than 2020. In addition, this effort strives to end natural forest loss by 2030. Yum! also has a goal to reduce average restaurant water consumption by 10%, from its 2017 baseline, by the end of 2025.With the aforementioned initiatives and more to come, Yum! is reinforcing its long-term commitment to the responsible stewardship of the planet in line with its Good Growth strategy.Yum!

322,79d81aa9-d4e8-33e1-a7d8-bce0c5470acf,MCD,2023-05-10,These 2 Fast Food Stocks Look Delicious in a Recession Year,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-fast-food-stocks-look-155522428.html,1683647722,STORY,"['MCD', 'QSR']","[It's hard to say when or if we'll fall from an economic downturn to a full-blown recession. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says the economy is ""strong,"" shooting down some of the recession fears that many market participants may have held onto in recent quarters. At this juncture, Yellen says a so-called ""soft landing"" is still a possibility. Despite Yellen's encouraging comments on the economy, she warned that an ""economic catastrophe"" could be in store if the U.S. debt ceiling is not raised. Over the coming weeks, we'll see what unfolds. Regardless, I don't think Yellen's calls will go unnoticed by the market.MCD 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MCDPeter Lynch Chart of MCDEven if debt ceiling concerns weigh on the market rally's momentum, I don't think there's a need for investors to panic. Indeed, a lack of timely debt-ceiling increases could bring forth some risk to stock valuations, increasing the chances for value opportunities to appear Year to date, the stock market has had a very respectable relief-driven run. Whether or not it will continue to hold remains a mystery.For now, careful preparation for potential bear-case scenarios may prove wise. The recent earnings results haven't all been awful. The U.S. economy may very well continue rolling along from here, perhaps avoiding any sort of steep recession. When it comes to recession preparation, there are many ways investors can prepare, including having some dry powder on the sidelines, though that's become a less popular strategy as inflation has remained high. But for those who already have a sufficient safety net set up, I believe fast food stocks may be worth a look as recession plays.Fast food stocks tend to hold up the fort, even when economic conditions become less sanguine. Though no stock is immune from downside risks, I continue to view the fast food scene favorably as we head into difficult times. Even if there is a soft landing, they should still perform well. Thus, let's take a look at two of my favorite fast food stocks that recently reported encouraging quarterly results.Story continuesMcDonald's: I'm lovin' the recent rallyMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continues to be loved by customers and investors amid the more challenging macro backdrop. The stock recently spiked from around $263 per share to just shy of the $300 mark. The two-month-long rally has begun to slow, but I wouldn't look for shares to surrender too much of the recent gains as the company continues exploring new ways to drive its profitability.According to McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's has really ""refocused on operational excellence."" As efficiency gains come flowing in, McDonald's may very well find itself in a ""Goldilocks"" type of scenario.Foot traffic has been impressive, even as the company subtly hiked its prices to provide some relief from high inflation. As the company looks to become more efficient while updating some of its core menu items, I'd look for McDonald's stock to be in a great spot to outperform the broader S&amp;P 500. At the end of the day, McDonald's is a company that I believe can act resilient when economic growth is poised to take a bit of a slide.Further, McDonald's CEO seems to be doing so many things right at the helm of the golden arches. I believe the respectable performance of the stock (shares are up more than 12% year to date) is thanks in large part to his operational improvements.As of this writing, shares of McDonald's trade for a price-earnings ratio of 31.87. That's not cheap for a fast food company, even one that can power through a turbulent period in the economy. The 2.05% forward dividend yield is also on the lower end. While I'd prefer waiting for a pullback, I'm not so sure we'll get one so soon after the company's latest quarterly top- and bottom-line beat.Restaurant Brands International: The recent run may not be over just yetRestaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) has seen its stock really take off, up 42% over the past year. Like McDonald's, Restaurant Brands just came off a nice earnings beat. Burger King and Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen played a key role in helping the company deliver a genuinely delicious quarter.I think it's safe to say that the business recovery in Restaurant Brands is already underway. As the company continues to deliver for investors, I expect more analysts to hike their price targets on the name. For now, shares actually still look very attractive at a price-earnings ratio of 22.17. That's well below the likes of McDonald's and many of Restaurant Brands' peers.Personally, with the stock's recent earnings growth, I don't think the steep discount warranted, especially given the huge beat the company pulled off for its latest quarterly report. With a 3.07% forward dividend yield that towers over the competition, I think Restaurant Brands is poised to continue impressing as we move into the latter half of 2023. There's a lot of momentum that I think is sustainable.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) are two examples of how just regularly putting money into shares of the top consumer brands can go a long way toward growing your savings for retirement.

Customers are smart. Our guests come in, and they don't want to get nickel and dimed,"" Hochman said on Yahoo! Finance Live (video above).It's hard to argue diners at Chili's are getting ripped off on the Big Bacon BBQ burger. At a cost of $17.19, you get nearly 1,700 calories, consisting of two enormous patties, six slices of bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, red onion, pickles, and a side of fries.For a value-focused restaurant player such as Brinker, giving diners more bang for their buck worked out well in the first quarter.Same-restaurant sales at Chili's and Maggiano's rose a hearty 9.6% and 21.6%, respectively. The company said the sales gains were fueled by higher menu prices and more orders of premium items like that Big Bacon BBQ burger.Operating profit margins for Brinker rose to 13.4% from 13.1% a year ago. Margins improved year over year at both Chili's and Maggiano's.Earnings per share surged 34% from a year earlier.The big burgers at Chili's are moving. (Chili's)Serving up feasts at a great price has also worked out well for long-time Brinker International competitor Darden (DRI), owner of value chains Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse.Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden rose 12.3% in the most recent quarter, followed by a 10.8% increase at Longhorn Steakhouse.Operating profits increased 16% from a year ago for Darden.""Consumers continue to seek value, which is not about low prices,"" Darden CEO Rick Cardenas told analysts on an earnings call.Shares of Brinker International and Darden are up 16% and 11%, respectively this year, compared to a 7.7% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesSuccessful quarters (and as a result, favorable stock-price reactions) for some of the country's largest sit-down restaurant chains come amid growing economic stress on lower-income to middle-income diners.These cohorts have taken to cutting back on items purchased at fast-food chains such as McDonald's (MCD) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) owned Dairy Queen.The read may be that these cash-strapped diners see greater overall value in spending a little more sitting down to eat at a Chili's or Olive Garden for all-you-can-eat breadsticks or a 1,700-calorie burger and fries for under $20.A less stomach-filling McDonald's Big Mac, fries, and soda could set you back more than $15, depending on where you live.Says Brinker's Hochman, ""Guests know when they are getting a fair deal and they are getting abundant quality.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Paccar and Fox Factory Holding are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PCAR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.63, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 18.53. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.96. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.70.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.74. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 3.47.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of A and FOXF's Value grade of C.PCAR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

The $10 Amazon Pickup promotion isn't new,"" the company said in a statement. Amazon did not say for how long this or similar pickup promotions have been in use.Amazon over the last few days has emailed an undisclosed number of its shoppers offering them $10 to retrieve an order of $25 or more at company pickup points at locations such as Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh or Kohl's stores.Upstate New York-based shipping consultant Dean Maciuba was among the customers who received the offer.Increasing use of Amazon pickup locations would help the company bypass costly residential package dropoffs and is ""a huge opportunity for Amazon to reduce the cost of delivery,"" Maciuba said.It also helps train consumers to tender returns directly to the company, he said.Amazon separately has started charging some customers a $1 fee if they return packages via a United Parcel Service store when there is an Amazon pickup/return location closer to their delivery address, a change first reported by The Information news site.Shipping companies UPS and FedEx have encouraged customers to use so-called access points, particularly in rural areas where delivering to far-flung addresses can be cost-prohibitive.Amazon worked for years to train consumers to expect fast, no-fee deliveries and returns. As the company tightens its belt after a period of explosive growth, it has made numerous moves to reduce delivery-related costs across the company.Amazon late last year hiked the price of its annual Prime subscription that includes free shipping benefits by $20 to $139. It also has raised minimum order thresholds for free grocery delivery, encouraged customers to have all of their packages delivered on a designated day of the week, and expanded speedier same-day parcel delivery with a fee for orders under $25.

The Teamsters national negotiation committee directed supplemental committee chairmen to return to their bargaining tables to resume negotiations, according to a Teamsters statement Monday.In the first national meeting on Monday, which was largely ceremonial, the Teamsters shared a handful of non-economic proposals to the UPS National Master Agreement. UPS executives shared a few pages briefly summarizing some of the company’s own proposed contract changes.According to the statement, Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien told UPS (NYSE:UPS) across the table to act fast to quickly abolish the 22.4 two-tier job classification for package car drivers and eliminate its use of personal vehicle delivery drivers (PVDs). Known by the classification number in the contract, 22.4 drivers are full-time workers who the Teamsters said don’t receive the same employment status of senior workers even though they put in the same work.“If UPS really wants to get serious and get national talks underway, they should get rid of these unequal 22.4 positions and watered-down gig economy PVDs right now. It’d be very easy,” O’Brien said. “We cannot allow movement on national negotiations to stagnate around UPS’ perpetual inaction. The Teamsters want UPS to start responding to some of our biggest issues or make final plans to wrap up supplemental negotiations. Let’s get this done.”As recently as mid-April, the Teamsters warned that there would be no national negotiations until all of the 40 supplementals, which generally have a more specific impact on workers’ benefits in their geographic areas. The Teamsters accused UPS of foot dragging on negotiating 30 of the 40 original supplementals.Story continuesBased on where things stand, however, progress has been made. According to the Teamsters, UPS agreed that the company preferred to see supplements reach tentative agreement as quickly as possible.“The proof is in the pudding,” said Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. “While we evaluate initial non-economic national proposals, we have asked our supplemental committees to work out final issues with UPS. If UPS isn’t playing games, we should all see these regional contracts agreed to by both sides very soon.”In a statement Friday, UPS said the company and the union have made “good progress” in the past few weeks negotiating nearly all the supplementals.The Local 89 supplemental committee returned to work at Teamsters headquarters. Teams bargaining the “NorCal” supplement continued to work remotely from Sacramento, California.The post UPS, Teamsters national negotiations begin as supplemental talks conclude appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

We have with us today, Caryn Seidman-Becker, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Cornick, Co-Founder, President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in the company's reports and on file with the SEC, including today's shareholder letter. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements that may be discussed during this call. During this call, the company will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter in the most recently filed annual report on Form 10-Q. These items can be found on the Investor Relations section of Clear's website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Caryn.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerGood morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. At CLEAR, we believe identity is the key to transforming customer experiences, both physically and digitally. We also believe trust is the oxygen the digital world needs to thrive as the world has moved online and anonymity is the new norm. The opposite of an anonymity is authenticated identity. The acceleration of the digital world has increased the sense of urgency to get identity right. When CLEAR LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, came together to explore how we could join forces to enhance digital trust and safety at scale, we aligned on a shared vision to strengthen and democratize trust across the world's largest professional network through stronger connections, better conversations and improved outcomes. Through our recently launched partnership, we are empowering LinkedIn's over 200 million U.S. users to verify their identity on their profile using CLEAR for free. Together, we are making it safer and easier for people to find jobs, connect and build community. Verified profiles provide a holistic understanding of those users' professional identities. It's not just about who you are, it's about all the things that make you you. This partnership isn't about driving CLEAR Plus memberships. It's about furthering powered by CLEAR, our identity as a service platform to expand our connected identity ecosystem. It's about bringing the trusted, predictable friction-free experiences you've come to expect in airports to the digital world. We remain intent on providing American travelers with the experiences they rightfully deserve. Travel is absolutely booming.In March, we saw our highest average daily verification numbers. And in the first quarter, over 10% of checkpoint traffic in our airports came through a CLEAR lane. Travel is hard and getting harder. As we continue to stress, CLEAR is on the side of the American traveler, we hear our members when they say they are always looking for CLEAR and more airports. And we hear them when they say they want the joyful journey we provide in more places. CLEAR gives our members predictability and control over their time and their experiences. This is now the expectation. With 52 CLEAR Plus and 17 Reserve airports, we are expanding our network across the country and around the world. Our expanded network is, of course, good for our members, and it also allows us to launch new products like TSA PreCheck enrollment and Reserve with strength across a larger footprint. We are focused on building products for all travelers, whether you travel once a year or once a week. I would be remiss not to mention our newly revamped CLEAR app with an awesome new home-to-gate feature driving predictability and friction-free day of travel experience. I highly recommend everyone on the call uses it. As always, we remain focused on growing members, bookings and free cash flow. I want to thank the CLEAR team for their continued great work this quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Ken.Story continuesKenneth L. CornickThanks, Caryn. The first quarter finished strong with revenue up 46% and bookings up 39%. We see continued momentum into the second quarter. CLEAR Plus bookings growth came through a variety of channels, word of mouth, in-airport sales, digital marketing and our partners. The in-airport channel represented over 60% of new bookings, while partner channels, which include United, Delta and American Express represented less than 20% combined. We've never been traditional marketers. No one wakes up and Googles how do I get through airport security using biometrics. With 52 airports, 139 lanes and our great ambassadors, our physical footprint is unique and drives efficient growth. It's why such a large percentage of our bookings come from our in-airport channels. For the 2.5 million passengers who come through an airport on any given day, they can't miss our pods, our people or our experience in action. We will continue leveraging this physical footprint while incorporating our partner channels. If you think about the top 100 million travelers in the U.S., they belong to many different loyalty programs, most belong to an airline program, a car rental or a hotel loyalty program and/or have an American Express card. These partners are excited to bring the CLEAR experience to their customers and align with our brand and our products. Let's look at our Amex partnership, for example, as we near the second anniversary. This is a 3-year deal with 2 1-year renewal options. It's a true win-win for CLEAR, Amex and our shared customers. This partnership has driven steady membership growth and expanded our TAM, indexing to a younger demographic. Platinum members use CLEAR at similar rates with similar NPS scores to our overall base. From a margin perspective, we saw 1,250 basis points of operating leverage in the quarter, with total expense growth of 31% versus revenue growth of 46%. This excludes the noncash nonoperational items called out in the release. We achieved this operating leverage while opening 12 new airports and expanding 4 markets subsequent to Q1 '22, our largest number of new launches in a 12-month period. As discussed in our letter, newer airports tend to be margin dilutive in the near term. In fact, the new launches and expansions impacted operating margins by about 350 basis points this quarter. We expect these markets to follow historical margin improvement trends as we have seen in dozens of airports in the last 13 years operating this business. Today, we spoke about our newest powered by CLEAR partners, LinkedIn and Health Gorilla. I will add that we see exciting traction on the platform side. And as platform bookings scale, this is another driver of operating leverage as we have made significant investments in the platform over the past several years. Free cash flow in the quarter was $51 million, up 165%. I want to reiterate last quarter's comment on equity-based compensation. We absolutely view this as a real expense. Free cash flow after employee and founder stock comp was $36 million, up 470%. We continue to expect full year growth in free cash flow before and after stock comp. Total cash and marketable securities as of March 31 was $779 million and reflects approximately $6.5 million invested in share repurchase at an average price of $22.94 as well as $2.4 million used to net settle RSUs. In addition, we made a $6 million minority equity investment in landline, a company well positioned to help securely scale off-airport screening. In addition to repurchases, today, we announced a $0.20 special dividend. This dividend is a result of CLEAR's advantageous corporate structure put in place when we went public. Through the utilization of favorable tax attributes, actual taxes over minimized, enabling the return of capital to our owners. Our bookings guidance of $158 million to $160 million implies year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and excludes any contribution from PreCheck. We continue to expect operating leverage and free cash flow growth on a full year basis. As owner operators, capital allocation and optionality are cornerstones of our strategy, whether it's share repurchase, dividends, organic growth or acquisitions, we are focused on driving long-term value. We will now go to Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyNice to see the progress. As you think about the soft launch of TSA in mid-2023, are you talking second quarter or third quarter? And any update on how you expect revenues to build from that? And then also on the net member retention, anything in marketing wise that you can do to win back previously canceled members or anything you're seeing there? And then just any adjustments that you're seeing in the new airports being added of how that performance trends.Kenneth L. CornickYou Got 3 in there, so that's good.So we'll start with PreCheck. Look, we're really excited to launch this program. No one wants to get it launched more than us to the traveling public. And as we mentioned last time, we got our ATO, which is the authority to operate in December. Our teams continue to work together with TSA to make progress. There's a process to follow. We're following it. And we don't include any PreCheck revenue in the Q2 guidance, we would expect it to be a back half and it would build as we roll it out from airport to airport, renewals would happen faster.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerSo Dana, don't forget that there's 2 parts to the business. There's the renewal part for the existing member base, and then there's the new member additions, and we're excited about both. One is more digital and one would happen more in person. Your next question -- the next question was on retention.Kenneth L. CornickSo from a retention perspective, retention is definitely stronger than we anticipated. It continues to be, and part of that is the win-back strategy. So we have a lot of organic win back. So people just show up at the airport who -- maybe their credit card didn't charge properly. So when they come through the lane, they would just swipe their credit card and win back. That's about 2/3 of our win back activity. So that continues strong. We have ongoing programs to win back people, that's a regular part of our business. And overall, I would say that continues with strength and retention in general is higher than where we expect it to wind up long term in the upper 80s. And as far as new airports, we talked a bunch about new airports in our letter. The new airports are very fast breakeven, cash breakeven usually within a year. And costs from a -- direct cost perspective are definitely higher in the beginning. Their margins -- they tend to be margin dilutive. And then over time, as we increase penetration in those airports, the margins expand. We have very high incremental margins. And so what I would say is we opened more airports in the last 12 months than we ever have, it's a record. And so there is some margin impact from that. But as we've seen operating the business since 2010, we see a regular path of margin expansion as we scale penetration. And we mentioned in the letter, we have 2% MSA or CSA penetration from a population perspective in the 47 airports and then our top 5 are at 5%. So we think there's a long runway for growth.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerAnd Dana, just to add to that, when you talk about the power of the network effect, when we open a new airport, hundreds of people show up on day 1 to verify, right? So those are people who already have CLEAR and wouldn't have been able to use it in that airport. But that extra utilization is so powerful from a retention, growth add, all those good things. And so you are seeing new airports ramp much faster than they did years ago because, right, it's #52 to the network, not #20.OperatorNext question comes from Josh Reilly with Needham &amp; Company.Joshua Christopher ReillyCongrats on the strong results and the bookings guidance here for Q2. I guess the question I'm getting a lot is -- and you highlight this in the shareholder letter, but the penetration for airports you operate still remains very low. However, offsetting that is the impact of the slowing growth in TSA boarded passengers over the next couple of quarters. How do you maintain this kind of strong growth trajectory, even if TSA passenger growth continues to slow near term, just simply due to the tough year-over-year comps.Kenneth L. CornickSo thanks for the question. So we think travel will continue to grow. We have capacity growth in the back half that we've seen from airlines. But our growth is diversified. It comes from a number of different channels, right? So we have in-airport growth, which we said in the letter, is 60% of our growth. We have partner channels. And so we think that our ability to growth is not necessarily impacted on any given quarter by the delta and the TSA volume growth. So we think we have a lot of opportunity.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerLook, I would add to that. If you specifically look on a city like New York, New York had record first quarter. This is Port Authority data, record first quarter in travel, 33 million. That was up 1 million from pre-pandemic 2019. So you see airlines that have said capacity is still expected to be up 10% to 15% in the second half of the year. In March, we saw our highest average daily verifications. And so when you talk about that 2% penetration on average, right, in most of our airports, there is ways to go as CLEAR is still pretty new to a lot of these travelers, right? We've owned -- there's -- I think we wrote -- we talked about 1/3 of our airports are less than 3 years old. This is still a pretty new concept overall. And so when you talk about the sort of vintage, if you will, of our airports, the power of word of mouth, the ambassadors on the ground, our partners, which Ken talked about, United, Delta and American Express being also growth engines and introducing CLEAR to a expanded TAM. Ken can talk a little bit to American Express, if you want and sort of the expanded demographics there. And so there are many ways for CLEAR to grow, not to mention new products, bundles and things of that nature. So we continue to believe that these are early days, but I will also say, we just are incredibly bullish on travel, and it's hard and getting harder. And so the fact that there is growth, the fact that people are looking for the experiences they have outside the airport, in the airport, the fact that we have low penetration, a stronger network and offering and great partners, early days.Joshua Christopher ReillyGot it. And then just a follow-up on the PreCheck offering. Is there anything going on in the testing phase with the TSA that gives you more confidence around that time frame for the second half launch than maybe a quarter or 2 ago?Kenneth L. CornickYes. So after receiving the (inaudible) in December, there is a process, and we continue along with that process, and we are making progress.Joshua Christopher ReillyGot it. And I'll just sneak in one last final question for me. On the Amex Green Card, this is the first full quarter, I believe, with that in the market. What type of adoption trends did you -- have you seen from that card thus far?Kenneth L. CornickSo I won't speak to any one particular portfolio within the Amex family, but we are getting a lot of questions on Amex. So why don't I just give a little bit of insight into the partnership overall. And what I would say is this continues to be a great partnership. The value of CLEAR to these members is evident. We see usage trends and NPS scores for the Platinum members and in line with the rest of our base. So from a value perspective, we're delivering value to those members. It's a great way to introduce CLEAR to the new population and it's expanded our TAM. We talked about over 1/3 of our markets are still less than 3 years old, and the penetration is low, as Caryn just mentioned. So this is a really great way to introduce CLEAR to a newer and a younger demographic, right? It's expanded our TAM. We skew younger with platinum. It indexes to the under 45-year-old demographic. And from an NPV and the lifetime value, this is really exciting. There's a low CAC, obviously. There's high renewal rates. And given the scale of this partnership, the average revenue per member is well below our overall retail price point. So right, the incremental member growth is contributing less to our bookings and revenue, but more to the expansion of our TAM and to our membership base in general. And as we mentioned in the letter, 60% of the new bookings are coming from the in-airport channel and less than 20% overall of the new bookings are coming from the partner channels, including Delta, United and Amex combined, but it continues to be a great partnership for us.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.David B. UngerIt's David Unger filling in for Michael Turrin. I had a bunch of Amex, but we don't have to keep going at Amex. So the 2Q bookings guide is pretty strong actually at the high end suggesting 30% year-on-year growth. Can you guys talk about some of the moving pieces that sustaining that pretty strong growth rate, more we're at in the cycle? It's above where most of us were originally modeling. So any seasonality to be mindful of there?Kenneth L. CornickSure. I would just say, in general, our business is fairly consistent to understand, right? We have renewal of prior year revenues or bookings. We have multiple channels, as I've been saying in this call, multiple channels that are contributing to our growth. We have in-airport. We have ambassadors. We have a physical presence when we have 2.5 million people coming through the airports on a given day and they can't miss us, right? There's a physical presence. We have ambassadors engaging with them. So there's multiple channels to drive that growth plus the retention and plus we've taken a little bit of pricing.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerIf I can just jump in, maybe we've done a bad job of explaining that this is a great business and members are passionate about CLEAR. And so the more airports that we open, the more people join, there's family attach rates and travel is hard and getting harder. And I do think that the experience that you see outside of the airports, whether it be ordering food online compared to what that experience was 10 years ago or flagging down in Uber, this is the new consumer expectation. And people are looking for that in travel. They're looking for the home-to-gate app to know when to leave their house to get to the airport -- or to get to their gate with 40 minutes because we've mapped it all out. They're looking for predictability and friction-free experiences. And our brand has now become synonymous with that. And I do think that these -- when we talk about early days, -- there's a bunch of new airports. When you look at the growth coming out of 2019 or heading in and then sort of screeching to a halt with COVID, we've expanded our airports. We've added 19 now in a little less than 2 years. So I think it's just a confluence or convergence of events of customer expectations, the growth of the network and new products that we're offering and then the power of the network to retention, to gross adds and to partners. And you are seeing our brands show up in more places, whether it be our partnership with LinkedIn or when you use it at a sports stadium or at a hospital. And so this concept of friction-free experience is and a brand that stands for trust and what we did with Health Path in COVID, I think it's a testament to the vision and to the team making it happen.David B. UngerThat's all awesome. So obviously, I appreciate the special dividend. You guys don't have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. [We're on the program,] I'd love to hear and free cash flow is still boding very nice. Just bigger picture, would love to hear about the capital management philosophy. If you could share that with us.Kenneth L. CornickSure. I think philosophically, we believe in being opportunistic. And so we want to maintain maximum flexibility. We're opportunistic, and we're owner-operators. So we're aligned with shareholders in general.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Chung with JPMorgan.Paul ChungSo just on the LinkedIn partnership, talk about how that deal came about, how to kind of think about monetization in respect to that $200 million sub base. What other kind of social media platforms or other use cases we should be thinking about? Essentially, how should we kind of think about platform contribution through the year and kind of longer term? Another follow-up.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerPerfect. We're really excited about the LinkedIn partnership because big picture, trust online matters and the acceleration of the digital world has created an absolute sense of urgency to get identity right. So many things that you're hearing about today in the news. If you sort of strip them back, you realize identity -- it's about identity. Identity is foundational. So LinkedIn and CLEAR and Microsoft definitely came together with a shared vision that trust online matters, trust and safety for their hundreds of millions of users are core to their brand and to their future. And so it was that alignment. At some level, we always say our best form of BD or happy CLEAR members. I think when people go through the experience, they start to realize the other places that you could use CLEAR. And so having a verified badge on your LinkedIn profile means users are more likely to be considered for a job to have their InMail opened or to build connections. And so when you look at what the future is, it's to have hundreds of millions of LinkedIn members with verified badges on their profile and then to have reasons right or benefits for those badges. So again, InMain, [key parts] of job searches, someone more likely to open your request for a connection. And those things create powerful networks in the new age of, I would say, anonymity online, and this is authenticated identity online, the absolute opposite. So I do think that this serves as a model for other online marketplaces and networks and one that CLEAR can play an important role in. Also, as I talked about earlier this morning, this is not about selling CLEAR Plus membership. This is about our identity as a service platform business. And so you will see that scale on both members and revenues over this year and in the future. It's a core focus for us. The vision that we had 13 years ago was absolutely right. And I think the world has now recognized the need for trust online is crucial, and CLEAR is a really important partner in that equation.Paul ChungVery cool stuff. And then secondly, can you talk about the strength of free cash flow in the quarter? Anything that call out there? So earnings continue to improve, bookings growth feeding accrued nicely. As we move through the year and think about seasonality, can we expect this kind of quarterly run rate of free cash flow that kind of builds into 2Q, payment out in 3Q and accrued and then kind of rebound in pace in 4Q. Is that the right way to kind of think about it? And then given the strong start to the year, do you think we're on track to exceed '22 levels?Kenneth L. CornickYes. So from a free cash flow perspective, look, generally speaking, we're an asset-light business. We are opening airports, but they're cash -- they're generally cash breakeven in under a year. From a free cash flow perspective, we have said that we expect to grow free cash flow on a full year basis year-over-year in 2023, and that stems from bookings growth and operating leverage, which we also said we're going to generate operating leverage in 2023 on a full year basis. As far as cadence, you are correct that there will be a cash outflow in Q3 as there was last year. But again, on a full year basis, given the way our business works, we have bookings which generally exceed GAAP when we're -- GAAP revenue when we're growing, and that's the nature of a subscription-based business. And it flows to the bottom line and from a free cash flow perspective as we collect cash upfront. So to reiterate, yes, grow free cash flow on a full year basis versus 2022, both before and after stock comp and demonstrate operating leverage on a full year basis and cash outflow in Q3, that's correct.Paul ChungGreat. And then just a follow-up on the leverage. How do we think about kind of modeling seasonality, investments and kind of overall trends for the year between the kind of OpEx line items, the pace in 2Q and where we can see more leverage in the model?Kenneth L. CornickSure. Without getting into specific quarterly guidance, generally speaking, I would say G&amp;A is the area where you see the most operating leverage. R&amp;D is still going to be an area of investment for us, although we should demonstrate operating leverage there as well. From a cost of revenue share fee, we expect that to be fairly stable over time. There is some quarterly volatility as we saw in Q1. And finally, on the labor line, that should now grow in line with opening new airports, number one. Obviously, when we open new airports, we're hiring new people individually at that local level. And there should be some growth along with volume and opportunities to enroll new members. But generally, we expect to see scale operating leverage across the board, mostly -- the most in G&amp;A and then less so in the cost of revenue, which is more of a variable.OperatorOur next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.Ananda Prosad BaruahYes, 2 or 3, if I could. Ken, you mentioned that, I think, in response to one of the questions that you have capacity growth in the back half of the year or something along those lines. And I was wondering what that kind of refers to? Some context there would be great.Kenneth L. CornickCapacity growth, I don't actually know what you're referring to from the capacity...Ananda Prosad BaruahIt was one of the questions around air travel. And yes, we can take it offline. It's just a clarification about that.Kenneth L. CornickFrom a macro perspective. Yes, we've seen the airlines talk about capacity growth in the back half.Ananda Prosad BaruahI see. Okay. Great. Super helpful. And then I guess just sticking kind of with that theme, do you guys have a like return to business travel view in terms of pacing and impact and whether it's for you guys or for the industry, I would just love to get any context there that you guys might have as an opinion at least.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerMy opinion is being on the road for a few conferences, both at the HIMSS conference for health care in Chicago and the Milken conference last week in L.A., it is -- there's overflow rooms that are holding overflow rooms. It's insane. So we continue to have a very bullish outlook on travel on both the leisure side and the business side. We send surveys out to members, which is really the way that we know it, and I think we continue to see a return to business travel staying strong.Ananda Prosad BaruahCaryn, that's super helpful. Maybe to try to drill down a little bit. Do you have any sense or any opinion on like what inning -- whatever normalized travel might look like -- business travel might look like ultimately? Do you have any opinion on what inning we might be to the return of that normalized currently?Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerYes. I do not because we focus more on holistic, right, number of people getting on planes and coming through airports on the travel side of our business. And I would say that holistically, again, and that's why I was talking about the airline capacity going up 10% to 15%. I think both planes are oversold these days. And so we continue to be very positive on the industry as a whole and volume, but I don't have a good feel for you for a breakdown of business.Ananda Prosad BaruahNo, that's all super helpful context. So I appreciate it. And I guess last one for me is any -- I guess, another one, like what would be -- what's a good way for us to think about lane -- additional lane expansion opportunity inside of existing airports that you guys have? And that's it for me.Kenneth L. CornickYes. So that's a great question, and we're actually very focused on expanding our capacity. Two recent examples in Dulles, where we've seen a lot of growth in membership. We actually expanded to an additional PreCheck lane recently, I think it was last week or the week before. And this summer, we'll be launching in the international terminal in Atlanta, which is a -- which is probably our most constrained market. And so that will increase capacity for our members fairly dramatically.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerAnd I think last quarter, we added a terminal in Newark. So we continue to focus from an obsession with the customer experience perspective on technology, on lanes, on innovation. And so you'll continue to see both new airport expansion, lane expansion within our current airports and innovation that drives throughput, and then you saw an investment in landline. So we think that there are so many opportunities to continue to transform the customer experience because it's not just today that we're excited by travel. We think by 2030, there's going to be another 1 million people coming through airports on top of the 2.5 million that are there today. So when we think about lane and airport of the future, there's a lot of innovation going on.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Caryn Seidman-Becker for closing comments.Caryn Gail Seidman-BeckerThank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I think as you heard us say, identity is foundational in travel and beyond. We're excited with the strong progress of both CLEAR's B2C and B2B dual growth engines. And as always, I want to thank the CLEAR team for all of their great work this quarter. Thank you.OperatorThis conclude today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for NiSource How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NiSource is:8.7% = US$698m ÷ US$8.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.Does NiSource Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see NiSource has a similar ROE to the average in the Integrated Utilities industry classification (8.7%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for NiSource by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesNiSource's Debt And Its 8.7% ROENiSource clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.45. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: NiSource may not be the best stock to buy.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Boston ScientificNotably, that recent sale by Eric Francis Thepaut is the biggest insider sale of Boston Scientific shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$53.09, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 81% of Eric Francis Thepaut's holding.In the last year Boston Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Boston Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Boston Scientific. In total, insider Eric Francis Thepaut dumped US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Boston Scientific insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$183m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Boston Scientific Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Boston Scientific stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Boston Scientific is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for Boston Scientific (1 is a bit concerning!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course Boston Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

Hear from two Boston Scientific employees about how their involvement in the Pacific East Asian Resources in Leadership (PEARL) employee resource group has enriched their work lives, and how their experiences as both mentor and mentee have helped shape their careers.""I am truly accepted for who I am as a person""Born to Japanese and Chinese parents, Yixuan Yuki Ji possessed drive, ambition and a deep appreciation for culture and differing perspectives at a young age. This would lead her to excel professionally within multiple industries and across several continents, before eventually becoming a senior manager of Medical Affairs and Education at Boston Scientific.As a young adult, Yixuan moved from Beijing to Germany with her parents. She worked in foreign affairs for a few years before she started working at a global automotive company. There, a mentor gave her some sage advice: ""He told me to diversify my understanding as much as possible,"" she says. ""He stressed the value of learning many aspects of business - everything that happens from development to the product making its way into the hands of the customer."" So that is what she did, spending her early professional years in product distribution, marketing, sales and account management.After marrying her husband, a U.S. Army veteran, Yixuan now lives in Houston, Texas. In her role at Boston Scientific, she partners with physicians to raise awareness of potentially life-saving treatments. She is also the global lead for the Pacific East Asian Resources in Leadership, or PEARL, employee resource group (ERG). ""Through PEARL, I've had an opportunity to enhance my leadership skills and form lasting connections with others who share my Asian heritage, and the allies who support us,"" she says.Story continuesAnother major benefit has been the mentorship opportunities. ""When I came to the company 12 years ago, I joined the formal mentoring program offered by EmpowHER, the ERG dedicated to the advancement of women,"" says Yixuan. ""It was such a positive experience and I formed so many invaluable relationships."" She now has three mentees she works with regularly. ""Every conversation is an opportunity to learn on both sides,"" she says, noting that mentorship is a two-way street.In addition to the personal fulfillment she gains from coaching colleagues and helping patients live healthier lives, there is one other, key reason Yixuan stays at Boston Scientific: ""Culture is everything,"" she says. ""When I officially became a citizen in 2017, my colleagues surprised me with a cake with a U.S. flag on it. This is one of many instances during my time here that I felt a strong sense of caring and belonging - that I am truly accepted for who I am as a person. It's a special feeling.""""It opened a door for me I didn't know existed""Like Yixuan, Corporate Accounts manager Katie Liao took advantage of the learning opportunities that come with belonging to an ERG. She moved from Taiwan to the U.S. as a teenager, and her personal experiences adapting to a new culture and business environment inspired her to join PEARL as a way to support others who are facing similar challenges.Katie came to Boston Scientific in 2004. ""From the moment I arrived, I experienced the inclusive culture firsthand,"" she says. ""There is no sense of hierarchy here; we are not bound by title or division. I always received the support I needed from leadership to try something new.""In addition to deepening her relationships with colleagues, PEARL helped Katie learn more about the business and career advancement opportunities. ""I recently stepped into a Corporate Accounts role that touches many parts of the Boston Scientific portfolio, whereas previously I focused on one area"" she says. ""Hearing about how other divisions are helping patients from my colleagues in PEARL piqued my interest and compelled me to make this transition, and I couldn't be happier in my decision. It opened a door for me I didn't know existed.""Similar to Yixuan, Katie is paying it forward with the mentorship she's received. She works with several professionals through the company's formal mentorship program, and is always willing to lend a listening ear to anyone who is seeking advice, whether career-related or personal.Katie's best piece of advice for those looking to advance at the company? ""Be your own advocate, and don't wait until your next role to do your best work,"" she says.She also stresses the importance of owning your career and finding mentors and sponsors across the company who will support your growth - a piece of advice she received from Mary Beth Moynihan, senior vice president of Market Access and Chief Marketing Officer. ""I've been fortunate to have so many mentors, allies and sponsors who built ladders for my career at Boston Scientific,"" says Katie. ""They played such an important role in where I am today.""Boston Scientific is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all of our employees can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive personally and professionally.

With that, I will turn the call over to JuE Wong.Story continuesJuE WongThank you, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This morning, we announced results for the first quarter of 2023 that were ahead of our expectations. And while we make progress, we know we have work to do to return the business to stronger growth. As discussed on our last earnings call, review 2023 as a reset year, during which we are taking actions intended to build a stronger and more resilient Olaplex. As I will explain in more detail shortly, during the quarter, we made progress on our priorities for the year, and we believe that we are implementing the appropriate actions for resetting the business. Yet we also recognize that there is still important work ahead of us. shifting market dynamics and macro uncertainties continue to reduce our visibility, and we remain in the early stages of this plan, achieving its intended results.That being said, we believe the fundamental strength of our business and the category remain and our confidence in our patent protected technology and the long-term potential for Olaplex are unchanged. Turning to a brief overview of the first quarter. Net sales of $113.8 million was slightly better than our guidance.As we previously communicated, our sales decline reflected a lower baseline level of consumer demand, the continued negative impact of customer inventory rebalancing efforts from certain Pro and speciality retail customers and a difficult comparison as we lap the sell-in of a successful launch into Ulta Beauty a year ago. Overall, all 3 channels were essentially in line with our outlook.Lower sales coupled with our strategic decision to spend in support of our future growth with important investments in sales and marketing, R&amp;D and workforce expansion led to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $50 million in the first quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44%. Notably, we believe the Olaplex brand remains healthy with consumers and stylists alike and our third-party external brand tracker showed consistently robust metrics through March.According to respondence of the survey, we continue to lead in premium hair care equity attributes ranking #1 or tied for #1 in 9 of the top 10, 15 equity statements while metrics on overall sentiment and trust in the Olaplex brand remains strong. Similarly, as evidence that our brand and technology differentiators continue to resonate with our communities, our product introductions launched during the first quarter are off to a strong start.In late January, we launched NO 4D clean volume detox dry shampoo on olaplex.com, in our prochannel and with Sephora. 4D detoxifies the scalp without clogging for and neutralizes older causing collusions without the traits of white residue. 4D Is performing well and has quickly become the #1 dry shampoo at Sephora and launches with our other specialty retail and DTC partners in early May. In late March, we entered our first haircare adjacency with the launch of Lashbond and eye lash enhancing serum universally formulated to promote the appearance of thicker, longer, stronger full volume lashes, formulated with a next-generation OLAPLEX peptide complex Lashbond is (inaudible) free and ophthalmologists tested. Lashbond is our first product to launch simultaneously across channels and the launch is off to a strong start with notable performance at Sephora in the U.S. as well as Space NK in the U.K. where Lashbond has already become a top 10 beauty SKU for the retailer.Before I discuss the progress made so far on our priorities, I think it's important to revisit why we are pursuing a reset here and the benefits we expect from the activities and initiatives we are implementing. Following several years of significant growth, we are pursuing this reset as we recognize the need to invest and expand our marketing and educational outreach and ensure we have the necessary tactics, talent and platform to realize the significant opportunity we see ahead for the Olaplex brand.Ultimately, we expect the benefits will be multifaceted and realized across the organization. At the heart of it all, we think our actions will enable continued growth in brand awareness and identities and ensure stylists and consumers are properly educated on the superior benefits of our technology. From an operations perspective, we expect the year will see us evolve our capabilities to enhance our agility, recalibrate and rightsize our inventory levels and continue executing against our new product developments pipeline. And importantly, we will continue to invest in our people, further building out our team and enhancing our culture. On our last earnings call, we introduced the priorities for a reset year that we believe will position us on a more solid footing. They include accelerating investments in sales and marketing, increasing and evolving our educational assets, reasserting our position with our Pro and retail partners and improving our approach to PR.Let me now walk you through the progress we made on these initiatives during the first quarter. Starting with sales and marketing. We continue to expect marketing inclusive of sampling and sales and marketing payroll to increase to $70 million in 2023 from $40 million in 2022. During the first quarter, we spent approximately $17 million. We are implementing a full funnel marketing approach this year. with an increase of marketing investment in strategies to generate awareness and support brand health and brand love. We have also allocated investments and deployed resources to convert customers to our brand. To that end, we are launching a new full funnel creative campaign intended to not only amplify our scientific authority and feature the transformative results from using our outstanding products, but also highlights emotional connections with our professional and consumer communities. The campaign kicks off later this month and includes digital social and out-of-home activations.We intend to measure the impact of this program as we go in order to optimize mix and spending as we progress through the year. We also continue to execute and enhance sampling program designed to expand trial, whereby we expect to deliver roughly 10 million samples in 2023. Strategic programs this year include distributing samples via oloplex.com, sampling in Sephora's buy online pick up in-store offering, and providing a #3 sample with any Olaplex service at Ulta beauty salons. Additionally, we intend to implement programs with international partners, including Sephora Europe and Dubai, making our first foray into sampling internationally. We are still in the early stages with this enhanced program but remain confident in our ability to acquire new users to the brand, given how successful sampling has been with conversion in the past.As it relates to education, our refreshed educational assets behind the core of our assortment with a focus around #3 are now being deployed, and we are pleased with the early feedback on the campaign. As a reminder, the goal of this work is to better educate stylists and consumers about how to use our core products, reinforce the benefits of our products with versatile usage and tips and introduce new claims and testimonials about the superiority of the results we deliver. Work is also underway to evolve and revamp our core educational curriculum for use across all channels and enhance the education content on our Pro website and app.From a leadership perspective, we are excited to announce that John Barone has joined us as our new Vice President of Global Education and Customer Experience. With over 35 years of experience in the professional stylist industry, John is highly regarded in the stylist community with deep expertise in beauty education, having served in various education roles with Aveda, Sebastian, Wella and Karl Salon. Turning to our efforts to reassert outstanding with our professional and specialty retail partners. For our Pro business, we continue to build our team in order to increase our frequency of contact with distributors, their sales teams and salons.We have accelerated planning with key distributors, creating joint business plans that include new initiatives and programs and working together to identify and pursue new business development opportunities and to enhance our partnership with prestige and opinion-leading salons. We have continued to enter new and nurture existing partnerships through our dedicated program, collaborating on digital and social content as well as high-profile events such as New York Fashion Week.Within specialty retail, we rolled out the third-party sale sales and education team trained by Olaplex into approximately 400 Sephora and Ulta Beauty retail store to directly engage with consumers and educate in-store beauty advisers. We are pleased with the program so far. We have shown a meaningful uplift in sales in participating doors and demonstrates the importance and influence Olaplex can have in driving in-person education.Internationally, we are happy with our continued expansion. We recently anniversaried our full fleet rollout with Sephora Europe and have partnered with the team to develop strategic marketing and education campaigns to drive further penetration with shoppers. With Douglas, a specialty retailer in Europe, we are rolling out into approximately 280 additional doors across Germany and the Netherlands, and we have partnered with [Duty Free] to launch our travel retail presence in 12 U.K. airports and expect to launch in additional countries over time.Our fourth priority this year is building out our PR capability. By leveraging our social channels, we have been proactively distributing content focused on correcting misinformation about Olaplex in the market. We launched a section on our website entitled Hair Health, which acts as a hub and a resource for consumers and stylists to assess accurate information about the size behind our products, our ingredients and tips for usage.Similarly, we are creating educational toolkits for our Pro and specialty retail channels to supply their employees with the necessary information and details to respond to and correct misperceptions about our brand. And lastly, we are engaging a group of leaders in dermatology to form the Olaplex Scientific Advisory Board comprised of medical and scientific experts. The Olaplex Scientific Advisory Board in partnership with our own internal team members will help Olaplex accomplish our mission of improving hair health through products and education for all of our customers.Underpinning our efforts this year is our continued focus on building upon our strong corporate culture with highly talented and passionate team members. To that end, we are excited to announce 2 new additions to our senior leadership team. John Kappler has been appointed Chief Revenue Officer, leading and overseeing the sales organization across all 3 of our channels. Prior to joining Olaplex, John served as the Head of U.S. and Global Sales at several consumer products companies across multiple categories.

In the first quarter of 2023, net sales declined 38.9% to $113.8 million versus $186.2 million last year. We believe that the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $21 million of year-over-year inventory rebalancing at certain key professional and specialty retail customers. Also, we faced a difficult comparison relative to the first quarter of 2022 when we shipped an additional $10 million of inventory pipeline to support our strong launch in Ulta. Supply channel, professional channel sales were slightly ahead of our expectations and declined 37.2% to $48.4 million versus a 62.6% increase last year. Specialty Retail sales decreased 45.8% to $34.9 million, following 102.5% growth in the prior year period. And our direct-to-consumer channel sales were down 31.9% to $30.5 million compared to a 15.1% increase last year.Geographically, international sales were flat for the quarter, while the U.S. was down 16.3%, with the impacts of customer inventory rebalancing and the lapping of the Ulta Beauty launch specifically impacting the U.S. Moving down the income statement. Adjusted gross profit margin was 72.6% declining 650 basis points from 79.1% in the first quarter of 2022. Approximately 250 basis points of this contraction reflects deleverage and inflation in our warehousing and distribution costs, 230 basis points related to higher inventory obsolescence reserve and 110 basis points from inflation on product costs, with the remainder from increased sampling and unfavorable customer mix.These more than offset the benefit of the price increase we took from July 1, 2022, and favorable channel mix. Adjusted SG&amp;A increased 59.6% to $32.9 million from $20.6 million in Q1 2022. The $12.3 million increase in adjusted SG&amp;A from prior year is primarily the result of an $8.6 million increase in sales and marketing expense to drive demand as well as an increase in payroll attributable to workforce expansion and other related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA declined 60.4% to $50 million versus $126.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44% compared to 67.9% a year ago. Adjusted net income decreased 65.7% year-over-year to $31.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share from $91.4 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the 2022 first quarter. Adjusted net income benefited from lower interest expense year-over-year due to our debt paydown and refinance in the first quarter of 2022 and higher interest income.Now turning to our balance sheet. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $132 million, down from $144.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter. The reduction in inventory levels was a result of our focus on aligning production levels to the new sales forecast, which more than offset building inventory of new SKUs as we prepared for product launches this year.Turning to cash flow. During the first quarter, we generated $48.1 million in cash from operations. As we shared in past calls, we anticipate another year of healthy cash generation as we maintain a high level of profitability and improve our working capital position, primarily through lower inventory. We ended the quarter with $369.3 million in cash and equivalents, which is generating interest income at a rate of 4% to 5%. Long-term debt, net of current portion and deferred fees was $653 million. Now turning to our financial outlook. The fiscal year 2023 guidance that we provided on our last earnings call is unchanged. Although we continue to operate in a dynamic environment with underlying macroeconomic uncertainty, our team delivered during the first quarter, and we are moving forward with the continued deployment of strategic investments to strengthen our market position.Let me walk you through our assumptions for the remainder of the year. Beginning with the second quarter, we now currently expect net sales will only modestly improve sequentially in absolute dollars compared to Q1 and remained down significantly compared to the year ago period. As a reminder, we are lapping 2 challenging comparators from Q2 2022.First, we will be lapping an approximately $22 million net sales impact in the second quarter of 2022 from the introduction of one leader size offerings in the North America professional channel, which we do not expect to offset in 2023. Second, in the second quarter of last year, we experienced some pull forward in demand as some professional customers chose to buy ahead of our announced price increases a year ago. Although the impact of this pull forward reverts in Q3, this results in a $10 million growth headwind in the second quarter of 2023. Also, we anticipate that the second quarter will continue to be impacted by the continuation of a lower baseline level of demand.Our increased investments in education, sales and marketing have recently been deployed and we expect to take time for these investments, particularly those in the upper funnel and other awareness building activities to generate improved consumer takeaway and have an impact on our shipments to customers. We expect the professional channel to be most challenged, partially due to facing a difficult comparison from last year's 1 liter launch and the pull forward impact from the price increases a year ago, followed by specialty retail.We believe the DTC channel will be the least impacted. In terms of profitability, due to timing shifts of sales and marketing spend into the second quarter, we expect that the second quarter will be a heavier marketing investment quarter, and therefore, we now believe the most adjusted EBITDA margin contraction of the year will occur in Q2. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect both net sales and profit trends to improve as we expect to more fully benefit from the net impact of new product introductions and additional distribution gains that are strategic and build brand equity. We also expect to benefit from an improvement in baseline demand as our increased investments in education, sales and marketing begin to yield returns.You will see that this implies improvement in the back half compared to the first half, ultimately leading to growth in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2024. Taken together, for fiscal year 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $563 million to $634 million, adjusted net income in the range of $176 million to $224 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $261 million to $322 million.Turning to adjusted gross margin. We continue to anticipate a 300 to 400 basis point decline in gross margin for the year due to inflation in warehousing and distribution costs and deleverage from lower sales volumes. This more than offsets the positive impact of cost savings and price increases implemented in the second half of 2022.In the medium term, we believe that we can return closer to our historical adjusted gross margin levels in the mid-70% range as we work through higher costs, inventory obsolescence impacts and as baseline demand improves. Given the confidence in our long-term strategy, we are continuing to invest for the long-term health of the business.We expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 46.4% to 50.8% for 2023, down from 16.9% last year. As I mentioned earlier, we now believe the most adjusted EBITDA margin contraction will occur in Q2. We believe adjusted EBITDA margin rate will improve in the second half relative to the first half as an improvement in the top line drives operating leverage. We continue to expect interest expense to be $40 million and adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the year.And as I mentioned last quarter, we anticipate another year of healthy cash generation in 2023 as profitability levels remain high, and we improve our working capital position. In summary, we are in the early stages of our reset year, but remain committed to improving the business and taking the necessary actions to enable the next phase of growth for Olaplex.We are deploying initiatives that have been successful for us in the past. And while we believe it may take time for investment to have an impact, we are confident we have the right strategies in place for improving demand. With our competitive differentiators, execution of our priorities, A solid balance sheet, high profitability and strong cash generation, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the near-term headwinds and emerge in an even stronger position. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first questions come from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.Olivia Tong CheangI wanted to ask you 2 questions. First, on promotion. Clearly, promotions been picking up. So can you talk about to what extent this has been driven by you versus the retailers? And at least obviously seen some products ending up in channels you probably didn't intend. So can you talk about what actions you're taking to control that? And then you mentioned getting gross margin back to somewhere in the mid-70s. If you could talk about the drivers to get back there, that would be helpful, too.JuE WongThanks, Olivia, for the question. What I will do is I'll take the promotion question and then have Eric comment on the diversion and the gross margin question. So I just want to be very clear, when we participate in promotion, we have said it before that we do promotions to really acquire new customers to the brand as well as allowing our loyal customers to buy deeper into the brand.And so as such, we partner with retailers on some of their promotions that really drive those goals that we have with them. So you've seen us in participation with Sephora in BI. But then we don't do anything that is off the curve that doesn't drive those kind of programming. So hopefully, that answers your question because what we want to be very clear again to double down is that we just don't do promotions indiscriminately for the sake of just driving sales.Eric TizianiThanks JuE. I'll take your question on diversion first. So just to be clear, Olaplex has not changed the selling model. We do not sell our products into grocery stores or other mass retailers. When we find products in unauthorized channels, we thoroughly investigate who supplied those products and take commercial and legal actions to prevent further diversion.We use tools on our products like QR codes. And I would just say that sadly, diversion is a problem that all consumer products, manufacturer space, especially in beauty and fashion. And we're striving to minimize those opportunities for diversion. Based on the tracking we've been able to monitor, we believe the overall diverted volume in these channels remains relatively small. And your next question was on gross margin and getting to the mid-70s adjusted gross margin and what are the drivers of that? I would just say, as we return to growth, we expect volume leverage to help on the fixed cost component of that, specifically our fixed warehousing cost. Also, as we continue to work our own inventory levels down to our target levels that lowers those warehousing costs and enabled us actually worked through some of the higher cost inventory in our system and realize some of the benefits we're seeing in a more stable supply chain environment with costs coming down. And the last thing and the last driver there is the savings initiatives that we're putting in forward through our Fuel for Growth program, we see efficiency opportunities that we think can support adjusted gross margin at that level in the medium term.Olivia Tong CheangIf I could just follow up one quick question, just early read-throughs on the last serum product and how that influences your decision-making around expanding beyond (inaudible).JuE WongThanks, Olivia. I'll take that question on Lash. So Lash is off to a great start, as you have heard from our call just now. And what is encouraging as it validates that our technology can actually play in adjacency. So we will continue to monitor the success of it and how it's doing. And as we have said before, our technology has cross-category benefits and opportunities, whether it's in skin care or nail care. So this is a great example of us having permission to play in an adjacent category having been have already been the top 10 beauty SKU at base NK in the U.K. and also a strong seller at Sephora.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.Robert Edward OttensteinGreat. A couple of questions. First and perhaps most important, obviously, the demand for the core products, the repeat purchases there. is an issue and there's a lot of possibilities, right? There's been the misinformation in social media that's been horrible. You've cited in the past competition you did a price increase.We don't know to what extent that had an impact. So just -- and I know it's really hard to be precise on this, but if you could kind of give us your best sense of kind of the 2 or 3 drivers that have been most impactful on the base level of demand of the core products. And whether over the quarter and into April now if you're starting to see any abatement in any of those negative factors. So that would be my first question.JuE WongOkay. Thanks, Robert, for that question. Let me take that. And then, Eric, if you want to add any or build on it, please do so. So first and foremost, we don't believe that price increase is a driver. In fact, we believe that it's a combination of factors, whether it's the macro environment, some more entrants into the space, higher level of discounting in the industry and some of the misinformation about our brand. But from the data we have seen in terms of sell-out trends, we have seen a stability since we reported last quarter, and we expect it to continue to do so. And that is because of all the execution that we are putting through in both sales and marketing, that includes people in store, the education, the sampling. So to answer your question as to what is the reason there is a combination of factors, as I've mentioned, but we are addressing that with the education, with the people in store, with a sampling program, with a more assertive PR program to correct the narrative that you are hearing that is a misinformation in the marketplace. And Eric, do you want to build on anything?Eric TizianiNo, you said that, Julie, I would just echo we've seen sellout trends stable since our last call, and we're assuming improvement in that trend based on our actions and investments into the second half of the year.Robert Edward OttensteinGreat. So you're seeing some traction there. That's great. And then shifting over to the international how can you -- just give me a little bit more detail in terms of your ability to get more distribution internationally? I know you mentioned you're going into some more Douglas stores.When I was in Europe, your product is just selling off the shelf and Sephora and it was incredibly well placed and well positioned. So in that context, it's a little surprising that you're not up and doing better internationally given the still low levels of distribution and the more earlier stage in the brand's development. So perhaps you could give us a little bit more sense of what's going on in Europe.JuE WongSo let me just take that. We have said that in 2023 is our reset year. So what we want to do is to really go deeper with our existing distribution and therefore, anniversarying Sephora in Europe, adding 280 doors to Douglas are part of that strategy so that we can be an anchor brand and a brand that truly delivers performance when it comes to not only in the products but also in the revenue driving for those retailers.In terms of international, again, you can see there are other geographies that we have not gotten ourselves into in a meaningful way. Weather is in Asia, in the Middle East, in Latin America, and those are really ripe for the picking because when they see how the brand penetrates and delivers in North America, in Western Europe, it really drives brand awareness, brand recognition and brand desire. So international is definitely a huge opportunity for Olaplex, but we want to continue to build that foundation to make our brand more resilient and stronger for now and for the future.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystThis is Blake on for Ashley. I wanted to ask on the professional channel. If you could comment any more on how that trended throughout the quarter and just how those customers how are they buying their inventory in terms of closer to need. Also maybe comment on time between salon visits if you've seen a change there from the end consumer as well. That's my first question.Eric TizianiYes, we've seen a consistent trend in the professional channel as what we've said in the previous quarter, which is that we do believe the current macro environment is impacting the professional channel and the stylist community a little bit more than what we've seen in other channels that is increasing the time between visits. We see that in data like what we get from Klein in measuring front of salon sales, which in the fourth quarter of last year was actually down -- the market was down 9%. So we've seen that continue, and we expect that to continue in 2023. That's balanced by the other channels.And I'll just put it in that context, we've always said that this is a category that is strong and resilient in the face of macro challenges. We expect that to continue, but not immune. And our expectation, at least as we aggregate what we see in retail and direct-to-consumer and Pro is more a category growth this year that would be in the mid-single-digit growth. So a slowdown, like I said, resilient but not immune to the macro uncertainty?Unidentified AnalystThat's helpful. And then on the guidance, I think I might have missed it, but I heard you say you expect positive growth year-over-year in Q4, did you mention your expectations for Q3 at all versus Q4? Just trying to think about the magnitude of difference in growth between Q3 and Q4.Eric TizianiWe didn't comment specifically on Q3. We've said that we expect to return to growth in the fourth quarter of this year as we believe the actions, the investments that we're taking, we're going to test, learn and optimize. Those impacts are going to build gradually quarter-by-quarter as we get through the year. And as we exit the year and as we have some more favorable laps admittedly as well in the fourth quarter, we expect growth to return in the fourth quarter as we enter 2024.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.Jason M. EnglishLet's pick up where you just left off, growth sales returning to growth by the fourth quarter. What gives you confidence in that? And how much of this distribution related -- what do you expect from accounts where you're currently distributed like US or the Protein in the U.S.? And what are the demand indicators you're seeing today that gives you confidence that you found a level that you can grow off of?JuE WongThanks, Jason, for that question. Let me start, and as usual, Eric has definitely built on it. I think first and foremost is the data that we have seen in our sell-out trends have been stable since we reported last quarter, and we expect that to continue to do so for the rest of the year. And why is that? Because we've been executing, as we've mentioned, on proven high return on investment, performance-based marketing that has been successful in the past. We have shared that, but we are going even further this year. And given that it's also our reset here. While it's too early on certain of our activation. But so far, what we have seen is our educational marketing support around our core that we just launched is showing really good signs of positive feedback both on the digital (inaudible) perspective as well as sales stability in the -- in our current and even new distribution that we have started late last year. With that said, the third-party field people in store continues to help us generate the ability to educate and to really get feedback as to what the consumers are misunderstanding so that we can really double click on our education content and material. Then there are other things that we are now going to expand such as the out-of-home campaign and our home advertising. And we have taken learnings very recently, late last year, early part of this year, where we had a Time Square billboard and they really directed traffic to the near in locations, which really shows that people were paying attention or consumers were paying attention. We do believe that something will continue to be successful, but that is early days, and retailers have come back and told us that they are going to give us feedback probably in Q3 or so because people who get the samples, they take time to try and then go back in store to convert. We are also starting more frequency contact with our pro community where it is not only about selling product knowledge information, but also helping them in their business so that they can actually benefit from us not only as a brand with products but a brand with a purpose.Jason M. EnglishOkay. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I heard you say your core mission, and I'm going to paraphrase because there was more different words around it, but core mission is to make people feel more confident with healthy air. We've talked in the past about the potential to maybe diversify into skin. Does this focus core mission, just imply just that, like you're really just going to focus on hair and we should ignore those type of adjacencies.JuE WongWell, the good news is you've seen us launch an adjacency in labor, right, and it has done well and continues to capture the imagination of the consumers, our retail partners, including our professional duty supply locations where they are actually asking more for the products. So we believe that our technology now validates the fact that it can be outside of where hair is. We want to focus on hair in this reset year because it is going deeper, not wider, but technology play is a big one in the marketplace. And when the time is right, where we have an intersection of cutting-edge technology and in a new segment that we can play in, then that is time for us to consider an adjacency of that nature because we have always said, it is not a question of needing to do it. It's a question of wanting to do something that is groundbreaking.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler.Korinne N. WolfmeyerSo first, I'd like to just touch on the guidance. I mean you left it unchanged, and it's still a pretty wide range for the year, and I understand it's a reset year, and we're still trying to figure out where things will settle out, but what would give you more confidence, say, in the coming quarters to start tightening that guidance?Eric TizianiKorinne, I'll take that one. As you just said, we're only one quarter into the reset year. We're in the early stages of implementing our plan, these actions and these investments. And as we've said, we're pleased with the progress thus far, and we're assuming that we're going to yield the benefits of those actions and investments in the back half of the year. To answer your question, as we traverse through the year, as we test, learn and optimize, as we see the impacts of those take hold, that's what would lead us to a position to tighten our range. We didn't feel like that was appropriate at this point.Korinne N. WolfmeyerGot it. And then just touching on some of the newer products, and I know you don't really disclose sales by product, but is there any color you could provide us on how much some of the newer products, like say, 4D have been contributing to sales? And then as we think about as you launch more adjacent products like Lashbond, that kind of different price points than that kind of $30 range that you typically sell at. How should we be thinking about the margin differential of those products? And if those become a bigger part of the mix, how should we be thinking about the margin impacts there?Eric TizianiKorinne, I'll take that one as well. So we just launched 4D, we've just launched Lash. I would just characterize these as similar type launches as what we've had in the past. Every subsegment of Lash in an adjacent category is those market sizes are different, and we'd say that the last serum category based on the numbers that we have is a smaller category, of course, relative to hair, but a meaningful opportunity and completely incremental to us. So similar size type launches.And from a margin perspective, it's not just the premium pricing, but it's the costs that go into that. Lash is a good example of something that is -- has the potential to help gross margins from an accretive gross margin impact. That one is a bit higher than our normal category margins, and that's going to continue to be an opportunity for us in the future as we evaluate with every launch that we put out into the market, what's the appropriate price.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Jungwon Kim with TD Cowen.Jungwon KimJust curious if you can elaborate a little bit more on how the sales progressed in specialty retail on a sort of a like-for-like basis? Are you seeing any sort of progress there? And if you can comment on sort of the marketing spend over the medium term, do you continue to expense the elevated levels that you are investing now? Or how should we think about that?Eric TizianiJungwon, I'll take that on specialty retail trends and then marketing as well. So you've seen our specialty retail results in the first quarter. Those were particularly depressed again by the lapping of the very successful launch that we had in Ulta in the first quarter of last year as well as some of this customer inventory rebalancing that we've said we also experienced in the first quarter. Specialty retail sellout trends have been stable since our last call. We'll recognize. You see the results in the first quarter that those have been -- that performance has been behind the category in the first quarter, again, as we lap that very, very successful launch in Ulta. And so stable since our last call and very much we assume that, that trend will improve in the back half on the back of our actions and investments. And you also asked about the marketing investments we're making as we said, Q2 has some additional investment against this upper funnel campaign that we're very excited about to build the brand, to build equity and to build awareness around the brand. We've consistently said we're going to test, learn and optimize and that's going to be part of it. We're excited about that campaign.OperatorOur final questions come from the line of Jonathan Keypour with Bank of America.Jonathan Daniel KeypourI'm just wondering -- in terms of how Olaplex goes to market, it seemed like maybe 2 years ago or a year ago to rely very heavily on the salon professional channel. And now that, that has slowed understandably. I'm just wondering if there is a kind of high-level shift in how OpEx is attempting to reach new consumers.JuE WongJonathan, thank you for the question, and I'll take that. So one of the things that we want to be really clear about is our stylist community is the bedrock of Olaplex. Continuous independent study shows that the #1 source of truth for consumers is recommendations by their head sites. We continue to enjoy their support they standing by us, and we continue to really develop relationships, business benefits for them. We are a brand with purpose for them, as I mentioned earlier. So we are going to be aware our consumers are. Our consumer are taking recommendations from their stylists. They are listening to their own family and friends. So verified product reviews are very important. That's where we are going to double-click on, making sure that our purchase verified product reviews are strong. And that is through sampling. We can actually give people samples, they can try the product and they can go on and buy the product and then leave a product review and the other one is family and friends.And this is why the social media aspect is so important because people go to social media platforms to really consume a lot of their product, learning and understanding. And so that's why they will double click on addressing narrative on educating about our products, helping people understand what are the benefits and the usage and tips. All this will add to the value of our brand and the receptiveness and the responsiveness to the brand. So in short, we are not making a change, but instead, we are investing more behind the brand to a full funnel marketing approach.Jonathan Daniel KeypourGreat. And then switching topics a bit. In terms of the inventory rebalancing, so you guys called out $21 million this quarter. I mean, I'm assuming that it gets that difference between sell-through and sell-in narrows over the course of the year. I'm just wondering if you could give us any kind of directional ideas about maybe what the full year rebalancing impact will be maybe how to sequence that through our models? And then if you can, I guess, where that impact is most pronounced by channel? And that should be good.Eric TizianiJonathan, absolutely. I'll take that. So let me just start by saying we have good visibility into inventory levels at most of our major U.S. accounts by item, and we're tracking sell-out versus sell-in for the majority of our global business. You mentioned the $21 million year-over-year impact that we believe we experienced in the first quarter. We also -- on our last call, I talked about the impact that we expect to lap in the fourth quarter of this year, which should be a positive. And so look, what is customer inventory rebalancing, all it is, as it relates to customers adjusting orders to align with sellout trends with macro conditions and their own decisions on month levels. And so we're tracking and monitoring that closely. It's dynamic. It happens every quarter to some extent on various items at various accounts, and we're factoring all of that into our current outlook into the guidance that we've provided. And as we've said, we've seen the sellout trend stabilize since our last call and assuming improvement in the back half.OperatorThank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to hand the call back over to JuE Wong for any closing comments.JuE WongThank you. Thank you, everyone, and we look forward to seeing everyone again at our next earnings Thanks. Bye.OperatorThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.]"

The company had posted a loss of $2.32 per share in the year-ago period.CRISPR Therapeutics' total revenues, comprising collaboration revenues, were $100 million in the first quarter, primarily attributed to an upfront payment from Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.In March, CRSP and VRTX entered a new non-exclusive licensing agreement to accelerate the development of the latter’s hypoimmune cell therapies for type I diabetes using the former’s gene-editing technology.Revenues substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $38 million and $1 million, respectively. In the year-ago quarter, revenues were less than $1 million.Post the announcement of the first-quarter results, CRISPR Therapeutics’ shares rose in after-market trading on May 8. The stock has gained 37.6% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s fall of 4.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Quarter in DetailFor the reported quarter, research and development expenses fell 15% year over year to $99.9 million, driven by reduced variable external research and manufacturing costs.Also, general and administrative expenses dipped 20% to $22.4 million due to a decline in external professional costs.Collaboration expenses for the first quarter reached $42.2 million, up 38% year over year. This significant gain was attributed to a rise in the company’s manufacturing and pre-commercial costs on the exa-cel program (being developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals).As of Mar 31, 2023, CRISPR Therapeutics had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.88 billion compared with $1.87 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.Pipeline UpdateCRISPR Therapeutics has developed exa-cel — an investigational ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy for treating sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) — in partnership with Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Story continuesIn April, with partner Vertex, CRISPR Therapeutics completed the rolling biologics licensing application (BLA) submission with the FDA, seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications. The companies started the BLA submission in November 2022.The companies also filed similar regulatory applications on exa-cel in European Union and the U.K. in December 2022, which were validated by the European Medicines Agency, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in January 2023.Apart from exa-cel, CRISPR Therapeutics is developing two chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy candidates — CTX110 and CTX130 — for hematological and solid-tumor cancers.The company has been enrolling patients in the phase II study evaluating CTX110 in relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. CRISPR Therapeutics is also enrolling patients in the ongoing phase I COBALT-LYM study evaluating CTX130 targeting CD70 for the treatment of T cell lymphomas.The company is advancing several next-generation CAR-T product candidates, namely CTX112 targeting CD19 antigen and CTX131 targeting CD70 antigen. These candidates have been designed to enhance CAR-T potency. The company has initiated clinical studies on both candidates, following the clearance of their investigational new drug application by the FDA in February 2023.CRISPR Therapeutics also announced plans to advance its lead in the vivo program, CTX310, into clinical development later this year. The candidate has been designed to target angiopoietin-related protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which is responsible for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.CRISPR Therapeutics AG Price and EPS Surprise CRISPR Therapeutics AG Price and EPS SurpriseCRISPR Therapeutics AG price-eps-surprise | CRISPR Therapeutics AG QuoteZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCRISPR Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Ocuphire Pharma OCUP and Allogene Therapeutics ALLO.

356,769395f6-fa24-3a94-b52e-d5c373c5da39,NSC,2023-05-10,Norfolk creates fund to offset loss of home value near wreck,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-creates-fund-offset-loss-115551156.html,1683719751,STORY,['NSC'],"[A Senate committee on Wednesday approved a rail-safety bill introduced after the derailment of a freight train in East Palestine, Ohio, but its fate remains uncertain due to significant Republican opposition.The bill would increase inspections of trains carrying hazardous materials, require the use of technology to detect track defects, and sharply raise penalties on railroad companies for crashes.The Senate Commerce Committee advanced the bill one day after Norfolk Southern renewed a promise to create a fund for residents near the site of the Ohio train wreck to cover any decline in home values since the February derailment.Norfolk Southern Corp. CEO Alan Shaw said in a letter to committee members that the railroad expects to compensate homeowners within about 5 miles (8 kilometers) of the crash if they sell their homes for less than the property was appraised before the derailment. He said the railroad expects to start making payments within a year.On Feb. 3, 38 railcars derailed in East Palestine, 11 of which carried hazardous chemicals, with some spilling into nearby waterways. Half of the town's 5,000 residents were evacuated as emergency responders burned off chemicals to prevent an uncontrolled explosion.Images of the black smoke and stories about families forced to leave their homes led lawmakers to call for action to improve rail safety. The bill that emerged was approved by the Senate panel on a 16-11 vote, with all but two Republicans opposing the measure.One of those Republicans supporting the bill, J.D. Vance of Ohio, argued that the measure is necessary to stem an increase in rail accidents.“There will be another East Palestine in this country if we do not pass the Railway Safety Act. It’s that simple,” Vance said. “Yes, it may make rail transportation a little bit more expensive, but it's going to make rail transportation a little bit more expensive in the service of safety.”But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the bill would give too much power to the Biden administration to restrict rail shipments of coal, oil and other fossil fuels “that the radical green movement hates.”Story continuesVance and Republican Eric Schmitt of Missouri joined all the committee Democrats in voting for the bill.Cruz said the bill is unlikely to get the 60 votes it probably would need to pass on the Senate floor, or to win passage in the GOP-controlled House, unless changes are made to restrict the administration's rulemaking power over railroads.The bill has been the subject of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes to the original version introduced by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.Ian Jefferies, president of the Association of American Railroads, said those negotiations have improved the bill, but “challenges remain with certain provisions,” including a requirement for at least two crew members on each train.In his letter late Tuesday to committee members, Norfolk Southern CEO Shaw said that while the company has accrued nearly $400 million in charges for the derailment, that doesn’t include compensation for falling property values, long-term health care or water treatment. It also does not reflect payments the railroad will receive from insurance.Shaw said Cruz encouraged him to write the letter, which contained more details around homeowner compensation than the company had previously provided. “This commitment demonstrates that, as Senator Cruz and others have indicated, Norfolk Southern understands that this derailment was not the fault of the people of East Palestine,” the CEO said.The federal government, the state of Ohio and residents near the crash have all filed lawsuits against Norfolk Southern.Shares of Norfolk Southern Corp., based in Atlanta, rose a fraction of a penny in trading Wednesday.]"

359,983b67d0-44eb-355e-90fc-a2e881612fbe,KO,2023-05-10,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-110024847.html,1683716424,STORY,['KO'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Coca-Cola implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Coca-Cola. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Coca-Cola's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Coca-Cola. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 7.2% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Coca-Cola Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.8b worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 9.2% of the Coca-Cola shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Coca-Cola , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

360,1e385000-d77d-3597-aa60-aceb7ebd2e0e,KO,2023-05-10,Here is What to Know Beyond Why CocaCola Company (The) (KO) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cocacola-company-130001494.html,1683637201,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share, indicating a change of +2.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 points to a change of +4.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $11.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.3%. The $44.96 billion and $47.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Inc., The Coca-Cola Co. and T-Mobile US, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Mastercard shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). The company's numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry's gain of +10.3%. The company's earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO's results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of T-Mobile US have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%).

MetzgerThank you, Sharon, and thank you all for joining the webcast. I want to also welcome Dr. Neil Gallagher to the call today as our new President and Head of R&amp;D. Neil is a highly accomplished oncology drug developer and has deep experience across all stages of drug development and strong track record of successful drug approvals, will be instrumental in driving continued pipeline development and growth at Syndax. You will hear from Neil later in the call.We also welcome Kevin McManus to the company as our new Chief People Officer. We look forward to benefiting from his extensive experience and vision in building our organization and culture.Now, turning to Slide 3, where we provide a high level summary of our current corporate priorities. Throughout the first quarter, we continued to execute on our clinical and corporate strategy. We are confident in our ability to deliver pivotal readouts and registration filings for our 2 lead drug candidates later this year. We are on the cusp of realizing the potential of our science by delivering treatments that provide critical benefit to patients where there is significant unmet medical need.Diving into revumenib, our highly selective menin inhibitor. Our pivotal Phase 2 AUGMENT-101 trial evaluating revumenib in patients with relapsed refractory NPM1-mutant or KMT2A rearranged acute leukemia is progressing well. We expect to report data from KMT2A rearranged acute leukemia patients in the AUGMENT-101 pivotal trial in the third quarter of this year, which could serve as the basis for our U.S. regulatory filing by year-end.We have several additional trials ongoing designed to expand the potential of revumenib beyond use as a monotherapy agent in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, including combinations with standard-of-care regimens to treat these forms of acute leukemia, and we expect to have initial data from several of them by the year-end. I will provide details on each of these trials later in the call.Moving to Axatilimab, our antibody against CSF-1R. We remain on track to report topline data in mid-2023 from the pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with chronic graft versus host disease, or cGVHD, and plan to submit a BLA filing by the end of 2023. With Incyte, we have the support of a strong pharmaceutical partner to help us advance the development of Axatilimab and successfully commercialize once approved.Other trials that we expect to initiate this year include a Phase 1/2 combination trial of Axatilimab and Jakafi in cGVHD led by our partner, Incyte, as well as a Phase 2 trial of Axatilimab in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. that will be led by Syndax. As we prepare to become a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company delivering 2 best-in-class products to patients in areas of high unmet medical need, we continue to take a disciplined and thoughtful approach to building our organization with highly experienced and talented people.We are well-funded with $449 million in cash as of March 31. Our cash balance enables us to expand beyond our core registration indications and provides us flexibility to selectively pursue business development opportunities. As part of that effort, we continue to evaluate earlier stage targeted oncology compounds for potential in-licensing. We believe that we have sufficient resources to acquire new early-stage assets that have the potential to become high value differentiated drug. But we have, as we have conveyed, a high bar for doing so as any compound would need to complement our current pipeline and align with our long-term corporate strategy.Let's now turn to Slide 4, and I'll provide further details on the revumenib program. The Phase 2 portion of AUGMENT-101 was designed as 3 single-arm pivotal trials with distinct patient populations that enroll independently. These populations include KMT2A-rearranged ALL, KMT2A-rearranged AML and NPM1-mutant AML. The primary endpoint of each is the percentage of patients achieving CR/CRH with secondary endpoints, including durability of CR/CRH response, transfusion independence, overall survival and safety. Patients who undergo transplant also have the opportunity to be retreated with revumenib in the Phase 2 portion, which could be an important maintenance option for these patients, given that they are at high-risk of relapse.Based on the broad breakthrough therapy designation we received in December 2022 and conversations with regulators, we will pool data generated from the AML and ALL KMT2A cohorts into a single NDA filing aimed at an indication to treat adult and pediatric relapsed/refractory acute leukemia patients with a KMT2A rearrangement. We expect to provide topline data from this pool population in the third quarter of this year and plan to file an NDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory KMT2A acute leukemia in adult and pediatric patients by the end of 2023. Separately, we continue to enroll relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML patients and expect completion of enrollment of this cohort in the second half of 2023.I'm happy to report that in the first quarter we completed the clinical pharmacology work that supports the recommended Phase 2 dose in any patient eligible for revumenib. We have determined the RP2D in patients who are not on a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 276 milligrams every 12 hours and now have agency agreement on including this dose in AUGMENT-101. This means that any patient can be treated with revumenib, whether or not they're receiving concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors. We would expect this dose to be incorporated into the revumenib label at the time of approval.Moving to Slide 5. We are excited to now have the Phase 1 AUGMENT-101 data published in Nature. The work lays out the biology of revumenib and provides a thorough review of the data. In these heavily pretreated patients who have received a median of 4 prior therapies, 30% of the efficacy-evaluable population experienced the CR/CRH with an impressive median duration of CR/CRH response of 9.1 months as of the data cutoff date. The authors concluded that revumenib monotherapy was associated with encouraging clinical benefit, including deep molecular remissions and durable responses with minimal toxicities in this heavily pretreated patient population.Turning to Slide 6. Based on revumenib's compelling efficacy and safety profile, our clinical strategy is to expand beyond the relapsed or refractory setting into earlier settings and post-transplant maintenance as well as explore the combination of revumenib with approved therapies. We believe that revumenib could become the backbone of treatment for patients with KMT2Ar and NPM1-mutant acute leukemias and by unlocking the full potential of revumenib, meaningful value would be added.There are currently no FDA-approved therapies targeting KMT2Ar or NPM1 acute leukemias, a population that together represent up to 40% of AML patients. Including the expansion opportunities, we see the potential to address upwards of 12,000 NPM1-mutant and KMT2Ar acute leukemia patients across various settings. Because of this significant unmet medical need, we are committed to bringing encouraging clinical benefits to even more patients.Here we highlight our ongoing trials of revumenib across the treatment landscape. Starting with the Phase 1 BEAT-AML umbrella trial. As part of our collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, revumenib is being combined with venetoclax and azacitidine to treat newly diagnosed AML patients within NPM1-mutant or KMT2A rearrangement, who are unfit for induction chemotherapy. Revumenib is the first menin inhibitor to be included in this trial, which will assess safety as well as initial efficacy. Enrollment is ongoing and we expect to report initial safety data from the trial by year-end 2023. Longer-term, we expect that positive BEAT-AML trial results could lead to a Phase 2/3 trial which could serve as the basis for our future regulatory filings.We are also currently enrolling patients in the AUGMENT-102 trial designed to assess revumenib in combination with standard salvage chemotherapies for patients with relapsed or refractory NPM1-mutant or KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemias. We expect to reach a recommended Phase 2 dose and report initial data from this trial in 2023. And the INTERCEPT trial continues to enroll patients as part of the Master Clinical Trial led by the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group.The trial is a creative approach to treating patients early in their disease course as it is focused on investigating novel therapies to target early relapse and clonal evolution as preemptive therapy in AML. It is designed to explore the activity of revumenib, the first menin inhibitor to be included in this master trial as monotherapy in patients with NPM1-mutant or KMT2A-rearranged AML, who have MRD-positive disease following initial treatment, a group of patients at very high risk of relapse. Data from this trial could also provide additional support for use of revumenib in a maintenance setting. We also plan to initiate a trial of revumenib in combination with standard-of-care intensive chemotherapy known as 7+3 in the frontline setting in the second half of this year.Turning to Slide 7. Beyond the market opportunity that we outlined here in acute leukemias, we are also exploring the use of revumenib as a treatment in solid tumors based on compelling preclinical signs supporting the role of the menin-MLL1 interaction in beta-catenin driven tumors. Enrollment is going well in our proof of concept signal-seeking Phase 1 trial in metastatic colorectal cancer and we expect to have initial data from this trial by year-end 2023.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Neil to briefly talk about chronic graft versus host disease and why we believe axatilimab are potentially best-in-class monoclonal antibody therapy targeting the CSF-1 receptor could benefit patients diagnosed with this disease. Neil?Neil GallagherThank you, Michael. It's a pleasure to be part of the Syndax team and to showcase today why we're so excited about the AGAVE-201 topline data that we expect to be able to share in the middle of the year.Turning to Slide 8. There are approximately 14,000 patients living with chronic GVHD in the U.S. today. While there are a number of recently approved agents that have brought benefits to patients suffering from the disease, there remains a significant unmet medical need across all lines of therapy. Following initial treatment with corticosteroids, patients are usually cycled through a variety of therapies, all of which are associated with high failure rates. Consequently, chronic GVHD remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among patients following transplant. Based on the Phase 1/2 data, which I'll summarize shortly, we believe axatilimab provide a differentiated, effective and practice-changing intervention for this underserved population.In Slide 9, I would like to give some background on the disease pathology and the essential role that monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play in chronic GVHD. The activation, proliferation and survival of these macrophage populations is regulated through CSF-1 receptor. Once localized to tissues where active disease is occurring, macrophages may take on either a pro-fibrotic or a pro-inflammatory role, depending on localized signaling factors. Therefore, attenuation of CSF-1R receptor signaling using blocking antibodies such as axatilimab is expected to reduce circulating monocytes and derived macrophages, and consequently reduce disease pathophysiology.The differentiated mechanism of action of axatilimab combining anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity holds the promise to provide a new therapeutic option for chronic GVHD patients, distinct from other approved therapies. The mechanism of CSF-1R blockade also offers the potential for improving the outcomes of patients with chronic GVHD when combined with other currently used therapies.Based on encouraging preclinical data, we conducted a Phase 1/2 trial of axatilimab in patients with chronic GVHD. The results of the trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology last fall and are summarized in Slide 10. Patients included in the study were heavily pre-treated with a median of four4 prior therapies. Among patients treated in the Phase 2 portion of the trial, the overall response rate by cycle 7 day 1 was 82% with a median time to respond to 4 weeks. At the time of data cutoff, the median duration of exposure to axatilimab was 38 weeks and the median duration of response have not yet been reached.Importantly, clinical responses were accompanied by a reduction in chronic GVHD symptom burden. Axatilimab demonstrated a manageable safety profile in this refractory population, and the most common adverse events reported were consistent with on-target effect of CSF-1R inhibition.These encouraging data that I just described prompted us to initiate the AGAVE-201 trial, the design of which is summarized on Slide 11. This is a pivotal dose-ranging trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with chronic GVHD. Enrollment criteria for AGAVE-201 was similar to the Phase 1/2 trial reported on the prior slide. The trial enrolled 240 patients whose disease had progressed after 2 prior therapies, were at least 2 years of age and met all other eligibility criteria. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups, each investigating a distinct dose of axatilimab administered either once every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint is overall response rate by cycle 7 day 1 using the 2014 NIH consensus criteria for chronic GVHD. Secondary endpoints include duration of response and validated quality of life assessments using the modified Lee Symptom Scale.We are looking forward to being able to report topline data from the AGAVE-201 trial in mid-2023, and anticipate making a regulatory filing in relapsed or refractory chronic GVHD by year-end 2023. Our partner, Incyte, will be leading the regulatory activities as laid out in the terms of our collaboration agreement.And with that, I'll turn the call back to Michael. Michael?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Thank you, Neil. Just to round out this section, let me briefly turn to Slide 12, which highlights the broad clinical and commercial opportunity for axatilimab. The successful commercial launches of Incyte's Jakafi and Sanofi's Rezurock speak to the unmet medical need in cGVHD that translates to a large commercial opportunity.We believe axatilimab has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit in chronic GVHD patients refractory to multiple prior therapies. Through combinations in earlier settings as well as the opportunity to expand to the U.S. markets, we envision that axatilimab could create significant additional value in cGVHD. We are looking forward to expanding the axatilimab program to include a Phase 1/2 combination trial with Jakafi in cGVHD. The trial will be led by Incyte and is expected to begin in the second half of 2023.Beyond cGVHD, we are also excited about the opportunity to expand Axatilimab into fibrotic diseases such as IPF, where the monocytes macrophage lineage plays a key role. At this point, I want to highlight that Axatilimab benefit in lung manifestations of cGVHD will be the focus of an oral session at the American Thoracic Society Conference on May 24. The presentation details the 15 patients in the Phase /2 trial that had cGVHD related bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or BOS per the 2014 NIH cGVHD consensus criteria.8 of these patients demonstrated a partial response and no patients experienced BOS progression as might be expected in the absence of an active therapy. We believe these data support Axatilamab's therapeutic potential in interstitial lung diseases such as IPF, where we intend to initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2023.I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our financial results. Keith?Keith Alan GoldanThank you, Michael. Let me take a few minutes to discuss our financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Turning to Slide 13. The results of our operations for the first quarter of 2023 and the comparison to prior year's quarter are included in our press release, so we won't repeat them in these remarks. Additional financial details are available in our first quarter 2023 report, which was filed earlier today on Form 10-Q.I'd like to point out that our net loss for the first quarter was $41.1 million or $0.59 per share compared to a net loss of $37.2 million or $0.63 per share for the comparable period last year. This difference in our net loss was driven largely by an increase in employee-related expenses as well as professional fees within both SG&amp;A and R&amp;D.We ended the first quarter with $449 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities and 69.6 million shares and prefunded warrants outstanding. Our current cash is expected to provide runway into the second half of 2025, which allows us to appropriately invest to maximize the value of our pipeline, prepare for two potential U.S. commercial launches in 2024, and pursue potential business development activities to build our pipeline.Looking ahead, I'd like to provide financial guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2023. For the second quarter, we expect research and development expenses to be $38 million to $43 million and total operating expenses to be $53 million to $58 million. For the full year of 2023, the company continues to expect R&amp;D expenses to be $160 million to $175 million, and total operating expenses to be $225 million to $240 million, including approximately $30 million of noncash stock compensation expense.With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael.Michael A. MetzgerThank you, Keith. 2023 is an incredibly significant year for Syndax, and I'm confident that we have the expertise and resources to execute on our goals and on the strategic long-term vision that will allow us to successfully transition to a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company. In the near-term, we are focused on delivering quality data readouts for our pipeline and potential registrational filings in 2023 for our 2 lead drug candidates, both of which are first and potentially best-in-class treatments.Additionally, we continue to look for ways to capture the maximum value of our current pipeline by expanding into opportunities beyond the initial registration indications. Our goal is to bring the potentially encouraging clinical benefits of our lead candidates to even more patients.As always, I want to express our deep appreciation to the Syndax team, collaborators and most importantly, the patients, trial sites and investigators involved with our clinical programs. It is all of you who help us to execute on our mission of realizing a future in which people with cancer live longer and better than ever before. And I'd also like to thank our committed long-term investors who continue to share in our vision and support us in building Syndax.And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Madhu Kumar with Goldman Sachs.Madhu Sudhan KumarI want to start by thinking about AUGMENT-102, the salvage chemotherapy combo trial. So, as that moves forward, how do you envision using revumenib as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory leukemias versus in combination with chemotherapy?Michael A. MetzgerMadhu, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll turn it over to Neil to address that.Neil GallagherYes. So, I think the first approval of revumenib will be in the relapsed/refractory setting at [Momenta]. We have a number of different combination studies either ongoing or planned to enable us to execute this strategy of moving of expanding revumenib into other patient population in combination with chemotherapy. So, the combinations are really for earlier phase population or earlier-stage population ahead of what we anticipate will be the approved indication.Madhu Sudhan KumarOkay. And maybe on that -- thinking about the BEAT-AML frontline trial where you're going to have initial safety data at year-end, can you talk a little more about what specific adverse events you might be monitoring when thinking about a combination of revumenib with Ven/Aza? And I guess, particularly the question 1 can add, is there any reason to expect QT prolongation could be exacerbated in the combination setting relative to the monotherapy?Neil GallagherOkay. Thanks for the clarification, Madhu. So, yes, we're anticipating data from the BEAT-AML study with the combination trial, as you pointed out, Ven/Aza, emerging during the course of this year. We don't anticipate -- there's no reason to anticipate that that combination will not be feasible. It's just a matter of doing the normal dose ranging that we need to do. So, there's no technical reason to assume that we wouldn't be able to proceed into a larger base (inaudible) Phase 3 study in combination with [revumenib] versus Ven/Aza.Madhu Sudhan KumarI guess, maybe closing on that point, do you expect -- like how much dose reduction for both Ven/Aza and revumenib might 1 expect from the combination kind of given any preclinical work you all have done with the combination?Michael A. MetzgerWell, no, thanks again. I mean, preclinically you can't predict. I mean, we're doing the experiment to do the dose ranging and it will be -- just revisit me to speculate (inaudible). When we have the data, I mean, of course, we'll report them. They'll be reported publicly to discuss with them.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Eva Privitera with TD Cowen.Eva Xia PriviteraThanks for taking our questions. We've been getting some questions about the recent paper on resistance mechanisms that arise in around 40% of patients treated with menin inhibitors after a few cycles. How should we think about this phenomenon in the context of the high efficacy and the high MRD negativity rates that we've seen in the actual clinical trial?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Maybe I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Neil. Look, I think, the data that we've generated -- and Eva, thanks for the question. I think the data that's been generated obviously published in Nature really shows the efficacy of the molecule and the ability to generate remissions -- deep reemissions, MRD negative remissions in a large subset of patients, 30%. I think the idea being overall response rate of over 50%, we are seeing some mutations, and I think it's across all the menin inhibitor class we believe be affected by this.And I think, you had quoted up to 40%, I think it was a subset of our patient data. Important to note that the great efficacy that we're seeing in the population is really in the presence of some resistance. So, of course, some patients will have some resistance over time to all targeted therapies. This is not uncommon. It's been shown with all therapies even outside of menin inhibitors. The idea here is that we have a highly effective treatment, the ability to combine our agent and move it earlier in treatment is a step in the direction of treating patients as early as possible to potentially deal with the mutations that arise, but it's a small part of the population.And I think importantly, we feel that it's likely our baseline that these mutations were likely -- they were present and probably below the level of detection. And they are probably there, these are (inaudible) patients, so heavily pretreated and had received a lot of prior treatments. So, I think -- overall, I think we are feeling that our data is quite strong. We'll obviously be first to market and we'll have a great profile. I think, mutations arise with all these therapies and the ability to combine it, move it earlier in treatment will over time help us treat even more patients. So we're quite encouraged by the data and it's always good to be on the front-end of the science knowing that we have a molecule and we have the ability to understand kind of why some patients actually don't respond.Eva Xia PriviteraYes. And you mentioned moving to the earlier lines. How do you expect these resistance in mechanisms to impact the use in the front-line setting in combo with other agents, and also perhaps in the maintenance setting?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Eva, let me ask Neil to respond to that.Neil GallagherYes. So, as Michael touched on, our working hypothesis is that a lot of these mutations are actually present at baseline, but remain below the limit of detection. And so, just to reiterate a little bit, we don't anticipate any change from what we've already reported that the mutation data were derived from the same study that we reported clinical data on with the median duration of response of 9 months.Importantly, also remember that 80% of patients who had CR/CRH had MRD negative. This is incredibly important from a therapeutic perspective in very heavily pretreated patient population. As Michael also alluded to, obviously we're at the forefront of the science here where we understand it. We're learning more about it, but we understand it to a large extent. And we absolutely believe that moving to earlier lines of therapy quickly, which is what we're planning to do during the course of 2024 and actually are laying down the plans for doing that with the combination studies that we just described a little bit earlier, that moving into earlier lines of therapy is important. So -- because we also believe that combining revumenib with standards of care in earlier lines of therapy is more likely to eradicate any clones that exist already and also to preclude the emergence of resistant clones on [therapy].OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.Anupam RamaJust thinking about both the KMT2A data coming from AUGMENT-101 in the third quarter and the future readout for NPM1. How do we think about how much sort of post-maintenance or post-transplant maintenance data we might get from both sort of near-term and long-term from these cohorts?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Anupam, thanks for the question. Look, I think the data suggests that -- or at least the data from Phase 1 suggests a lot of patients are going to transplant and certainly the ones that had reached an MRD negative response up to 40% or so had moved on to transplant. I think that's a number that's rarely seen in targeted therapy. And so, I would expect -- and based on the change in the protocols, in the Phase 1, we weren't permitted to put patients back on therapy or they weren't permitted to go back on therapy. That's a significant change between the Phase 1 and the Phase 2 where we have the ability to put patients back on after engraftment. They have the ability to go back on therapy that goes for KMT2A as well as NPM1 patients.And so, if you take that forward and relieve the tension point of not being able to go back on therapy, you should be seeing a high -- I would say a significant portion of patients who go on to get successful transplant to be eligible and go back on. So, I can't give you specific numbers, but I would say that this is an emerging paradigm in this field of relapsed/refractory disease. And so, we're excited to see what portion of the Phase 2 is in that camp. So, yes, time will tell.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Yigal Nochomovitz with Citigroup.Yigal Dov NochomovitzI just want to switch topics to axatilimab and AGAVE-201. Could you just spend a little bit of time talking about any differences in the patient populations between the Phase 1/2 and the AGAVE-201 trial? Are the 201 patients more heavily pretreated given the uptake of ruxolitinib and Rezurock? And then secondly, can you comment at all on what physicians and maybe even the regulators said with respect to study that's randomized but doesn't now have a control arm?Michael A. MetzgerYigal, thanks for the question. So, let me first start off with the differences in the patient populations or I should say the lack thereof. I think these are third-line plus patients. The Phase 1/2 that we enrolled and then read out last year had those patients in it. The patients that were enrolling in AGAVE-201 have the same patients. We did see patients who had prior ruxolitinib and also the Jakafi -- I'm sorry, the Rezurock drug. So, we are seeing patients in both trials that had prior -- significant prior therapies, including the newly approved ones. And so, we expect the patient populations to be quite similar.And then, your second question relates to just (technical difficulty). Yes, so as you point out in your -- implicit in your question is the fact that the trial is randomized, 3 doses, AGAVE-201 we're talking about. But it is, call it, single-arm. It's not -- it's randomized between the doses, but doesn't have a placebo arm. That is in fact true. I think, this is the design, very similar design to Rezurock, the trial that (inaudible) to get their drug approved, very similar. And obviously, we've had significant agency feedback and they've reviewed everything that we've done and we had alignment on that design. So we expect that this will lead to a full approval. It's not an accelerated approval, but it's a full approval. And of course, it's all dependent upon us having positive data and submitting a package. So, I think that's the easiest way to think about it. The design is sort of tried and true based on what others have done, and we're following what the agency has guided us to do.Yigal Dov NochomovitzOkay. Got it. And then, another important question which I'm sure you've thought about a lot is, your IV [Q2] week and obviously some of the other market participants are oral. Just talk a little bit about how you see that in terms of achieving strong uptake for axatilimab assuming you make it to market? Do you think that this could be a therapy that would be extended into the community practice as well as to the academic centers?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Thanks for the question, Yigal. I'm going to turn it over to Anjali and she is going to respond.Anjali GanguliYigal, thanks for the question. No, we're very -- we've gotten very strong feedback from physicians about the overall profile for axatilimab. It is an IV in a world of approved therapies that are oral, but many of the prior treatments that physicians have been using to control the disease included IV therapies as well as other very difficult-to-use treatments. And I think what really drives these physicians is, can I get this disease under control for my patients. The infusion for axatilimab is pretty straightforward, a 30-minute push infusion. And in the trial that we're running, physicians are able to change patients to a once monthly frequency after 6 months. And so, that may be an option for patients in the real world as well. We're also thinking about subcutaneous formulation that could alleviate some of these differences also.Yigal Dov NochomovitzAnd then, just 1 quick clarifying one, Mike, on (inaudible). I think you mentioned the 276 milligram you have that data. So, just to confirm, you don't need to do any more clinical work with that dose to obtain that label claim for that dose. Is that right?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Look, we had said several months ago that we were undertaking a pretty extensive clin pharm program which is necessary for filing. This was part of that set of work, the clin pharm work. And so we've enrolled a sufficient number of patients to generate the data that derives the dose that we talked about the 276. And so, we expect to enroll patients in the Phase 3 trial -- the Phase 2 trial, sorry, the approval trial AUGMENT-101 that has additional patients on a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. That'll be included ultimately in the registration filing. But in terms of actually having data to support what we need a 276 that have that in the label, we believe we have sufficient data.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Peter Lawson with Barclays.Peter Richard LawsonJust a follow-up around the number of patients that you would need to file without that strong CYP3A4 inhibitor?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Peter, thanks for the question. We haven't disclosed how many patients that is. I think we've said in the past we'll enroll a sufficient number which to justify the dose and we've done so, and we've talked to the agency and they've aligned with that. And so, we feel very confident that we have -- now we'll have a label, of course, the drug has to be approved, but the label will show that any patient will have the right dose at the right time.Peter Richard LawsonGot you. And then, I don't know if you've ever mentioned this. But have you seen responses in AML patients that have already failed another menin inhibitor?Michael A. MetzgerThanks for the follow-up. I don't think we've actually called that out in our dataset. And I don't know the actual answer to that. I mean, but we haven't specifically called out over our dataset. So it's a little hard for me to give you a specific answer, Peter.Peter Richard LawsonGot you. And then, just final question around axatilimab. On the bar for success for the [Rux] plus axatilamab for the first line or Phase 1 cGVHD combination trial. What do you think that is?Michael A. MetzgerI'm sorry. Can you repeat the last part again? What do I think what is exactly?Peter Richard LawsonThe bar for success what do you want to see?Michael A. MetzgerRight. Yes, it's a fair question. Maybe I'll turn it over to Neil to respond to that. I think we're talking about the Phase 2 trial, not the Phase 1 but the Phase 2 trial, yes.Neil GallagherI mean, this is being executed by the partner. And so, I would address the question to them. Ultimately, the strategy longer-term, it's going to be executed by Incyte actually. So, I think it would be probably better if you ask Incyte.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Kalpit Patel with B. Riley Securities.Kalpit R. PatelYes. Maybe a couple on axatilamab. In the topline readout, do you expect to show any -- I know it's topline readout, but do you expect to show any data on the durability for the 6 months or so follow-up results that you may have?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Kalpit, thanks for the question. Look, I think what we're -- we haven't disclosed what our -- what the actual data will -- the breadth of the data, I should say that we'll be disclosing on the topline. I think suffice to say, we'll endeavor to put enough data out that really speaks to the profile and allows people to have an accurate view on not only how the drug did in the trial, but also what the long-term potential is relative to market opportunity. And so, it's a little bit early for us to speculate on exactly what that -- what we're going to have in the topline disclosure. We do need to spend some time with our partner and align there.So it would be a little bit early for me to start to kind of give you too much detail there. But I think suffice to say we're going to put out enough data that allows investors to understand the profile of the drug and what the long-term potential looks like, at least preliminarily, and it allows us also to follow up with a presentation at a medical meeting that we'll be circling around.Kalpit R. PatelGot it. And do you intend to apply for the Real-Time Oncology Review program, the RTOR program for this drug?Michael A. MetzgerThanks for the follow-up. I think that's an open question and something we'll have to also align with our partner on. As you may know, I believe Kadmon had applied for that. It was granted RTOR with their review of Rezurock. So it's something that we generally don't comment on our regulatory strategy so much as to what we may or may not be able to accomplish. But certainly, it's on the table and we'll have some discussions about it relative to our -- with our partner.Kalpit R. PatelOkay. And then, 1 on the combination trial. Have you, or Incyte, decided if you'll have a control arm with steroids in that trial?Michael A. MetzgerThanks for the question. I think it's still under consideration as to the exact design of the trial and we'll be saying more soon. But a little early. Again, a little early for us to disclose what the exact design of that trial is going to look like.Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Joel Beatty with Baird.Joel Lawrence BeattySo, two, first one is on revumenib. Could you discuss the size of the market opportunity for the 2 separate registrational cohorts? And how they compare with each other for both the initial expected near-term label as well as a longer-term potential?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Joel, thanks for the question. I'm going to turn it over to Anjali. She is going to describe it.Anjali GanguliThinking about the relapsed/refractory setting, I think we feel that the KMT2A population and the NPM1 population maybe closer than expected given that more of the KMT2A population is likely to relapse and need additional therapy to address their disease. So, the current assumption is closer than what you would expect given the initial diagnosis of NPM1 and KMT2A. Moving into frontline, I think we've given the guidance and a lot of publications suggest about 30% of AML is NPM1, while closer to 10% is KMT2A.Joel Lawrence BeattyThen a question on potential in-licensing of new earlier stage agents. We've heard about that for a number of quarters and on the conference call and in fact the 2 agents that you currently have in our great successes that have come out of that. But as those 2 programs move towards late-stage with pivotal data coming in the next few months, does that affect your company's appetite for going back and in-licensing earlier-stage agents at this point?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Joel, thank you for that. Look, I think, business development continues to be a really important component of our strategy long-term. As you pointed out, we were successful in in-licensing the 2 agents that we're working on. We are moving them through registration trials. We do expect to do a fair amount of life cycle. We mentioned earlier line trials for both agents, adjacencies other indications such as IPF for axatilimab and solid tumors for revumenib.I think the idea to bring in additional early-stage targeted oncology assets and we had -- we've been fairly descriptive about what that means, we're talking about sort of preclinical stage, lead stage, preclinical through Phase 1. These are the types of assets that one, we feel it lends to our expertise and we can develop them efficiently to kind of grow them into assets that have meaningful value in a reasonable period of time, and also fit in with the overall kind of dynamic of our company which is growing to accommodate additional works, but certainly don't want to overwhelm the important work that's going on in the late-stage setting.Our priority does remain our two key assets, but bringing on additional 1 or more additional assets of the early-stage variety could add a tremendous amount of value in a reasonably short period of time. And again, it remains the future of Syndax to be able to do that. So, we are keen to evaluate it. Now, I will say that the bar remains extremely high for us to trade off and even spend 1 marginal dollar on additional assets while you have 2 approvable agents in our midst. So we do remain quite interested, but also keep the bar very high to make sure that we bring only the best assets into the pipeline.And lastly, I'll say the team is quite focused on it here. And of course the addition of Neil to our team really will we think add in that variety. So, we're again excited about business development and realize the scope of work is significant for our current pipeline that we look to add over time.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Brad Canino with Stifel.Dara Ahmadi AzarThis is Dara Azar on for Brad Canino. Questions from us. On revumenib, are you collecting samples pre- and post-treatment for analysis of MEN1 resistance mutation? And when should we expect the formula analysis and public data? And on axatilamab, what might be available in the topline that can help us confirm differential activity versus Rezurock?Michael A. MetzgerSo, I think the answer to your first question is, no, we're not tracking that data. And we're not -- yeah, I think the idea is that we publish the data that we had and I think we shouldn't -- you shouldn't expect to see additional data coming out on resistance anytime soon from the current dataset. And then -- I'm sorry, the second question?Dara Ahmadi AzarYes. What might be available in topline for thinking about potential differential activity versus Rezurock, for example, anti-fibrotic benefit, anything like that?Michael A. MetzgerYes, maybe I'll turn it over to Neil to take that.Neil GallagherSo, with all the caveats of the dangers across study comparison, I think your main question is, how much data are we going topline so you guys can actually get an idea about what you're going to see. Our anticipation -- and of course, it's up to be aligned with our partner, our anticipation is to topline as much data as we think we need for to be useful to the investment community and others. But one caveat is that we also want to preserve the ability to present the full dataset at the forthcoming medical meetings. So we don't want to compromise that either. And in fact, we're actively in discussions with Incyte, our counterpart to the Incyte about what that might look like. So, we're not going to be -- it's not going to be minimalist. We will include as much data there as we can, given the caveat that I mentioned presenting at a medical meeting in the future as well.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Justin Zelin with BTIG.Justin Reid ZelinCongrats on the progress here. Just a quick question on revumenib. Is there any demand or any interest in additional investigator-sponsored studies in either AML or other indications or other combinations that we should be expecting in the future?Michael A. MetzgerYes. Justin, first of all, welcome to Syndax. Thanks for covering up and look forward to working with you. Look, I think we actually have a lot of interest in ISPs and there's a whole assortment of work that has either kicked off or will be kicking off related to AML and some of the other disease states that we're looking at. We haven't really disclosed that in any natural form yet. So, I think you'll see some data emerging over the coming months from some of these trials that some of the investigators are doing. But, we haven't been especially prescriptive about how that's going to roll out or what those are yet. So, stay tuned. But I think there is -- suffice to say, a lot of interest in what we're doing and the investigators around the world who are not only involved in our trials, but also some that are not that have asked us to do particular trials of interest.So, maybe Neil has a comment to make as well.Neil GallagherYes. I mean, there's a lot of interest in revumenib in the AML community and acute leukemia community, AML and ALL communities. So, what I would say is that we are developing our lifecycle management plans for revumenib beyond the initial indication, as we've discussed a couple of times earlier on the call in terms of the combinations that we're doing at the moment, what the earlier phase studies look like. We're not ready to discuss the exact design of those studies.So, there will be studies that we will sponsor and then there will be studies that will be conducted through ISS. And our intention is to have an integrated evidence plan, right? So, to be generating data across all relevant patient populations so that we can fully inform the scientific -- provide broad scientific knowledge about the molecule. So as we're ready to reveal not only the details of our own sponsored studies, but also at the broader time, we'd be happy to do that in the future.OperatorAnd it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Michael Metzger for any additional or closing remarks.Michael A. MetzgerThank you, all. We look forward to seeing you at several upcoming medical conferences, including the American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting in May and the European Hematology Association Annual Meeting in June. We'll also be attending the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in June as well as other investor events, which we hope you will join us there. Have a great evening.OperatorThat concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $5.93.Our TakeDaVita ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The uptick in the company’s overall top line and both segments during the period was impressive. The increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments in the quarter was also encouraging. The opening of several dialysis centers within the United States and overseas was promising.However, the dismal overall bottom-line results were disappointing. The contraction of both margins does not bode well for DaVita. The company faced continued labor pressure in the reported quarter, which was further concerning.Zacks Rank and Key PicksDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

The company’s stock price had fallen roughly 17% from its peak in October 2021 on fears about Medicare reimbursement rates, and we used this dislocation to start purchasing shares of what we believe to be the most dominant and complete managed care company in the industry.With several at-scale and interconnected businesses, UNH occupies a unique position within the U.S. healthcare system. UnitedHealth has (a) a dominant managed care organization in commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets, (b) a large and growing presence in local care delivery (OptumHealth’s physicians and ambulatory service centers), (c) one of only three at scale pharmacy benefits managers (OptumRx’s PBM) and (d) a fast-growing healthcare information technology (HCIT), consulting and revenue cycle management (RCM) business (OptumInsight). The combination of the largest MCO (UnitedHealth) with the faster-growing, higher-margin Optum services businesses positions the company to capture a large portion of the future growth opportunities in the U.S. healthcare services industry. We expect balanced growth from both health insurance and health services leading to consistent high-single-digit revenue growth for the company. With margin expansion from scale, share buybacks from its strong cash generating ability (the company currently has $30 billion in net cash), and continued strategic acquisitions, we believe the company can generate mid-teens or better earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UNH shares were down slightly from where we re-initiated a position during the quarter, causing them to be a top detractor (-0.02%) in an overall strong quarter where few positions were down.""Story continuesChristian Delbert/Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is in 16th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Estée Lauder Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$23b - US$7.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 13%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Estée Lauder Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Estée Lauder Companies here  for free.What Can We Tell From Estée Lauder Companies' ROCE Trend?In terms of Estée Lauder Companies' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 13% from 25% five years ago. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. This could mean that the business is losing its competitive advantage or market share, because while more money is being put into ventures, it's actually producing a lower return - ""less bang for their buck"" per se.Story continuesIn Conclusion...From the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for Estée Lauder Companies have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Yet despite these concerning fundamentals, the stock has performed strongly with a 48% return over the last five years, so investors appear very optimistic. Regardless, we don't feel too comfortable with the fundamentals so we'd be steering clear of this stock for now.If you want to continue researching Estée Lauder Companies, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.While Estée Lauder Companies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

TRTN.Top 5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Markets Show ResistanceThe U.S. equity markets showed immense resilience by breaking a four-day losing streak and returning to the growth trajectory last Friday, courtesy of a rebound in the regional banking sector and a strong earnings performance by Apple. The markets have been mostly on tenterhooks as investors remained worried about another financial banking crisis after the collapse of two other mid-sized banks, namely Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank to avert a similar banking catastrophe, the market sentiments largely trended down.However, the shares of regional banks shrugged off the pessimism and witnessed an uptrend to buoy the overall market swing. In addition, strong iPhone sales and key inroads in India and other emerging markets helped Apple to record solid quarterly earnings results. The latest data from Labor Department's job report further revealed that non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 in April compared with broad-based expectations of a rise of 180,000. Wages increased 4.4% year over year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.With improving job market conditions and softening inflationary pressures, investors largely expect the Fed to hold the interest rates in the near term. Moreover, the Fed indicated earlier that there might be just another hike in the current year depending on the macroeconomic factors, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of ""backing and filling"" in the market, they can benefit from ""cash cow"" stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc., DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc., ON Semiconductor Corp. and Triton International Ltd. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

According to our latest Earnings Outlook, 77.6% of the S&amp;P 500 companies have surpassed EPS estimates. This is highly reassuring, especially in the current scenario, which is engulfed by inflationary woes and other headwinds. What is all the more encouraging is that many companies, which have already reported their respective Q1 numbers, have issued better-than-expected guidance.Given this backdrop, investors would like to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns.However, the task is far from easy with a plethora of companies present in the market. Moreover, the complexities related to the stock market and the prevalent turbulence make it even more difficult for individual investors to select outperformers in their portfolios without proper hand-holding. One way to proceed is by paying heed to broker advice. We believe that broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Cleveland-Cliff, Avnet and Commercial Vehicle Group should be on an investors' watchlist.Why Broker Advice Holds ValueBrokers have a better understanding of stocks, deeper knowledge of the industry and a grasp over the broader economy. They scrutinize the company's fundamentals and place them against the prevalent economic scenario to find out how attractive a stock is or otherwise as an investment option.Since brokers arrive at their recommendation (buy, sell or hold) on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is advisable for investors to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock. The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Story continuesOne of the well-accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of market conditions. For instance, in the face of extremely low oil prices, analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates.  Naturally, adding such stocks to one's portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a bullish strategy.Formulating a Winning PortfolioWe have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks. However, considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof as the top line has not been considered.Actually, according to many market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included the price/sales ratio in our screener, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL's 2023 earnings has been revised 17.3% upward. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, is based in Atlanta, GA. DAL is being bolstered by an uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.5% on a year-over-year basis in first-quarter 2023.High fuel costs are, however, a bane. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL's 2023 earnings has been revised 3.1% upward.Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF's 2023 earnings has been revised 21.9% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Avnet is benefiting from robust demand for its products across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions. Improvement in the Americas also served as a tailwind. Its continued focus on boosting IoT capabilities is helping it expand in the newer markets and win customers. Moreover, cost-saving efforts are aiding profitability.Avnet, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, has an impressive surprise history, with its earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 12.9%.Commercial Vehicle Group supplies interior systems, vision safety solutions and other cab-related products for the global commercial vehicle market, including the heavy-duty (Class 8) truck market, the construction market and other specialized transportation markets.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL's 2023 earnings has been revised 3.1% upward.

392,2a35072b-c527-318b-8ca2-3d41eff5f28c,FCX,2023-05-10,Investors Heavily Search Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-freeport-mcmoran-130001016.html,1683637201,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -8.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -15.6%. This estimate has changed +2.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.30 indicates a change of +11.8% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $23.91 billion and $24.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks. John?Story continuesJohn FieldlyThank you, Cameron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We achieved record sales for the first quarter of approximately $260 million, an increase of 95% from last year's first quarter of $133 million, exceeding the $200 million revenue threshold for the first time in company history. And we saw sequential increase from the fourth quarter of sales of $178 million, exceeded it by $82 million or 46% growth sequentially. Our North America revenue increased 101% for the quarter to $249 million, up from $124 million in the year ago quarter. Celsius continues to be the top driver of growth within the energy category and was the number one dollar growth brand in total U.S. MULOC Energy for the last 52 weeks ending as of March 26, 2023, growing approximately $552 million in increased retail sales and contributed to 23% of category growth on an overall increase of 139.6% versus the year ago period. Per IRI in the last 4 weeks ending as of March 26, 2023, in total MULOC Energy, Celsius is the number three energy drink brand in the United States, reaching a new market share record totaling 7.5%, doubling its 3.7% share a year ago. As Celsius and Pepsi continue to synchronize our organizations, we continue to see opportunities for future efficiencies. In the first quarter, we experienced an inventory build quarter-over-quarter from December 31, 2022. We expect this increase was due to anticipated retailer resets and to build inventory levels. We will continue to work with Pepsi to make sure there is adequate inventory and update shareholders quarterly if there is any significant deltas that impact the warehouse center inventory levels. Jarrod will provide additional details shortly. We continue to see growth across all channels, including those non-tracked, with the Club channel sales totaling over $47 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, up 77% compared to $26 million in the first quarter of 2022. We also just hit a new record on Amazon. Celsius is now the second largest energy drink brand with a 19.1% share of the energy category as of the last 4-week period ending April 22, 2023 per stack line energy drink category total U.S. data. In addition, we continue to expand growth opportunities and non-tracked food service channels and are gaining more distribution in colleges, universities, hospitals, hotels, eateries and casinos and more. Overall, food service represented approximately about 10% of our PepsiCo revenues, and we see significant opportunities to scale and grow over time. We have been extremely happy with our PepsiCo partnership and see a long runway of growth ahead of us across a variety of channels, including expanding in retail, convenience, and foodservice. As highlighted in our earnings supplement for the 4-week period, per IRI spends, total energy data ending March 26, 2023 as stated, in MULOC, Celsius as the number three energy drink brand in the United States now has a 7.5% market share, doubling from its 3.7% share a year ago, reaching an all-time new high. In addition, in MULOC, Celsius grew its ACV to a record 95.4% versus 69.5% in the year ago period, which is a tremendous achievement by both our teams and our partner, Pepsi. And in convenience, Celsius has gained an additional 37.7 points of ACV growth versus the prior year to end the period at a 93.4% compared to 55.7% of ACV in the prior year. This provides a tremendous opportunity as we have gained greater availability across the country in the convenience channel and are now gaining more awareness with consumers. Internationally, sales grew 15% growth rate for the quarter, totaling $11.4 million compared to $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. We believe there is significant opportunity for international growth going forward with PepsiCo. While we just began our distribution partnership with Pepsi and our initial focus has been on the U.S. distribution transition to their network, we have begun initial discussions, and we see significant opportunities to capitalize on global scale in the future, reflecting the changes in consumer preferences for better-for-you offerings. While the U.S. transition has taken a majority of our focus to date, we do expect to announce additional international expansion details in the future. With that said, we look forward, probably likely to early 2024, for opportunities to roll out internationally with 2023 being a year of planning around logistics, production, distribution and marketing. The company achieved a record non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $48.7 million for the first quarter, representing over 18% of sales for the period. This was driven by not only record sales, but we also saw benefits across the timing of marketing and sales programs as well as the results of gaining operational leverage across G&amp;A. Although we saw some very good leverage across our SG&amp;A, we would expect our investments to increase during the summer season of Q2 and Q3 of this year as we continue to drive growth awareness profitably and are entering into a number of campaigns designed to grow brand awareness. The company sees opportunities to drive incremental efficiencies to the back half of 2023 from expected improvements in gross profit margins as we optimize and synergize our supply chain and gain more efficiencies. In addition, we see additional leverage opportunities as we scale to drive further efficiencies in our SG&amp;A. To close my prepared remarks, we achieved the highest quarterly dollar sales growth in company history in the first quarter. And as previously -- our previous recorded highest quarterly record revenue was in Q3 of 2022. We exceeded by over $70 million. We are gaining market share at the fastest pace in company history, while at the same time drove the highest quarterly EBITDA margin of over 18%, demonstrating the leverage in our operating model. We believe we have significant runway ahead of us and are excited about the spring resets, driving additional shelf space in both new and existing customers while optimizing our placements. Celsius is now an established leader in the energy category, driving growth in the entire category with incremental opportunities for further growth as we continue to scale and leverage our partnership. I will now turn the call over to Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, for his prepared remarks. Jarrod?Jarrod LanghansThank you, John. Turning to our first quarter financial results, revenue was approximately $260 million, an increase of 95% from $133 million, driven by our North American business. Our first quarter revenues were $249 million, an increase of 101% from the same period in 2022. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to our integration into the Pepsi distribution system, where we saw increases across the board, including continued strong growth in traditional distribution channels including SKU increases, as well as distribution across a number of new channels within CNG and foodservice. We've also seen our velocity increase post our significant ACV growth. During the quarter, we saw an increase in the days inventory outstanding within the mixing centers relative to the end of 2022, which equated to roughly $20 million to $25 million in incremental sales. We would anticipate that this build would be sustained through the summer selling season as we continue to see steady growth across our footprint. Gross profit for the quarter increased 111% to $114 million, up from $54 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margins in the first quarter were approximately 44% of revenues compared to approximately 40% for the prior year first quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins was due to lower average can prices and leverage of our Orbit model, offset in part by increased freight and a few million dollars of inventory write-offs. Q1 was the second quarter that we were operating within our new distribution system, and we continue to drive efficiencies and optimization within the system while maintaining our number one goal of keeping the shelf stocked in order to meet the consumer demand. And looking out across the year, we continue to believe that we will operate with gross margins in the mid-40s with some pressure during the first half of the year while we fully integrate into our new distribution system and begin to better optimize our supply chain with upside in the back half of the year. Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023 were approximately $48 million, an increase of approximately 51%. Although we saw increased marketing investment during the quarter in line with historical spend, this was offset by less expense within sales due to timing of our activation. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 18.3% compared to 23.7% in the prior year. On a full year basis, we continue to expect our sales and marketing expenditures to remain consistent with historical run rates. As noted, this quarter benefited by timing as well as some inventory builds within our mixing centers. General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023 were approximately $21 million, an increase of 75% relative to Q1 2022. This increase was due to increased employee costs associated with building a back shop that can scale as we grow, including stock-based compensation as well as administrative fees such as legal, audit and other consulting fees. G&amp;A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% for the first quarter of 2023 versus 9% in the prior year, which is in line with expectations. We would expect to see this area begin to leverage against our growth during 2023. Moving to our back-office build-out, we have significantly expanded our back-office team over the last year, adding a number of team members across IT, FP&amp;A, controlling, legal and HR, driving great improvements, consistency in processes, and transparency across the business. We look forward to the many successes that these team members will assist us with as we look to deliver an effective control environment for 2023 and drive further value with our operations, sales, and marketing teams. From a legal perspective, we have closed on the settlement proceedings with our can label and are pleased to have that behind us. In regard to the SEC review, we continue to cooperate with any inquiries or requests that are received. With that said, we do not have any further updates at this point in time. Focusing now on liquidity and capital resources, as of March 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $634 million and net working capital of approximately $801 million. Included within the first quarter cash balance was approximately $38 million, which is primarily balances due to Pepsi representing excess funds provided by Pepsi for our distributor transition. Cash flows used by operating activities totaled $14 million for the first quarter, which compares to $9 million in net cash provided by operating activities in Q1 last year. Overall, we saw some cash usage associated with our growth as well as the timing of working capital. As we look to Q2, we would expect to return the excess funds to Pepsi while also improving on our DSO. Overall, we would expect that excluding timing impacts of cash transactions associated with the Pepsi transaction, we will continue to generate cash year-over-year. Looking at inventory, total inventory ended at roughly $150 million, down versus the prior quarter. This was driven in large part by the significant increases that we saw in our sales volume. As we look to the busy summer months, we will see production increase significantly to accommodate the demand of the market. Going forward, we would look to carry additional inventory in order to make sure that we are able to keep up with the significant growth we are experiencing. At the same time, we do see opportunities to drive efficiencies in our DIO as we move through 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.Mark Stiefel AstrachanI'm still writing down some of that stuff that you just breezed through. Whew, that is a fast transcript. Anyway, I guess to start, maybe give us a bit of an update on how the spring resets look from a shelf space standpoint and how much is in existing energy doors, how much is coming in or going into new doors and kind of overall expectations for incremental space for the year?John FieldlyYes, Mark, great question. I think we had a -- we're really excited about the resets that started off this year, especially started in January. We saw a good increase in the quarter. What we're looking at is we saw a lot of great expansion, as I kind of mentioned on the call, in the convenience channel, where we saw the biggest really ACV gains when you go from over a 37.7% really increasing points of distribution in convenience. That's a really big win for the company. It's really the last channel of expansion for us into tracked channels. We're really excited about that. I think we're seeing good velocities in the convenience channel as well. We're seeing them grow. That's a big win. Also, in overall MULOC, getting to that 95.4% of ACV, most recently as of the March 26 data coming out of the IRI SPINS data. I think we have some more expansion there, but we really grew significantly on the resets. Also, the number of items carried on average per store increased as well. Right now, we're looking at about an average, at the last 4 weeks as of March 26, really at the end of the quarter, we went from an average of about 13.6 items per location in the recorded channel versus the prior year was at 8.6%. We saw a really good growth in a number of units. We've got some more resets ahead of us. I think the biggest opportunity we have as well as in tracked channels is really gaining better placements in locations, more cold availability, more cooler placements and those type of execution. Maybe not a large increase in number of doors being at the 95% at the end of the quarter, but really the breadth in each retailer, there's massive opportunity for us.Mark Stiefel AstrachanGot it. That's helpful. And maybe just on the doors, so existing doors versus new doors, do you still want to be in the legacy energy door? And then somewhat related to that, I think many folks have been surprised that the velocity is being not only as strong as they've been, but actually accelerating with all the incremental points of distribution. How much of that is just higher velocity C-stores versus just overall brand awareness? And kind of how do you think about that number through the summer?John FieldlyYes. I think when you look at our, I guess as you called them, legacy doors, that's mainly in the food, when you look at the food channel. We still maintain in the HCC section in a variety of stores, including Publix and Kroger and those. But a majority of the stores outside of those are in energy. We do great business in the food channel. We do extremely well at Publix, doing extremely well at Kroger. It's really about gaining those additional off-shelf placements, those additional cold placements, cooler placements. We're not going to change that strategy within the food in our existing business at this time. But when we look at the distribution ahead, there is opportunities for additional SKUs. We see that. We've got some great innovation planned for this summer. I think you saw some great innovation come out in the first quarter with new flavor innovation, our lemon-lime, our green apple cherry flavor at 7-Eleven was a great win for us. There's a lot of great innovation coming this summer that we'll be able to add some additional breadth within the retailers.Mark Stiefel AstrachanThat's great. And just on the velocity? Thank you.John FieldlyYes. I think we're seeing velocity increase, Mark. I think there's opportunities for sure to go further north on that. We've got some great marketing programs ahead of us, and we think summer is going to be a great summer for us. We're watching it closely. I think we don't provide any forward guidance, but something to look at, and we're monitoring it closely all around, especially as we increased such an exponential increase in ACV.OperatorYour next question is coming from Jeff Van Sinderen from B. Riley.Jeffrey Wallin Van SinderenLet me add my congratulations on the strong quarterly metrics. I wonder if we can kind of circle back to and delve a little bit more into how much of the Q1 reacceleration of growth was initial channel fill for new stores, new doors call it, added SKUs, etc., versus reorders derived from sell-through at retail. Just trying to get a better sense I guess of how much the initial channel fill impacted new doors, new SKUs in the quarter? And then maybe what impact that phenomenon might have in Q2? I think you alluded to a little bit of that or Jarrod did in his prepared comments, maybe just how we should think about growth acceleration from here.John FieldlyYes. No, thanks, Jeff. We did gain some distribution with the resets that've taken place. And I think as we're starting to see velocity increase, that is a really good sign that we're cycling through whatever pipe sales we had for the quarter. The increase in distribution didn't slow the overall velocity. The sales are moving quicker out of the register. I think that puts us in a good position. We feel really confident. It's hard to say exactly what the pipe fill was. We did talk about in the quarter how we saw Pepsi increase inventory levels, which Jarrod talked about earlier in regards to approximately $20 million to $25 million infill as the average impact for the quarter with the increase in inventory levels. But I think seeing the velocities increase, I think we're get a really strong feeling that we're seeing repeat purchases out there.Jeffrey Wallin Van SinderenOkay. That's helpful in quantifying the inventory with Pepsi. And let me ask you this, as you're going into some of the -- I mean you've got a great ACV now, so you're going into some I guess some C-stores, for example, that might be lower volumes. Some other doors within various retailers that might be perhaps a little bit lower volume. Just wondering what you're experiencing there as far as sell-throughs? And then overall, what's your outlook for your business in the C-channel?John FieldlyYes, that's a great question. I mean we did gain a lot of Tier 3 and Tier 4 convenience distribution, especially with the expansion since October with the Pepsi system. We had a lot of Tier 1 and Tier 2. It's really building out a further breadth within those, within our convenience where we're seeing, starting to see velocities increase. I think when you look at the smaller Tier 3, Tier 4, the lower velocity, it's difficult to get the true reporting on that, on the velocity. I think we're looking at the overall velocity as a good number, an indication on how the overall health of the portfolio is performing. And I think we're really confident in convenience. We know this brand performs well. We're seeing usage occasions expand outside of energy. And we're just really excited on where the brand is and where the portfolio and where we're headed. It's something we're monitoring closely, but foodservice now, when you look at foodservice opportunity, which is 10% of Celsius' business, it just shows you the broad brush of the portfolio and how it's resonating with a broad brush of consumers today.Jeffrey Wallin Van SinderenIt sounds like you're gaining more -- you feel like you're gaining more traction in foodservice and some of the other channels as well that are not reported or not tracked.John FieldlyThat's correct. We see great opportunity in non-tracked channels as well.OperatorYour next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.Kevin Michael GrundyQuestion, John, for you. Just in terms of the ambition now with items per store, so the ACV progress has been fantastic. I remember a conversation you and I had in the fall, and it was a 10% market share was kind of an ambition at that point. If we can get 92% ACV, if we can get 15 items per store, if we can maintain current velocity. You're kind of checking all the boxes at this point, around 7.5% share. This path to 10% is very, very near and present now. As you kind of take a step back, what do you think is possible now in the Pepsi system? The 10%, again, seems like it's very attainable and near term. What do you think is possible now for this brand as you look at the strength and the reach of the Pepsi system as well as what you guys have done with the brand?John FieldlyYes. I think, Kevin, I mean, it's a great question. I think we've just seen this ACV, we're quite amazed with how quickly the ACV has come together at a 95%. Internally, we thought we were going to at least take potentially another 12 months, 18 months to get to that 95% ACV. Totally really give hats off to our sales team, our key accounts team, and also all our partners at Pepsi has done just an amazing job. I think they see the opportunity we have here with Celsius that is bringing in new consumers to the category. And I think when you look at it, we have a lot to learn over the next probably a quarter or 2 to see how this product, this portfolio performs in the channels that it's expanded in, especially in the convenience channel so quickly. I think we'll have a better view of that probably the end of next quarter and especially at the end of Q3. But when you look at the number of items per store, we're at 13.6%. When you look at some of the current velocity numbers we had on a per SKU item and you look at gaining 15 to 17 items per store by the end of the year, that's potential, that gets you close to that 10% opportunity, 10% share in the category. We're really excited to hit the 7.5% share most recently at the end of the first quarter, and there's lots of opportunities ahead.Kevin Michael GrundyAnd then just a follow-up. I feel like I'd probably be remiss if we did not touch on some of the competitive launches in the space, including Monster Zero Sugar, Reign Storm, which it's not lost on me for a moment, kind of looks remarkably from a packaging perspective like your product, Prime in sports and energy. There's been a lot in a fairly short period of time. And I know it's still very early days with Zero Sugar and Reign Storm which are kind of just hitting. Thoughts there in terms of how worrisome those competitive launches are? Anything you're seeing very early days where there's some overlap with Celsius? Anything you can give there in terms of market share, velocity, etc., I think would be helpful to folks. I can pass it on. Thank you.John FieldlyYes. Kevin, great question. I mean there's competition every day. And energy category is about as fierce as they come. Tons of new competition every day. And I think where the opportunity lies, what we're looking at, you talk about where Celsius can go, it's like in Miami, when you look at the Miami Fort Lauderdale market in MULOC the last 4 weeks ending as of April 23, 2023, we have about a 21.7% share in the market. There's a lot of opportunities. We're number two brand now on Amazon. We compete with a lot of different brands in the category. I'm not going to comment on any other brand out there. It's a big category and we wish every brand luck on operating their business. We're really excited where our portfolio is, where it's resonating with consumers, excited about our partner Pepsi, and just see a lot of opportunities at this time. We're really excited about moving forward.OperatorYour next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS.Peter K. GromThanks, Operator, and good evening, everyone. Jarrod, I just had a few questions on gross margin. Maybe just first, can you just help us understand how much the inventory write-off impacted GM this quarter? And then second, I recognize you still expect gross margin for the year in this mid-40% range, and I may have misheard you, but I thought you mentioned that it's like 1/2 gross margins to be under pressure. Is that just relative to the mid-40% range? Is that year-over-year? Just any color on that comment would be helpful.Jarrod LanghansYes. No, we were -- we've been consistent with saying we're going to be in the mid-40s. If you looked at the run rate we left Q4 on, we did see some additional write-offs on inventory as we are building out the supply chain and driving some efficiencies within that channel. As I mentioned on the call, it's a couple of million dollars, so not a huge amount, but enough to impact the margin a little bit. We also had a little bit higher freight costs within the quarter. As we get to the back half of the year, we'll be looking to clean up the freight lanes and make sure we got the supply chain operating as efficiently as possible and making sure we're fully optimized. It was really just around the inventory and the create in terms of what would have driven margins really from a Q4 to a Q1 perspective. But we're still confident in the mid-40s and we see the opportunity for upside in the back half of the year as we get fully integrated into our new distributor.Peter K. GromOkay. Super helpful. And I guess just -- I would love to get some more details on kind of this international discussion. And I recognize that it's likely to prove to be a '24 narrative, but can you maybe just help us understand the work you've done that informs the decision that the brand can resonate and do well in these markets? What markets are you targeting initially? Is this going to be some broad-based multimarket rollout? Is it going to be more gradual? Just any initial color you can provide would be super helpful.Jarrod LanghansYes. I think we've talked about this on some of the conferences we've been in back in March. But from our perspective, we look to hit markets that are obviously already well-defined energy markets so we're not going into a new market that we have to train the customer on what is energy. If you look around, kind of think of APAC in Europe, the different markets that are popular energy drink markets, we'd look to roll into those first. We're not going to do a shotgun approach. We'll look to go into a handful of markets first and learn and partner in most instances with Pepsi or Pepsi partners and really use that as a tool to learn to build the model. And then from there, we would look to roll into more markets over the coming years. But I would say for kind of a 2024 launch, we're looking at a handful of markets to really get into, understand them, learn them, but they're going to be the bigger energy markets across Europe and APAC. We do see some opportunities in some smaller markets where we can kind of roll in because they're close to co-packers and they're ready. But those wouldn't really move the needle. There's some core markets we'll learn at and most people know what those markets would be if you look in Europe and in APAC in terms of what are the big energy drink markets. That's really -- this year, it's all about planning. It's about getting aligned with the partners. It's about creating market launch plans and then looking to roll out in 2024.OperatorYour next question is coming from Jon Keypour from Bank of America.Jonathan Daniel KeypourI just wanted to drill into the foodservice commentary you guys had. If I heard correctly, that was 10% of sales in the quarter. And I'm just wondering maybe what the impact as Pepsi kind of brought in that inventory to sell, what that -- what the pipe fills for foodservice might have been in 1Q?John FieldlyYes, Jon, great question. And just to correct myself there, that is 10% of our Pepsi sales approximately is coming from the foodservice business. We've been working on that since October when we first launched, initially partnered with Pepsi. We've been expanding distribution in a variety of outlets and college universities, hospitals, just expanded into a variety of hotels. It is not really a pipe fill in the quarter I would say, we just to continue to build upon the momentum. We are gaining more distribution, but we're seeing good reorders, strong reorders within the channel, and we think that can be a really meaningful growth opportunity for us as we go forward and gain more distribution. We just really -- as we look ahead, the distribution opportunities is at eateries and within fast casual restaurants. We feel there's a great opportunity there, and that really has been untapped. It definitely tells you the brand resonates with an extremely broad consumer just to see the sales mix at the Pepsi system of approximately 10% of sales today. It gets us really excited.Jonathan Daniel KeypourJust one follow-up. I guess looking at the Nielsen data, this is a boring question that I got asked a lot last quarter, but I have 1Q growth in scanned channels about 138%. If we use that and sort of apply to what 1Q was in '22, it implies something like $290 million. It's about a $45 million difference. Whereas if you do the same math in 4Q, it was about a $50 million difference. Is that the same kind of like the lag between scanned and reported that we should kind of expect? Or is it going to be -- is there any line-of-sight you guys have to some lumpiness or more or less any kind of swings in that regard?John FieldlyYes. I mean, what you're getting at is scans coming out of the registers, so when you look at it, I think there's probably some lumpiness in regards to the kind of the value chain as it's going through the Pepsi mixing centers and then into their sales farms and then into the customers and then cycling through. But it's something we watch. You also have the mix of our Amazon business as well as our Club business that's in there. It didn't grow at those faster rates. I think it's a mix of all those items and probably a little bit of timing.OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Your next question is coming from Gerald Prescarelli from Wedbush Securities.Gerald John PascarelliThanks very much for the question. Obviously, very strong revenue growth here. It sounds like distributor inventory levels are going to remain elevated at least over the next few months. Just on your supply chain, can you speak to your ability to continue to service this type of demand maybe over the longer term in particular as it relates to your aluminum can supply? Which is now back to being sourced domestically, which has obviously had a big benefit to your margins. Just I guess any kind of high-level color you could provide on your thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.Jarrod LanghansYes. From a raw material perspective, we're in great shape. We've got multiple partners in the U.S., like you mentioned, from a can perspective. No issues there. From a capacity perspective, we've got the ability to quickly double in terms of capacity and in terms of production. We've got our Orbit model built, but we've got a number of co-packers that we inflect to, and we have capacity at our current co-packers that we can utilize as well. We're in great shape in order to meet the demand we're seeing or even demand outsized relative to what we're seeing. From a supply chain and production perspective, we're in good shape.Gerald John PascarelliThanks, Jarrod, appreciate it. Next one for me is just on the Club channel. If you could just provide maybe a refresher of where we are kind of on the 18-pack transition? I know you were in the midst of rolling out a second variety pack to your legacy stores. And then finally, on the BJ's rollout, just where we are with that. I know that was taking place over the course of this quarter. Thanks.John FieldlyGerald, it's John. We pretty much have moved into the 18-back within all of the Club channels. And we started to expand from our core variety pack. In addition, you'll see incremental placements at a variety of Club channels with our bi-pack that went in. And it's been doing -- both packs have been doing extremely well. And I think there's opportunities to get further flavor combinations and/or single flavors in that channel since we're seeing great success there.OperatorYour next question is coming from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.Michael LaveryJust wanted to come back to the $20 million to $25 million inventory you mentioned for the Pepsi system, the inventory build. With the ACV running ahead of your expectations and velocities as well, is there a good portion of that that's really just an adjustment to faster sell-through and kind of a reset to normalized levels that are above what they would have initially expected? Or is that really some cushion volume that's pulled forward? Can you kind of dissect out of that amount if there's a bit of both?Jarrod LanghansYes. There's a bit of a build for the summer selling season, so to get ready for it and to meet the expected volumes. To your point, a bit of that is in anticipation of Q2 and Q3. We've also got a number of activations and a number of sales and marketing programs that we've got ahead of us over summer. I would say it's partially -- well, in large part, it's preparation of what's to come.Michael LaveryOkay. That's helpful. And just on the SG&amp;A run rate, it's been in roughly the same neighborhood the last 3 or so quarters. Looking ahead, I know you've talked about stepping up the marketing a little bit, but you also get some operating leverage benefits from the revenue growth. How do we think about just how that might look over the rest of the year?Jarrod LanghansYes. Our plan is -- or at least our expectation is, if we have the opportunity to continue to drive velocity, we want to maintain our kind of historical run rate. I think on our last call, we talked about kind of 22% to 24%. I think historically, we've been more in that 23%, 24% range, so we were talking about maybe shave off a couple of percent this year. We did just over 18% in the quarter. We did benefit with some of that inventory build, but also with the speed at which our revenues are growing and the ability that our marketing team has been able to really drive that velocity and our sales team has been able to drive the ACV with Pepsi. We have been benefiting and seeing leverage there. We are going to -- we've got 100 days of summer program. We've got activation in a number of things we'll be doing over the summer, so we do look to increase our marketing and sales spend. And so at least for the summer period, we're -- the goal is to stay consistent with history. But there is opportunities with the rate we're seeing the revenues grow to continue to leverage. And I think the goal for the year was to end the year up with kind of 22% marker. Can we do better? If we have the opportunity, we will. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we're putting the right money into the right investment and to making sure those velocities continue to grow.OperatorYour next question is coming from Thomas McGovern from Maxim Group.Thomas McGovernJust to start, I just have a question on the back-office build-out. Given your summer launches, which you guys have mentioned quite a few times, and then this presumed transition into the international markets, just want to get an idea of how you guys are looking at it? Do you think it's sufficient build-out for the near term? Or do you expect to continue to build on your back office throughout 2023?John FieldlyWell, I think -- thanks, Thomas, for the question. I think when you look at the back office, as Jarrod was talking about, we've been building it out really on our finance, IT that he's referencing as well as our GL teams as well as our legal teams. When you look at back shop office there, we've built out a great team. We probably have a few more hires here that we're working on. But we've been really investing as well, in addition to Jarrod's departments that he was referencing on specific finance, HR, legal areas, we also are investing in operations department as well. We'll have some additional hires there as we scale and gain more really and open up additional co-packers or/and have greater runs taking place to drive more efficiencies with logistics and so on. But we have also been investing and continue to plan to invest and grow our sales teams and marketing teams as we build out. I think you're going to start -- you're going to see leverage opportunities, especially when you look at building out the human resources, and I think we're going to get better leverage on our marketing investments, especially now that we have much broader distribution coming in and have reached that 95% ACV in the U.S. Now when we build out internationally and the plans we're working on, we will be investing in these new markets. We'll have more details on that as we continue to get further and in back half of '23 and '24. But there will be initial investments that will be required to enter new markets on a go-forward basis.Thomas McGovernAnd then just my last question real quick is, if you guys are still providing these metrics, I was curious to know how many branded coolers there are at the end of the quarter? How many coolers you're in total? And then just kind of where you guys are at in terms of penetrating Pepsi's I believe it was 50,000 Pepsi and energy coolers that you guys mentioned on one of the last calls. Kind of want an update on there if you can provide it.John FieldlyYes. We've eliminated some of those specific details that we were -- due to competitive competition coming on in the category vigorously. We still have a big presence and a big push for coolers. And that's a big opportunity for us, gaining more cold placements. We see that opportunity. Now the number of coolers we're investing, we made a decision not to disclose that specific number on a go-forward basis. But we are investing in coolers. We're investing in additional placements, off-shelf racks and those types. And you think there's a lot of opportunities in the past, on the last call we said we were working towards and planning to have placed by the end of the year of approximately 20,000 Celsius branded coolers. But that's -- we're not going to provide any additional color on that.OperatorYour next question is coming from Sean McGowan from ROTH.Sean Patrick McGowanI had a couple of questions. One on freight. Are you -- have you seen --John FieldlySean, are you there? We seem to have lost the signal.Sean Patrick McGowanI must be having a problem with the signal. I'll just talk to you guys later.OperatorThank you. That concludes today's conference. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.John FieldlyThank you, Matt. And thank you, everyone, on behalf of the company.

You can take a breath. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I highlight our achievements for the first quarter, I think it's important that I reiterate what we're trying to build at Xeris. Every day, everyone at Xeris is intensely focused on building a substantial patient-centric, commercially focused, self-sustaining biopharma enterprise with multiple products -- commercial products in multiple therapeutic areas, a highly targeted development pipeline that has significant long-term promise and increasingly, a significant value-added technology partnership business, literally a three dimensional enterprise.What you will hear today, is that we are continuing to progress very successfully on that journey. We are executing on our vision. As I said just a few short weeks ago, when we reported outstanding 2022 results, our momentum from 2022 has set us up for a great 2023. First quarter 2023 delivered another record of quarterly revenue, strong underlying demand for Gvoke, Keveyis and Recorlev, and other potentially very valuable XeriJect partnership and a continued healthy cash position.Here are the headlines. We have achieved first quarter total revenue of $33.2 million, representing 50% growth compared to first quarter of '22. We ended first quarter 2023 with $95.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We announced a research collaboration and option agreement with Regeneron for XeriJect formulations. And we are [affirming] our 2023 guidance of total revenues of $135 million to $165 million, cash utilization from operating activities of between 57 and $77 million, and year end cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of between 45 and $65 million. Steve will go into those in greater detail as we progress.Let's start with the commercial portion of our business, which generated $32 million in the quarter, representing a 47% increase over last year in the first quarter. First, Gvoke. Gvoke had another record quarter of net revenue in prescriptions, just over $15 million in net revenue, a 21% increase compared to first quarter of '22. Total prescriptions for the first quarter were just shy of 46,000, growing 50% compared to the same period last year, and a 10% increase from fourth quarter of '22, which is a very good sign since the first quarter market growth is historically flat to the fourth quarter of the prior year.Since the beginning of the year, market growth is back to double-digits, with Gvoke continuing to outpace all other products and driving that market growth. At the end of April, Gvoke market share of new and total prescriptions in the glucagon market grew to approximately 30% and 29%, respectively. Ready-to-use glucagon products now represent over 75% of the total new prescription market for glucagon. Gvoke is also off to a good start in the second quarter, having recently topped 4,000 prescriptions per week for the first time and for two consecutive weeks.I mentioned this on our fourth quarter call in a few weeks ago, but due to the significance, I believe it bears repeating, especially since we're entering an important conference period. While more and more patients on insulin are getting ready-to-use glucagon such as Gvoke, there are still over 7 million people on insulin who remain at high risk and don't have a ready-to-use Gvoke available just in case. To address this critical situation and motivate health care professionals to do more, the American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and others have recently updated their guidelines and algorithms to include an important focus on the incorporation of ready-to-use glucagon into clinical practice.For example, the Endo Society expanded the definition of those at high risk for severe low blood sugar and strongly recommends that ready-to-use glucagon should be prescribed for all patients with diabetes who are on daily insulin or Sulfonylureas, confirming what we've been saying all along. On to Recorlev. Recorlev generated $4.5 million in net revenue for the first quarter, an increase of approximately 18% from the fourth quarter of '22. We continue to see a steady increase in referrals, new patients on drug and unique prescribers of Recorlev in the first quarter. For example, we saw an increase in the number of referrals to Recorlev in the first quarter of nearly 30% from the prior quarter. Interestingly, in the first quarter, more than 30% of patients were prescribed Recorlev as their first drug therapy. This means that health care professionals are valuing Recorlev as a first-line treatment for Cushing's syndrome post surgery. Overall, Recorlev is developing exactly as expected.Moving to Keveyis. First quarter revenue for Keveyis was approximately $13 million, which represents an increase of 37% compared to the first quarter of '22. Since the first generic was approved in late December, it has not had a material impact on Keveyis to-date in 2023. In fact, our referral rates and patients on drug remain very steady. That isn't to say there won't be an impact. However, this is a challenging marketplace that requires significant work to identify, initiate and maintain patients on therapy. We have so far only seen glimpses of how generics may impact that process and the market as a whole. We'll see how it plays out over the course of the year. That said, given the market dynamics historically, we are continuing to invest in Keveyis despite the entrance of a generic and believe we can maintain a considerable portion of the business we've worked so hard to build on behalf of the PPP patient community, and we continue to monitor the landscape.Xeris is committed to ensuring everyone who needs access to Recorlev and Keveyis will receive it, our dedicated Xeris CareConnection's team, patient advocates and mentors support patients and health care providers through the product initiation, reimbursement and titration process, and we will continue that effort.Let's turn to our pipeline and partnered programs. As you know, we are focused on advancing our XeriSol levothyroxine development program to eventual commercialization. We recently began recruiting patients in the Phase II study and hope to dose the first patient before the end of the second quarter. The primary objectives of this Phase II study are to determine a target dose conversion factor for oral -- from oral levothyroxine to our liquid ready-to-use subcutaneous levothyroxine, one week injection and to assess the safety and tolerability of our XeriSol levothyroxine after once weekly subcutaneous injections in subjects with hypothyroidism.The study will also gather insight on each subject's thyroxine, or T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH levels over the course of the study. Data from this Phase II study will help inform our proposal to the FDA for a pivotal Phase III program. Oral levothyroxine has been the standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism for many years, and it is one of the most prescribed medicines in the United States, generating more than 100 million prescriptions per year. However, 47% of patients have some GI issue or combined GI condition with impacting oral absorption, 21% report taking concomitant medications that interfere with absorption, and 17% of patients admit to compliance issues with the daily oral regimen, many of whom may be the same patient. As a result, we believe that our once weekly subcutaneous levothyroxine, if approved, will compete in a potential $2 billion to $3 billion market segment.Now on to our growing Xeris partnership business. In March, we announced the XeriJect platform partnership, this one with Regeneron to enable subcutaneous delivery of potentially several monoclonal antibodies. Under the terms of this collaboration and option agreement, Xeris will use our XeriJect formulation to develop ultra highly concentrated, ready-to-use, small volume, subcutaneous injections of two undisclosed monoclonal antibodies developed by Regeneron.Regeneron has an option to license clinical development and commercial rights to XeriJect for these molecules and to nominate additional molecules for formulation and potential development and commercialization. This is our third recently disclosed Xeris technology partnership, following collaborations with Merck and Horizon, which highlights the unique value proposition of XeriJect as well as the investment and progress Xeris has been making in advancing XeriJect into clinical GMP readiness.So where are we with Merck and Horizon programs? For Merck, we have completed the XeriJect formulation stability assessment of the molecule. And at this point, Merck is evaluating the product for further clinical development and commercialization. With Horizon partnership, we're currently in the initial stages of formulation of TEPEZZA in our XeriJect delivery system. Once we meet the agreed-upon product profile, we will receive the previously disclosed $6 million from Horizon. If they sign the licensing agreement, giving them exclusive rights in the category, Xeris would be entitled to future development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on future sales.With a great first quarter behind us and from where we stand today, I want to reiterate that we are affirming our total revenue guidance of $135 million to $165 million, cash utilization of $57 million to $75 million, a year end cash position in the range of $45 million to $65 million and achieving cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter, without the need for additional capital to fund our operations.I will now turn the call over to Steve for additional details on our first quarter performance.Steven M. PieperThanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I will focus my remarks on key financial results for the first quarter 2023. The details of which are in the press release issued this morning. Total revenue was a record $33.2 million, representing a 50% increase over the same quarter last year. Strong underlying patient demand across all three products, coupled with revenue from our collaboration partnerships drove this growth in total revenue. Gvoke net revenue for the quarter was a record $15 million, representing a 21% increase compared to the same period last year. Continued growth in Gvoke prescriptions and market share drove this increase.Gvoke prescriptions topped 45,000 for the first time, a 50% increase compared to the same period in 2022. Gvoke ended the quarter with total retail market share of approximately 28% compared to approximately 21% in March of 2022. The total glucagon prescription market grew 3% compared to the fourth quarter of '22. Notably, Gvoke total prescriptions grew 10% in the same period, once again significantly outpacing the market. More promising, we are seeing this momentum continue into the second quarter, as Paul mentioned, with Gvoke weekly prescriptions exceeding 4,000 prescriptions in consecutive weeks.Moving to Keveyis. Keveyis net revenue for the quarter was $12.8 million, representing a 37% increase compared to the same period last year. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in the number of patients on Keveyis. To date, we have not experienced any material negative impact to Keveyis from the launch of a generic. We continue to proactively monitor and defend Keveyis against generic competition, while seeking patents to restore our exclusive rights.Moving to Recorlev. Recorlev net revenue for the quarter was $4.5 million, which represents an 18% increase over the fourth quarter. This growth was primarily driven by increases in the number of patients on Recorlev. As Paul mentioned, we continue to see a steady increase in referrals with a 30% increase over the fourth quarter. Additionally, over 30% of our patients in the first quarter were prescribed Recorlev as their first drug therapy. We believe that health care professionals are valuing Recorlev as a first-line treatment for Cushing's syndrome post surgery.In addition to total product revenue of $32.3 million, we recognized $900,000 of revenue from collaborations and partnerships. Additionally, we were pleased to announce another partnership with Regeneron in March. Looking ahead for the full year 2023, we affirm our guidance of total revenue between $135 million to $165 million.Moving down the P&amp;L. Cost of goods sold was $5.3 million, a $1 million decrease compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease was attributable to a one-time contract credit and favorable product mix, offset by an increase in product sales. Research and development expenses was $4.3 million, a $1.4 million decrease compared to the same period last year. This decrease was driven by lower product development costs in the period. We continue to practice disciplined prioritization and are focusing our 2023 R&amp;D on funding the levothyroxine program, the completion of the Recorlev OPTICS study and continued development work of our proprietary formulation science.We expect these initiatives to drive modest year-over-year increases in R&amp;D expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $33.6 million, a $2.3 million decrease compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by no restructuring expense in 2023 when compared to 2022. As we discussed in March, we continue to expect total SG&amp;A to be relatively flat in 2023 when compared to 2022. From a cash perspective, as of March 31, 2023, we had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $95 million, compared to $122 million at December 31, 2022.Consistent with our experience in prior years and reflected in our March commentary, cash utilization in the first quarter was higher due to changes in working capital. Reiterating our position for March, we expect cash utilization utilization to moderate through the middle of 2023 until the fourth quarter when we expect to achieve cash flow breakeven.With that said, we are affirming our guidance of total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to end the year in the range of $45 million to $65 million, and cash utilized from operating activities to be between 57 and $77 million. Assuming we are performing to our guidance, we project to reach cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter 2023, and from that point on, we will be a self-sustaining enterprise. As we have discussed, we do not plan to raise capital to fund our operations as we become a self-sustaining enterprise.Operator, please open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question for today comes from Oren Livnat of H.C. Wainwright.Oren Gabriel LivnatCongrats on a good quarter. I have a few. On guidance, you reiterated a solid growth year-over-year. And I'm just trying to get some help on the range of that. It's still quite wide and you haven't narrowed it 1/3 of the way through the year. So could you just remind us the major pushes and pulls there? And also, I can't remember who'd mentioned this in the past, but at the top end, does that include revenue recognition potentially for the Horizon formulation? And I have a follow-up.Paul R. EdickOren, this is Paul. The answer to the second part of your question is. Yes, it does include that revenue. In terms of the breadth of the range, we said back in March when we established the range, that as the year progresses and we see how Keveyis plays out and how the generic plays out and we'll know if we can tighten the range. But there's a lot of unknowns right now.Oren Gabriel LivnatOkay. On Gvoke, you highlighted the share gains that you've been impressive, maybe even accelerating recently. And I'm just wondering, firstly, with the sale of [vaccine,] do you think that's going to have any impact on the competitive dynamics in the space, whether they'll get better, worse or stay the same? And like you highlighted, there was a pretty strong quarter-over-quarter into your seasonally toughest one. So can you comment, first of all, were gross to net better than expected in the first quarter? And actually, should we expect that to improve through the year as we've normally seen.Paul R. EdickSteve?Steven M. PieperYes, I can answer the second question, Oren. The gross to net, as we said kind of midway through last year, they've kind of moderated, and it kind of leveled off. So no, that's not driving it. We don't expect that to improve over the course of 2023.Oren Gabriel LivnatOkay. And lastly on...Paul R. EdickTo the first part of your question on Gvoke, we need, and we have said all along that we want our voices in this marketplace in order to get more market growth. I think the value that really extracted for their product speaks to the potential for the category and having somebody who is dedicated to endocrinology and to the category, I think, can only help. So we're anticipating another voice in the marketplace will increase the market growth, and that will benefit us in the long run.Oren Gabriel LivnatGreat. And on OpEx, they were both actually quite light. I was surprised to see SG&amp;A down despite, I think it was the fourth quarter sales force expansion. Can you just talk about, I guess, how lumpy that is going forward? I know you gave sort of full year characterization. But did you actually trim some core costs across the board?Steven M. PieperNo, not at all. We're expecting SG&amp;A for the full year to be relatively flat. I mean, there could be some lumpiness in terms of marketing promotional spend quarter-to-quarter. But by and large, we look at it from a full year perspective, Oren, it's going to be relatively flat compared to 2022.Oren Gabriel LivnatAnd R&amp;D, it sounds like you said you're focusing on levothyroxine. Is the current run rate until that Phase 2 really kicks in here pretty good to go on R&amp;D?Steven M. PieperYes. On R&amp;D, I would expect to see a slight uptick in Q2 and for the balance of the year when you're looking at it from a quarter-over-quarter perspective, primarily in the second half of that Phase II levo program really kicks in.OperatorOur next question from today comes from Glen Santangelo of Jefferies.Glen Joseph SantangeloPaul, I also want to follow-up on these reimbursement dynamics for Gvoke here in 1Q, right? Because if I look at your scripts, right, they were up 10%, and I think there was a price increase, so we can maybe flesh out the reimbursement dynamics a little bit more. But I would have thought with the scripts being as strong as they were, the revenues would have been a little bit better than flat versus -- sequentially versus 4Q. So if you could flesh that out a little bit, that would be great.Steven M. PieperGlen, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So yes, what we saw in the first quarter, we're working pretty proactively with our wholesalers. And I think there was a little bit of shift in channel inventory in the first quarter, and that happens from time-to-time. The -- our wholesalers will tighten up their inventory a bit. If they swing that one or two weeks within the quarter, it makes a difference, and that's what we saw really. But nothing unusual and nothing concerning about that. That just happens from time-to-time.Glen Joseph SantangeloOkay. And then with respect to Keveyis, this is kind of four quarters in a row with revs roughly about $13 million. And I think you said, Paul, in your prepared remarks, right, you're not really seeing any evidence of any generic competition. So absent that generic competition, is this kind of roughly the right run rate for this product that we should be thinking about? Or based on sort of your marketing plans, do you see a bigger opportunity here? How should we think about the growth of that product going forward, sort of absent any incremental generic competition?Paul R. EdickYes, that's a good question. The -- we're -- we need -- we're taking kind of a wait and see on that. The potential for Keveyis, we think, is significantly higher. And without a generic or without the threat of a generic, we would add resources and drive Keveyis even harder. Right now, we're driving Keveyis as hard as we can with the current resources that we have and generating good solid quarter-over-quarter every single quarter, like you said, $13 million-ish. And we need to see how the whole generic thing plays out and what they do relative to payers and discounting and rebating, and whether or not a second generic enters the market. If -- and then we also have to see if we are successful in our patent application and the appeal that we have going on in the middle of this year. So as things play out, we could substantially upsize our effort and drive a lot more Keveyis over time. But that's just not in the cards right now.OperatorOur next question today comes from Roanna Ruiz of SVB Securities.Roanna Clarissa H. RuizSo a quick question on Recorlev. I was curious if you could update us on, if you're seeing anything around how long the titration process has been for patients as physicians get more comfortable, could that titration period possibly get shorter and you can get patients on drug more quickly?Paul R. EdickYes. Good question, Roanna. We are starting to see more titration, we're seeing the average dose start to creep up, and that's a very good sign. The other thing that we're seeing is the maximum dose, we're not getting to the higher doses that we thought, which I think is also a good sign the drug is working and physicians are starting to use it even for drug-naive patients. So all good signs, and we are starting to see the titration. Whether or not it's going to happen faster versus slower over time, we don't have enough to understand that yet.Roanna Clarissa H. RuizGot it. Okay. And then I wanted to ask a bit more about your new collaboration with Regeneron. Basically, could you give us a rundown of what makes you really excited about this program and the opportunity for possibly multiple products? And when might we get more clarity on future steps or milestones around these programs?Paul R. EdickSo there's a lot -- we would love to talk about that we just can't talk about. But what excites us about the Regeneron deal is, it's a platform deal. I mean, Regeneron is starting out with identification of two products or molecules that they want to put into our system. The status of which -- we're just getting started. I mean, I think they just -- we're just having kickoff meetings and things like that to start the formulation of the first molecule and then the second molecule to follow on soon. The real interesting part is they can nominate additional molecules down the road for formulation and continued development.So the degree to which it could become a platform of products in our formulation is very exciting. And when you think about it, each one of those molecules, depending on if they take them forward into clinical development and eventual approval and commercialization, each one comes with its own set of milestones and both development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties. So the eventual value could be very significant.OperatorOur next question today comes from David Amsellem of Piper Sandler.Unidentified AnalystThis is Skyler on for David. First, I was wondering, can you talk about the kind of patients who were getting Recorlev? Are they mainly those with prior exposure that received ketoconazole? Can you just speak to the overall patient mix? And then also what your view is on the potential commercial impact on Recorlev of Corcept's next-generation cortisol modulator relacorilant, and if you see that as posing a challenge to Recorlev at all?Paul R. EdickSkyler, I will take the second half first. We don't expect the next-generation anytime soon. Corcept product and one would expect that it would probably just cannibalize the product that they have. We're not seeing that as an additional big competitor in the marketplace. To your first question, in terms of patient mix, we tried to hit that in our prepared remarks. We're very excited about the patient mix, because it's not just patients coming from keto. If patients coming from predominantly two areas. One, other products in very specifically Korlym, because we have a product that is very effective at normalizing cortisol, Korlym doesn't do that.And we've got -- we're getting patients from Isturisa and others. The really exciting piece is about 30% of the patients we're getting have not been on any drug, that we're the first drug therapy post surgery. That sets physicians are more and more and very quickly, we're only a year into this, that one year into experience with Recorlev, physicians are using Recorlev first-line therapy. That's very exciting. So we think the patient mix is surprisingly positive. We did anticipate getting more of the uncontrolled or patients who have been through several products. But the mix we're getting is really good, bodes very well for the future of the drug.OperatorWe have no further questions, so I would like to hand back to the management team for any closing remarks.Paul R. EdickThank you very much. Thanks all for joining us. What you heard today confirms once again that we have a durable business on its way to being self-sustaining, through continued revenue growth, careful allocation of resources and prudent expense management, we expect to cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter. And by achieving that milestone prove we can be self-sustaining biopharmaceutical company. I'd also like to take this time to thank all of our patients and caregivers for their support and also the Xeris team for the tireless work that they've done over the last several years through just about every headwind you could imagine. We're very excited about our business and very excited about our future prospects. So thank you very much, and have a great day.OperatorThank you all for joining. That concludes today's Xeris Biopharma Holdings' first quarter 2023 financial results call. Have a great rest of your day, and you may now disconnect.]"

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the World.The immunotherapy industry is a rapidly growing field that is focused on developing treatments that harness the power of the immune system to fight cancer and other diseases. Many companies are involved in the immunotherapy industry, ranging from large pharmaceutical companies to small biotechnology startups. These companies are working to create a range of different immunotherapy treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. According to Markets and Markets, the revenue of the global immunotherapy drugs market was estimated to be $163.0 billion in 2020. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0% from 2020 to 2025, reaching a value of $274.6 billion by 2025. The global immunotherapy drugs market is classified based on therapeutic areas into cancer, autoimmune &amp; inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, and other therapeutic areas. Among these, cancer held the largest share of the global immunotherapy drugs market in 2019. The dominance of this segment is attributable to the high incidence of cancer, increasing research efforts in this field, and the provision of reimbursement coverage for oncology immunotherapies.The size of the global cancer immunotherapy industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% from $85.6 billion in 2020 to $309.67 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. The National Cancer Institute reported that in 2020, around 1,806,590 new cancer cases were reported in the United States, and 606,520 people died from the disease. Researchers believe that this rise in cancer incidence is expected to drive the growth of the immunotherapy industry in the coming years. In 2020, North America contributed the highest revenue to the cancer immunotherapy market due to increased expenditure on healthcare, a focus on maintaining a top healthcare system, and a rising incidence of cancer worldwide. Asia-Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to exhibit the highest CAGR during 2021-2030, primarily due to a surge in per capita income and an improvement in healthcare infrastructure.Story continuesSome of the key players in the immunotherapy industry include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Roche Holdings AG (ROG.SW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). These companies are investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) to bring new immunotherapy treatments to the market. The industry has witnessed significant progress in recent years in developing effective immunotherapies for various diseases. However, there are also challenges in the development of these treatments, including managing potential side effects and ensuring that they are accessible and affordable to patients worldwide.15 Biggest Immunotherapy Companies in the WorldPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 15 biggest immunotherapy companies in the world, we compiled a comprehensive list of companies that have a significant presence in the immunotherapy industry.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) became a household name during the pandemic as one of the first developers of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the stock sold off sharply as COVID momentum, including high expectations for booster shots, began to wear off, causing investors to slash its fiscal 2023 earnings estimates by two-thirds over the last year. We believe those downward revisions clouded the prospects for the company’s fully funded pipeline of platform opportunities, including cancer, RSV and flu. The cash-rich company also recently expanded its partnership with Merck to improve cancer treatments.”13. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK)Market Capitalization: $52.65 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 11Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK) is a Tokyo, Japan-based pharmaceutical company developing state-of-the-art therapies for a range of different diseases, including oncology.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Market Capitalization: $107.05 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company. In a research note issued on February 14, Salim Syed at Mizuho increased the target for Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9. Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)Market Capitalization: $142.81 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is a Paris, France-based biopharmaceutical company working on creating groundbreaking therapies for a range of diseases.

Here’s what the firm said:“Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), which we referenced above, boasts a double digit free cash flow yield that gets divided roughly equally between repurchases, a dividend and M&amp;A in what is the best environment for acquisitions perhaps ever. In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”7. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Market Capitalization: $220.6 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a Basel, Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in the area of immunotherapy.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Following our significant achievements in 2022, Regeneron is off to a good start in 2023, highlighted by important regulatory and pipeline advances, commercial execution and prudent capital allocation, all of which position better the company to deliver sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value over time. George, Mary and Bob will cover details of our first quarter performance in a few moments. In the meantime, I would provide an update on our goal of continuing to grow our business while simultaneously diversifying our revenue and earnings streams, which is part of our long-term vision for Regeneron. We have made substantial progress toward achieving that goal.Over the past four years, while total revenues have nearly doubled, EYLEA accounted for only 57% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 88% of total revenues for the year 2019. Driven primarily by the growth of DUPIXENT, our Sanofi collaboration accounted for 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to only 6% of our total revenues in 2019. We expect this trend of revenue growth, along with diversification to continue. For example, assuming the approval and successful launch of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which has a June 27 PDUFA date, EYLEA 2 milligrams is expected to become a smaller share of our revenues, while aflibercept 8 milligrams is expected to contribute to overall revenue growth. In addition, DUPIXENT remains in a high-growth mode, with global net product sales up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all 5 approved indications.We believe the positive Phase III results for DUPIXENT in the subpopulation of COPD patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as well as the promising results for our IL-33 antibody itepekimab in former smokers represent additional significant opportunities to accelerate revenue growth as well as diversification. Our oncology portfolio is also starting to make a meaningful contribution to our top line, with last year's acquisition of full global rights to Libtayo and the recent launch of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, we believe that fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with Libtayo, has the potential to become an important therapy in both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where we have already advanced to pivotal studies.We are also quite excited about the emerging clinical profile for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. Updated data for which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting. We remain on track to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval in late-stage myeloma later this year. We continue to invest in our research and development engine and expect it will deliver new differentiated medicines that will drive organic growth over time. Our broad development pipeline of nearly 3 dozen programs spans many different therapeutic areas and modalities, notably: Our co-stimulatory bispecifics in cancer; our early pipeline in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; as well as our collaborations with Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel and others are expected to drive medium- and long-term revenue growth, profitability and diversification.Before handing over to George, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the contributions that Dr. Roy Vagelos has made to Regeneron over the nearly three decades that he has served as our Board Chair. Over the years, he has provided invaluable guidance and he continues to inspire us as we work to turn world-class science into medicines. Roy will retire from the Board after his current term ends next month. At that time, in addition to our current roles in the company, George and I will be appointed by the Board to serve as co-Chairs, and Christine Poon, a member of Regeneron board since 2010, will be appointed as the board's Lead Independent Director. With that, let me turn the call over to George.George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive DUPIXENT Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. Starting with DUPIXENT. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that DUPIXENT was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. DUPIXENT-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: an impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease.We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in IL-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a DUPIXENT benefit in COPD.The BOREAS COPD data indicates that DUPIXENT can help even more patients beyond the 5 current FDA-approved indications and diseases caused or exacerbated by type 2 inflammation, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. We are also expecting an FDA decision for DUPIXENT for chronic spontaneous urticaria on October 22, 2023, and we are continuing to tailor DUPIXENT development to patients with other type 2 inflammatory diseases, most likely to be responsive to this method. Moving to oncology. With the progress of our late and early stage pipeline, we are looking forward to several important milestones this year. Starting with Libtayo. In addition to expanded use in lung cancer, Libtayo was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment of CSCC.The Libtayo U.S. label was also recently updated with more mature CSCC and BCC data, supporting its differentiated clinical profile in these tumor settings and satisfying all post-marketing commitments that require full approval in these indications. Regarding our exciting new combinations with Libtayo. Starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibodies, for which we are planning a broad pivotal program spanning several cancer indications. These efforts were triggered by our robust and confirmed data in first-line metastatic melanoma patients, which will be presented in further detail at ASCO, suggesting that the fianlimab-Libtayo combination could produce about double the response rates with longer progression-free survival, the anti-PD monotherapy standard.Based on this, we have already initiated pivotal trials in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, and we will start a study in perioperative melanoma in the second half of the year. In addition, based on promising data in small patient cohorts, we started a seamless Phase II/III pivotal study for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and we will soon start a Phase II study in the perioperative setting. Next, the bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo. Earlier this year, ASCO's GU represented initial positive first-in-human data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer, the tumor type considered immunologically cold and largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy alone.Over the next 12 months we plan to present updated PSMAxCD28 data in more patients, some of which will have been prophylactically treated with our anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, sarilumab, to potentially reduce the severity of immune-mediated side effects while maintaining or improving antitumor activity. Also during this time frame, we plan to present data in advanced ovarian cancer for both our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in our MUC16xCD3 co-stimulatory bispecific as well as data in several tumor types from our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, or in combination with Libtayo. Our hematology oncology pipeline continues to advance. In an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting, we will present updated data for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific tested in late-line multiple myeloma.We believe these data will show that linvoseltamab has the best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety and a favorable dosing schedule in the competitive environment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatment candidates. We remain on track for a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of this year for linvoseltamab. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are on track to complete U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second half of this year. Odronextamab in late-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile, and our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved our generic safety profile without impacting efficacy.Pharmacy, Medicine, HealthPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashAlso, we have initiated a first-in-human study of our CD20xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, which we hope could further improve upon the anticancer benefit for these patients. Now to genetics medicines. Starting with our collaboration with Alnylam, and siRNA therapeutics. Just last week, we and Alnylam announced an important update for our Alnylam APP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, an siRNA therapeutic demonstrates sustained silencing of a pathological gene in the central nerve system in a clinical trial. In the earnings call this morning, our Alnylam collaborators provided additional details on these results. Our siRNA approach aims to prevent production of amyloid precursor protein as opposed to clearing existing amyloid plaques after they have already formed, providing a new way to potentially address Alzheimer's disease, which will still have a devastating impact on patients and their families even with the emergence of amyloid-clearing antibodies.Patients treated with single dose of ALN-APP experienced dose-dependent, rapid and sustained reduction of up to 90% in APP production as assessed by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. The safety and tolerability profile with single dosing is encouraging so far. While the multi-dose Part B portion of the study is on partial clinical hold in the United States due to finding reserved in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies, Part B has already received regulatory approval to proceed in Canada, where the majority of the part A clinical trial patients had been enrolled. Detailed results from the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting. We are looking forward to advancing additional development candidates for the many other neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few or no therapeutic options such as other targets for Alzheimer's as well as for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's.In addition to these exciting developments in central nervous system diseases, we are continuing our progress with liver targeted medicines, including our broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We're enrolling a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors, continuing in development of ALN-PNP, and we are planning to progress additional more recently genetically validated NASH targets as well. Finally, I would like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics' discover, develop and commercialize regulatory T cell therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This collaboration will bring together our industry-leading technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies and T cell receptors, as well as our additional biologics candidates with Sonoma's pioneering approach to developing and manufacturing gene modified T reg cell therapies.In conclusion, Regeneron's R&amp;D engine truly continues its productivity in both late and early-stage pipeline. Before turning the call over to Marion, I would also like to thank Roy Vagelos for serving as a role model for all of us at Regeneron as well as for so many others across the industry. I hope that we can continue to live up to the high stage that Roy has set over his distinguished career. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. Our first quarter performance demonstrates ongoing leadership across multiple therapeutic categories. Taken together, our in-market brands anticipated near-term launches and extensive development pipeline uniquely position Regeneron to expand our leadership across multiple disease areas. First quarter EYLEA U.S. net product sales declined 6% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, EYLEA U.S. net product sales decreased 4%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher demand volume, offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels, higher sales-related deductions and increasing competitive pressure. EYLEA captured approximately 70% branded share in the first quarter.Based on presentations at scientific meetings, the retina community has expressed increasing enthusiasm about Regeneron's portfolio with the aflibercept 8-milligram PDUFA date, now 7 weeks away. EYLEA is the well-established gold standard anti-VEGF treatment and aflibercept 8-milligram has the potential to be as paradigm changing as EYLEA when it was introduced more than a decade ago. In clinical trials of aflibercept 8-milligram demonstrated improvements in visual acuity with less frequent injections and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA, exactly what retina specialists have told us they need in a next-generation medicine. Launch preparations are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this important treatment option to patients following FDA approval.On Libtayo, which is foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio, first quarter global net product sales grew 49% on a constant currency basis, reaching $183 million, which includes $6 million from Sanofi transition sales in international markets. In the U.S., net sales grew 39% to $110 million. Libtayo continues to lead the market in both advanced CSCC and advanced BCC as demand volume increases. Following last November's FDA approval of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, new patient starts have accelerated as physicians of Libtayo has an important new treatment option, initiatives to raise brand awareness and improve access have driven share gains in both the academic and community settings.Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 67% on a constant currency basis to $73 million, driven by steadily increasing demand and additional country launches. The European Commission recently approved Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive lung cancer, and we are in the process of securing access and reimbursement for this new indication. Turning to DUPIXENT. First quarter global net sales grew 40% on a constant currency basis to $2.49 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 43% to $1.9 billion, with notable volume growth across all approved indications. Driven by its outstanding efficacy and safety profile, DUPIXENT is the number one prescribed biologic for new patients in all 5 of its approved indications. In atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT is the leading systemic treatment based on its unique mechanism of action, clinical profile and real world experience.Strong prescribing trends continue across moderate and severe disease and across approved age ranges. There's also significant opportunity to further increase market penetration as DUPIXENT is uniquely positioned to provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients 6 months and older. In prurigo nodularis, DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved systemic treatment. Launch update is progressing well, and we anticipate ongoing growth as we leverage our dermatology commercialization capabilities for patients in need. Across the competitive asthma space, DUPIXENT continues to gain market share as naive and biologic switch patients are initiated on treatment. DUPIXENT also continues to capture the majority of market demand in nasal polyps with increased prescribing from allergists and ENTs. Our cytosolic esophagitis launch is exceeding expectations.In the first year following U.S. approval, more than 11,000 patients have initiated therapy, demonstrating extensive unmet patient need and our strong launch execution and collaboration with Sanofi. Both gastroenterologist and analogists have embraced DUPIXENTas the new standard of care setting meaningful improvements in disease symptoms and quality of life for those now on therapy. A new patient campaign is underway to raise awareness of the scientific advancements in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENTnet sales were $587 million, growing 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across approved indications and launches in new geographies. Recent European approvals of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in young children are expected to contribute to DUPIXENT’s ongoing growth.In summary, our commercial portfolio continues to diversify across many serious medical conditions and delivered solid results in the quarter. Moving forward, we are well positioned to serve even more patients driven by the strength of our existing portfolio, coupled with anticipated launches that have the potential to advance standards of care. With that, I'll turn the call to Bob.Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the first quarter of 2023 with solid financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion as DUPIXENT and Libtayo contribute to increasingly diversified revenue and earning streams. First quarter diluted net income per share was $10.09 on net income of $1.2 billion, which included a previously announced $0.42 impact of acquired IPR&amp;D. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $847 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2022.Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $357 million, of which $332 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $798 million in the first quarter and grew 26% versus last year's first quarter, which included a $50 million sales milestone that did not recur this year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $637 million, an increase of 53% versus the prior year. We continue to see increasing profitability from our antibody collaboration and expect further margin expansion as we begin to realize drug substance yield improvements from a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $222 million in the first quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract.We do not expect to record any additional revenue from Ronapreve in 2023, absent a new contract. Moving now to operating expenses. First quarter 2023 R&amp;D expense increased 28% year-over-year to $960 million as we continue to invest in our pipeline to drive organic growth. The increase in R&amp;D was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's growing pipeline, which now encompasses approximately 35 programs in clinical development in more than 15 ongoing late-stage studies with additional study starts expected this year. These late-stage programs include our expanding fianlimab development program, upcoming Phase III studies and early reliance for our hem/onc assets, as well as ongoing development programs for DUPIXENT and itepekimab for which we now record our full 50% share of development costs as a result of the Libtayo transaction.SG&amp;A expense increased 32% year-over-year to $515 million due to higher contributions to an independent, not-for-profit patient assistance organization, higher headcount and related costs, and the impact of the Libtayo transaction. First quarter 2023 COCM was $249 million, up 26% versus last year, due to increases in shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi and manufacturing costs for Dupixent. Reimbursements for these production costs are recorded as part of other revenue in Sanofi collaboration revenue respectively. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of $12.3 billion.We have continued to strategically deploy our cash to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, which are focused on investing in innovation, both internal and external, as well as returning capital to shareholders. We purchased nearly $700 million of our shares in the first quarter with $3.1 billion remaining under our existing authorization as of March 31. Additionally, as George discussed, we announced the collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, investing $75 million through an upfront payment and equity investment to add a new approach to our scientific capabilities. I'd like to conclude with some select updates to our financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We are updating 2023 COCM guidance to be in the range of $820 million to $880 million, an increase of $90 million at the midpoint, reflecting increased shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies for Praluent and DUPIXENT to Sanofi.Importantly, these anticipated incremental expenses will be reimbursed by Sanofi, generally resulting in a neutral impact to Regeneron's 2023 operating profit. Approximately half of the incremental $90 million of reimbursements from Sanofi are expected to be recorded as Sanofi collaboration revenue, with the balance recorded as other revenue. As a result, we now expect 2023 other revenue to be higher than 2022 other revenue. For modeling purposes, second quarter 2023 other revenue is expected to be the lowest of the 2023 quarters, with the vast majority of the remaining other revenue to be recorded in the second half of this year. We are also updating our 2023 gross margin to be between 89% to 91%. The change in expected gross margin is primarily driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, as well as an increase in the start-up costs associated with our new fill/finish facility located in upstate New York.Finally, we are lowering our guidance for our effective tax rate to 10% to 12%, reflecting the benefit of higher than previously anticipated stock-based compensation deductions. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in the first quarter of 2023, and the company remains well positioned to drive further growth in the remainder of the year and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Josh, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&amp;A.

(NASDAQ:REGN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.52bUS$4.19bUS$4.56bUS$4.90bUS$5.42bUS$5.78bUS$6.08bUS$6.34bUS$6.57bUS$6.78bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 6.55%Est @ 5.22%Est @ 4.29%Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$4.2kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$146bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$146b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$75bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$113b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$752, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?
