The bearish inventory numbers, together with high production and predictions of insipid weather-related demand, dragged down natural gas futures, which settled with a fourth consecutive loss week over week.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Nov 24, in contrast to the guidance of a 10 Bcf withdrawal, per a survey conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The increase compared with the five-year (2018-2022) average net shrinkage of 44 Bcf and last year’s decline of 80 Bcf for the reported week.The unexpected build put total natural gas stocks at 3,836 Bcf, which is 341 Bcf (9.8%) above the 2022 level and 303 Bcf (8.6%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 111.9 Bcf per day, up 1.1 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to higher shipments from Canada and an increase in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption rose to 128.1 Bcf from 110.1 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a surge in residential/commercial usage as well as higher power burn and industrial consumption.', 'Natural gas prices trended downward last week following the unseasonal inventory increase. Futures for January delivery ended Friday at $2.81 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating some 6.2% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is also the result of high supply and mild weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With mild weather across major parts of the United States and forecasts for above-normal temperature in the longer term, usage of the commodity to generate electricity is expected to be tepid.As it is, natural gas is under pressure from near-record output, with current inventory levels well above the year-ago figure and the five-year average. The full restart of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas is also likely to contribute significantly toward the global supply picture. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by a blast in June last year and has been functioning only partially since its resumption in February. \xa0Having said all of that, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down some 25% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, recently reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.', 'Following last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down more than 37% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for holding on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of the Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 33.6%. Valued at around $7.9 billion, RRC has gained 29.8% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%. Valued at around $19.7 billion, CTRA has edged down 0.2% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 602.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter’s 2023 earnings has been revised 17.3% upward over the past 60 days.

While pockets of opportunity can be found in equities, we consider that fixed income offers better opportunity given current rates and our expected path of growth and future rates.""', 'US navigates a ""soft"" but fragile landing', '""Over the past year, global economies have exhibited surprising resilience in the face of the sharpest tightening cycle experienced in decades, with the US economy showing impressive strength. While many regions could be set to benefit from a soft landing, it will depend heavily on central banks’ policies,"" said Michael Arone, Chief Investment Strategist for the US SPDR Business.', 'The firm’s base case is that central banks will move more quickly to lower policy rates than markets are anticipating, particularly in the US. However, the firm expects any soft landing to be fragile and subject to the strategy of central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve. If central banks continue with their hawkish position, this soft landing could be jeopardized.', 'Escalating geopolitical conflicts also present a key risk. Going into 2024, the shifting geopolitical landscape – from uncertainty around international and trade relations, conflicts, and the ability of upcoming elections to reshape political rhetoric – all warrant close monitoring and agility in portfolio positioning.', 'Simona Mocuta, Chief Economist, added, ""A world of sub-trend growth and ongoing disinflation will continue to pose challenges for investors since a soft landing is likely, but is not guaranteed.""', 'Bonds take center stage', 'With a potential significant slowdown in economic activity, and continued disinflation, State Street Global Advisors believes fixed income is one of the best-positioned asset classes from a risk/reward standpoint. In particular, it considers that sovereign fixed income – US Treasuries specifically – may be an attractive proposition over the medium term.', '""With rate hikes still filtering through the global economy, we believe an overweight duration position in sovereign debt, namely US Treasuries, will enable investors to price in lower rates and a bullish steepening next year,"" said Matt Nest, Global Head of Active Fixed Income.', 'Within fixed income, State Street Global Advisors expects a slowing economy and advancing credit cycle to present challenges to corporate income and balance sheets.

The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microchip Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.357. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Starting in 2008, they have been aggressively drawing on FHLBs, arguing they support housing because they invest in residential mortgages and related securities.', 'The extent to which FHLBs finance insurers has not been previously reported. Reuters interviews with more than a dozen industry executives and regulators, a review of regulatory disclosures and data show this borrowing has not been matched by a rise in home loan affordability, with the cost of mortgages soaring to its highest in 23 years.', 'The practice has been lucrative for insurance firms that have locked in billions of dollars in profits by investing the borrowed money in areas such as commercial real estate mortgages and corporate and government bonds. It has been predominantly used by life insurers, because they need to boost their investment returns with cheap funding to meet long-term liabilities.', 'FHLBs typically have a lower cost of borrowing than what is otherwise commercially available, because these banks enjoy an implicit U.S. taxpayer-backed guarantee on their debt. They provide the cheap funding to banks and insurers in exchange for collateral to ensure they get their money back.', 'A spokesperson for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the FHLBs, declined to comment specifically on insurers tapping FHLBs, but said the regulator was considering implementing new requirements for borrowing from FHLBs to ensure the support of housing and community development. They declined to provide more details.', 'Ryan Donovan, president and CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, a trade association for FHLBs, said the banks have ""abided by the will of Congress"" to provide liquidity and support affordable housing.', 'BORROWING BILLIONS', 'FHLBs lent a record $137.1 billion to life insurance firms last year, building on a trend that started around 2008, according to the FHLB Office of finance.', ""Yet the industry's investments in home mortgages have dropped. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) data shows that insurance companies have been buying fewer residential-backed mortgage securities (RMBS), which boost liquidity in the home mortgage market, while purchases of commercial-mortgage backed securities (CMBS) have been steady."", 'In 2022, life insurance companies bought $193.1 billion worth of RMBS, down 6% from $205.3 billion in 2021, as soaring inflation soured their appetite to invest more. In contrast, their appetite for CMBS remained steady, with purchases totaling $203.6 billion in 2022, almost flat compared to $204.7 billion in 2021.', 'Lawrence White, an economics professor at New York University who recently co-authored research about FHLBs, said insurers did not need to borrow from FHLBs to invest in mortgages in the first place.', '""It\'s an artifact of the 1930s that insurance companies are part of the FHLB system,"" White said.', 'MetLife Inc, Equitable Holdings Inc, TIAA, Corebridge Financial and Brighthouse Financial Inc are among the insurance firms that are prolific users of FHLB funding, their regulatory filings show.', 'MetLife, TIAA, Corebridge, Brighthouse and Equitable declined to comment.', 'JUICING RETURNS', 'Cynthia Beaulieu, a managing director and portfolio manager at Conning, which manages $205 billion in assets for investors such as insurance companies, said a majority of her clients use FHLB loans to generate extra returns because ""the arbitrage was really attractive.""', 'Life insurers can lock in returns between 85 and 140 basis points by taking FHLB loans and investing the money in pools of loans such as collateralized loan obligations, Wellington Management, a Boston-based investment manager, said on its website in July. A percentage point is 100 basis points.', ""Insurers are entitled to tap FHLB funding. Yet U.S. taxpayers are backstopping the insurance industry's profits with little to show, said Cornelius Hurley, a lecturer at the Boston University School of Law and a member of the Coalition for FHLB Reform, a group that calls for changes to the FHLB system to address unmet housing needs."", '""All (insurers) do is they happen to have some government securities and mortgage-backed securities in their investment portfolios. But they don’t provide any public benefit in return for that,"" Hurley said.', 'AIDED BY REGULATORS', 'To be sure, banks have also been stepping up their borrowing from FHLBs to tap cheap funding. An FHFA report published last month showed how some troubled regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic, were using FHLBs as lender of last resort, encouraging risk-taking that hastened their collapse.', 'Insurers’ borrowing from FHLBs picked up in 2008 financial crisis, as those that spread themselves thin with aggressive investments scrambled for cash. Subsequent regulatory changes emboldened insurers to borrow more.', 'The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which sets policy that many state insurance regulators follow, allowed insurers in 2009 to treat FHLB borrowing as ""operating leverage"" rather than debt, as long as they use the money for investments.', 'This gives insurers more room to saddle themselves with more with debt, because borrowing from FHLBs weighs less on their capital ratios than commercial borrowing, FHLB officials, analysts and economists say. It can also give them a more favorable credit rating, allowing them to borrow more debt at cheaper rates.', 'In 2018, the NAIC again made FHLB borrowing more attractive for insurance companies, by requiring them to hold less money aside for every dollar they borrow from FHLBs.', 'The NAIC declined to comment.', 'The reduced capital charges can more than double insurers’ return on investments from FHLB loans, according to FHLB Chicago. On its website, it gives examples of how insurers can borrow from it to invest in commercial mortgage securities, rather than residential mortgage securities that benefit the housing market directly.', ""Michael Ericson, the president and CEO of FHLB Chicago, said the use of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities as collateral for FHLB loans helps maintain the FHLBs' nexus to housing finance."", 'Insurers have lobbied to maintain the current arrangement. The American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) and the Insurance Coalition wrote to the FHFA in letters reviewed by Reuters, arguing that curbing their FHLB borrowing would remove liquidity from the market for mortgages. They did not explain why insurers need FHLB funding to invest in mortgages.', 'ACLI spokesman Jack Dolan said that life insurers\' FHLB borrowings represented a small fraction of the $8.3 trillion in assets held by the industry, and that tapping FHLBs was ""part of prudent, long-term risk management strategies."" The Insurance Coalition did not respond to a request for comment.', '(Reporting by Koh Qui Ging in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Anna Driver)']"

SEE has made great progress to advance or design more than 51% of its portfolio to be recyclable or reusable and to incorporate an average of 17% recycled or renewable content into our solutions. We are now forecasting that both the market demand and the material supply to achieve our pledge are taking longer than anticipated.

Intentionally focused on the celebration and preservation of heritage craft, the Artist in Residence program is part of the Company’s broader efforts to shift from inspiration to collaboration with communities that have inspired Ralph Lauren. The collaboration with Glasses, a seventh-generation Diné (Navajo) textile artist and weaver, is the first of more to come.', 'Ralph Lauren’s design ethos has long been inspired by the lands, cultures and artistry that make up the fabric of America. Aligned with its commitment to reexamine what and who is included in its depiction of the American experience, the Company has been on a journey to amplify diverse stories, deepen its sources of inspiration, and ultimately, form creative partnerships within the communities that inspire its designs. In 2020, Ralph Lauren set out to expand its collegiate sensibility to include the prestige and dressing traditions of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), resulting in its first HBCU collaboration with Morehouse College and Spelman College. Similarly, the Company sought to collaborate with Indigenous artisans, whose heritage craft is an important part of American art and cultural identity.', '""Heritage and tradition are at the center of everything I love — things that encompass both beauty and utility, that are uncontrived and personal and are passed down for generations,"" said Ralph Lauren, Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of Ralph Lauren Corporation. ""Bringing the most authentic expression of heritage craft to life means working with those who have created and sustained these timeless traditions for centuries and sharing their stories with the world. That is the opportunity that awaits us — and that will be a valued part of the legacy of our Company.""', 'The Polo Ralph Lauren x Naiomi Glasses Collection will be unveiled to consumers as three seasonal, special-edition product launches through 2024 that celebrate the artistry of timeless Navajo traditions through the lens of Naiomi Glasses. The first capsule includes men’s, women’s and unisex apparel and accessories in a color palette inspired by the lands of Dinétah (Navajo Nation), where the Glasses family resides. Standout pieces include woven jacquard blanket coats and wraps crafted with the natural colors of undyed wool alongside reinterpretations of Ralph Lauren styles like ranch coats and thicket jackets. Contemporary adaptations of cherished Navajo symbols like spider woman crosses, four-directional crosses, dragonflies and wedge weave motifs are incorporated throughout the collection, reflecting the tradition, innovation and creativity present throughout Navajo culture. Also featured is an assortment of beautifully crafted knits, velvet tops, timeless layering pieces and classic Ralph Lauren silhouettes like the iconic polo shirt and baseball cap that complement Glasses’ personal style.', '""Navajo weaving is a craft that has carried on through my family for seven generations and preserving these traditions in new ways has been so inspiring to me as an artist. To now be able to share it with people around the world, as seen through my eyes and brought to life in clothing, is a dream come true,"" said Naiomi Glasses. ""It is only through the power of collaboration and Ralph Lauren’s unique program that this collection was made possible, and the best part is that it brings traditional Navajo weaving to a new generation.""', 'This story comes to life beyond the product through a powerful campaign shot by Ryan RedCorn (Osage) and Daryn Sells (Diné/Navajo) with behind-the-scenes footage captured by Lonnie Begaye (Diné/Navajo). It features a predominantly Indigenous cast and crew of Glasses’ family, friends and community, set against the striking landscape of Navajo Nation. An anthemic short film directed by award-winning filmmaker Shaandiin Tome (Diné/Navajo) accompanies the campaign, detailing Glasses’ family life, her introduction to the Navajo weaving tradition and sources of inspiration, the making of the collection and more. Ralph Lauren’s external Native and Indigenous Advisory Council, with members from a range of career disciplines and tribal affiliations, advised the Company on the ideation, approach and creation of the campaign as part of its ongoing role to share guidance and insights on representation of and engagement with Indigenous communities.', 'The short film premieres on December 5 on YouTube and select Ralph Lauren social channels. The first of three assortments of the collection is now available to consumers on RalphLauren.com, the Ralph Lauren App, Tmall and in select global stores, while quantities last. Drops two and three of the collection will follow in spring and fall 2024, respectively.', 'Glasses, an avid turquoise and silver collector, curated a unique selection of handcrafted silver and turquoise jewelry from six artisan families throughout the Navajo Nation, Hopi Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo and Zuni Pueblo, showcased throughout the campaign and profiled in RL Magazine. Special pieces from the curation are available for purchase online and in select flagship stores.', 'In line with Ralph Lauren’s commitment to deepen its engagement with Native and Indigenous communities, a percentage of the purchase price from sales of the first drop of the Polo Ralph Lauren x Naiomi Glasses Collection will benefit Change Labs, a Native-led organization focused on fostering the creation of successful Navajo and Hopi small businesses. Full details are available in stores and on RalphLauren.com. This builds on the ongoing efforts by the Company and The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation to preserve cultural heritage and enable access to educational and career opportunities among Native communities through their support of organizations like the American Indian College Fund, Creative Futures Collective, the Institute of American Indian Arts and the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts, among others.', 'ABOUT RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION', 'Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of luxury lifestyle products in five categories: apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances and hospitality.

The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating historical trends and current period performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the Company\'s condensed consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.', 'The Company reports the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), free cash flow, sales changes on a constant currency basis, and adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios.', ""Non-GAAP operating income is a non-GAAP measure defined as operating income excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing operating results to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. Management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. Management also utilizes non-GAAP operating margin, defined as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of total sales, to further evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Company's flexible operating model."", 'Non-GAAP diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure defined as diluted EPS excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing financial results in order to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. In particular, management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. The Company estimates the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a statutory tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the diluted EPS during the period.', 'Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as the net cash used in operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management considers this metric to be helpful in understanding how the business is generating cash from its operating and investing activities that can be used to meet the financing needs of the business. Free cash flow is an indicator frequently used by management in evaluating its overall liquidity needs and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.', ""The Company provides the year-over-year change in total sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to provide transparency to performance and enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends. The effect from foreign currency, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying current year average exchange rates to prior year sales in local currency."", 'The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are non-GAAP measures calculated by dividing Signet\'s adjusted debt or adjusted net debt by adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as debt recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, plus Preferred Shares, plus an adjustment for operating leases (5x annual rent expense). Adjusted net debt, a non-GAAP measure, is adjusted debt less the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the balance sheet dates. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, defined as earnings before interest and income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, other non-operating expense, net and certain non-GAAP accounting adjustments (""Adjusted EBITDA"") and further excludes minimum fixed rent expense for properties occupied under operating leases. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are considered important indicators of operating performance as they exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization costs and certain accounting adjustments. Management believes these financial measures are helpful to investors and analysts to analyze trends in Signet\'s business and evaluate Signet\'s performance. The adjusted debt leverage ratio is a key priority of the Company\'s capital allocation strategy used in measuring the Company\'s optimized capital structure. The adjusted net debt leverage is supplemental to this ratio as it is deemed useful to both investors and management to consider cash on hand available to pay down debt. The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are presented on a trailing twelve-month (""TTM"") basis, which uses Adjusted EBITDAR calculated on the prior four fiscal quarters.', 'The

SLB predicts that new energy should be a $10 billion-a-year business by 2040, up from just from a tiny fraction of that amount now.', 'At the same time, CEO Olivier Le Peuch, a Frenchman who took the reins in 2019 and has been at SLB for decades, said its bread-and-butter oil-fields services business is not going anywhere, predicting that oil and gas will remain dominant in energy production for a long time yet. In that area, SLB hopes to make exploration and extraction more efficient.', '""We need to explain the energy system as it is, and how it will evolve, and recognize that the world today cannot live without oil and gas but at the same time, stand up and to demonstrate our commitment to decarbonization,"" Le Peuch told Fortune.', 'This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.', 'Fortune: Last year, you changed your well-known corporate name to ""SLB"" from ""Schlumberger."" Was that to sound less French? The company does not offer consumer-facing services, so why tinker with a name that is almost 100 years old?', 'This was an opportunity to reset our vision. We had set a strategy in motion four years ago and I think COVID gave us the opportunity to launch that vision and was a branding opportunity to position ourselves as a global technology company with the opportunity to innovate and create both the decarbonization of the current energy system and accelerate solutions for the future.', 'You call SLB a nearly century-old entity a ""tech company."" What makes you a tech company now?', ""It goes back to our roots. For almost 100 years, we've been a science and innovation company with the mandate to put first and foremost research ahead of profit. We have been innovating and inventing new technology for the purpose of performance in energy extraction. There is a priority in accelerating decarbonization and the performance of oil and gas so they can contribute to the energy mix more sustainably, using digital tools for sampling and increasing energy efficiency across the board. The new energy that we need will take decades to come to market and we believe that our contribution will be to deploy technology anywhere we can scale."", 'Help me reconcile two contradictory trends I am hearing. On the one hand, we keep hearing that the climate crisis is urgent and we have to reduce our fossil fuel use immediately, and on the other, many CEOs have told me they think oil and gas consumption will keep rising in absolute terms for decades.', ""We have to commit to reducing emissions from oil and gas exploration, development and production. This is a major action. This starts with abating methane, eliminating flaring and reducing the carbon footprint of operations we provide to our customers, and reducing the energy required to lift, produce, process and transport oil and gas to the market. The second aspect is to produce more efficiently. That's where we use digital tools to be more effective and more productive. And lastly, the plan is to participate in and accelerate renewable and clean energy."", 'Do you ever feel that the oil and gas industry is unfairly reviled in this climate discussion, and do consumers fully understand the implications if society stops using fossil fuels cold turkey?', ""It's not a surprise to us in the industry but I think we need to do a better job of explaining why oil and gas is part of the fabric of society and why there is no substitute in the short term for supplying the energy and the byproducts of gas that the industry provides to the world. This is a reality of today and we must be clear in documenting it. At the same time, we need to do a much better job of showing the action we are taking to commit to decarbonizing emissions. We need to explain the energy system as it is, and it will evolve and recognize that the world today cannot live without oil and gas but at the same time, stand up and to demonstrate our commitment to decarbonization."", 'Given all the push back on the sustainability goals within ESG guidelines, will the desire of your clients to hit those environmental goals weaken?', ""We have set out our goals independently of any ESG pressure or ESG activists. We were the first company in our sector to include Scope 3 emissions for net zero and we did that back in 2020. But we don't like the fact that ESG metrics are not unified, and that they add complexity and a lack of transparency. We more than welcome any initiative that will simplify reporting."", 'New energies are part of your big plan for SLB. But wind and sun power remain relatively small sources, even in countries like Denmark. Why is this key for SLB?', ""We have no choice but to participate in new energy development. We have one or two decades to seed the initiatives organically and using our technology, camera capability, and warehousing adjacency because our customers are going with us in this field of new energy and we are using our geographical footprint to expand and use technology innovation for CCS (carbon capture and storage), for geothermal, for hydrogen and deploy it. We have been in CCS for 25 years and it's still a small portion of our business but it's something that is growing fast. If you combine all these, you realize that you can create a whole new chapter for the company."", ""Given many people's negative views of the oil and gas industry, what is talent attract like for you these days?"", 'I believe our rebranding, vision and position have helped us to really push our company clearly as a global technology company innovating for the future and for a balanced planet. We tap into a talent pool globally. We have not been seeing any setback in the last two or three years in our ability to recruit. People from the new generation are really inspired to some extent by our vision and by the ability to work on solutions, including digital, and things like carbon capture and energy storage, so that is very attractive to them, to work on practical, pragmatic solutions.', 'You were trained as an electrical engineer. Does that help you as a CEO or are firmly just in the world of strategy and execution?', 'I spent the first 10 to 15 years of my career making technology, innovating, and understanding how to transform ideas into an engineered product and how to tap different disciplines to make it work. It also has helped me to better understand the value proposition we can offer to customers. I can then spend the balance my time between guiding the team on the strategy and added insights on the technology.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 12%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NOV ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for NOV compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NOV."", ""You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at NOV. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 10,803% over the trailing five years. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 54% less capital than it was five years ago. NOV may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still."", ""For the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 23% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase."", ""From what we've seen above, NOV has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. And since the stock has fallen 32% over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation."", ""Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:', '12% = US$6.6b ÷ US$57b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, NextEra Energy has a superior ROE than the average (8.3%) in the Electric Utilities industry.', ""That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by NextEra Energy, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.30. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

NEP\'s insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP\'s projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP\'s business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP\'s cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP\'s renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries\' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP\'s rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP\'s operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP\'s renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP\'s growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; reductions in demand for natural gas in the U.S. or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP\'s pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP\'s growth strategy; NEP\'s growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc.

And the truth is, the market is looking for more competition,” O’Donnell says.', ""In terms of semiconductors, O'Donnell points to announcements from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and how those companies will be looking to bring their chips to the masses. He also explains how tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are going to join the ring with Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM), pioneering the next generation of AI-processing software.For more episodes from our NEXT series, click here.

But that's so last year. So what's next in tech for 2024? Well, more AI of course."", ""Whether we're talking autonomous vehicles, smartphones, health care, gaming, cyber security, AI is the future. With that said, here are three ways artificial intelligence will evolve in the new year."", 'First, you can expect audio and video based generative AI applications to start to take off, rather than just text and image platforms we have now. Companies like 11 Labs are already on the case, offering audio based generative AI capabilities, and more firms will likely jump in throughout the year.', 'Companies will also be releasing generative AI models tailored to specific use cases. Those can include models that improve weather predicting, platforms for security products, and more. In addition to slick new capabilities, you can expect generative AI platforms to improve their accuracy.', ""Companies are already working to cut down on so-called hallucinations, or when bots present false statements as facts, and they're only going to get better in 2024. If you thought 2023 was the year of AI, 2024 will blow you away. And here to talk about what's next in tech and the future of AI is Bob O'Donnell, TECHnalysis Research President."", ""Bob, thank you so much for joining us. I guess, for the first question, just generally, for 2024, where does AI go from here? It's already been a massive explosion in 2023."", ""BOB O'DONNELL: Well, you're right, Dan. But here's the thing to remember, even though it had exploded onto the scene in 2023, and we got a lot of press and a lot of coverage and a lot of companies talking about it, the average person in the workplace, only a few of them have actually used it. So 2024, exactly to your point, is going to be the year when it really explodes because every day, people are going to use it."", ""Middle managers in small companies all over the world, all kinds of different people are going to start really be using generative AI in a meaningful way, and that impact is going to be enormous. Because of it-- so you're absolutely right, that's going to be the big deal for 2024, when we're at a high level, is that the rest of the world will sort of catch up to the tech industry and the tech press and really start using this. And it's just going to blow people away."", ""DAN HOWLEY: Well, Bob, in about a month's time, a little more than a month, the Consumer Electronics Show, CES, kicks off in Las Vegas. We're already hearing rumblings of what we might see. I guess, how will AI dominate the stage there in Vegas?"", ""BOB O'DONNELL: Well, everybody's going to talk about it, right. I mean, you know, it's almost become a joke now at tech conferences, if you don't mention generative AI like 10 times in the first two minutes. And so we're going to see everybody talk about."", ""How it plays out at CES is going to be interesting because in it-- I believe, we're going to see more of an impact initially in business than we are consumer. Certainly, there's going to be consumer. I'm going to talk about a couple of things related that in a second."", ""So we'll see a lot of noise. And we'll see people talking about devices that can do generative AI. And that's going to be important. And there are going to be devices like PCs that, I think, are going to be a big factor in 2024. And, of course, consumers and businesses will use them."", ""We'll see other gadgets. We'll see other types of services. There's going to be-- there's a lot of startups who are trying to make a splash in generative AI. You talked about audio and video applications, certainly, we're going to see that at CES. So I think that's going to be important."", 'But I think there are some other interesting long picture trends that we also need to think about for 2024.', ""DAN HOWLEY: I just want-- to your point about companies having to say something about generative AI, you just look to Apple where they didn't mention anything about generative AI. They kept kind of mum on that. Did a lot of machine learning talk but nothing generative AI related. And a lot of folks were thinking, when's Apple going to jump into this?"", ""But, you know, NVIDIA was the big company, in 2023, to dominate with their AI semiconductor technology. The graphics chips that power a lot of this was a gaming company, now they're still in gaming but headlong into AI. Where does that company go from here?"", ""BOB O'DONNELL: Well, I mean, NVIDIA is going to continue to ride this generative AI wave because over the years, what they ended up doing was building up this platform of software called CUDA. And CUDA is what all the developers for these generative AI tools are using. And they're very comfortable with it. And there's this broad base of tools. And that's the advantage that NVIDIA has had that's made it so difficult for other companies to compete with them."", ""Now, we are going to see big competition-- and this hints at to what I was hinting at earlier-- in 2024, we're going to see a ton of other semiconductor companies, obviously, be going after NVIDIA. And the truth is, the market is looking for more competition. It always does, right?"", ""So AMD, this week, has in event. Intel, next week, has an event. We're going to see-- and we just saw AWS announce some chips. We just saw Microsoft announce some chips. So what's really interesting is all the big, traditional semiconductor players are going to be out there talking about this. As well as companies you don't normally think of as chip companies, being Amazon and Microsoft and Google."", ""There's going to be a little bunch of little startups too. I think they're going to be challenged, to be honest with you. I think this is going to be a case of the big getting bigger."", ""Another big name is going to be Qualcomm, and this gets to the other theme I was talking about. 2024 is going to see the launch of AI-equipped PCs. PCs that actually can do some of the work that we've traditionally had to do in the cloud on the device."", ""And that's going to make things very interesting. And we're going to see a lot of competition amongst AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. We're going to see all the big PC players, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Apple as well, try and get in there and talk about this next generation of PCs."", ""And the timing is perfect because, remember that a lot of companies had to buy PCs during the very beginning of the pandemic. 2024, it's that four-year refresh time. So you put that together, I think that's going to be an interesting category to watch moving forward as well."", ""DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, and Google's already doing that with their latest Pixel phones. They have their own AI chips built in, and they're doing AI generative-- AI natively on the phones with camera applications. So it's really interesting there."", ""I guess, the last question that we have here is, looking to the future, there's been kind of this shake up at OpenAI. Are there going to be repercussions for that throughout the industry? Is it a moment that kind of shatters the AI build up explosion, or is it kind of going to be business as usual?"", ""BOB O'DONNELL: It's a fair question. I don't think it's going to be business as usual. And I think we are going to see some big changes happening. But in the same way that I think we're going to see some of the bigger semiconductors end up surviving more, I think the same thing is going to happen when it comes to the companies building these foundation models and doing a lot of the hard work behind the scenes."", ""It turns out-- initially, we were all told, oh, there's AI training-- there's model training and then there's what's called inference. And they seem to be somewhat equal. Well, in point of fact, it turns out building these models is unbelievably hard and unbelievably expensive. Which means only the biggest tech companies can afford to do this. And so I think you're going to see a big shift there."", 'The one difference is going to be the companies that the big guys have aligned with. So Microsoft, obviously with OpenAI, AWS just aligned with Anthropic. I think we can imagine other deals. Meta is going to be an important player as well.', ""Those big companies are going to continue to position themselves. And again, some of the smaller startups that are trying to build models, I think they're going to be challenged. There's going to be different ways of doing some of the work."", ""You talked about reducing hallucinations, there's interesting technologies being developed. Something called RAG, Retrieval Augmented Generation, that's a new way to think about how you build generative AI tools. All of those things are going to have a big impact on the market. It's going to be tough to predict exactly how it goes. But there's no question that we're going to see those of changes in 2024 for sure.""]"

Russia’s war in Ukraine has been ongoing for the last 650 days with scores dead and millions displaced. There are regular border skirmishes in the Caucasus between Azerbaijan and Armenia, with the former having seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenian control during the fall of 2020. Afghanistan’s collapse to the Taliban in 2021 has also created a security challenge for regional countries. Worst of all, the Middle East is up in flames after Israel invaded the Gaza strip following hundreds of Hamas fighters launching an attack on Israel last month.', 'Driven by security challenges, several nations of the world are increasing defense spending to equip their militaries with advanced, sophisticated weapons required to enhance their capabilities. Global defense spending reached a record high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), with Europe having its steepest rise in expenditure in 30 years. The United States, China, and Russia accounted for more than half of all military spending that year, while defense expenditure of NATO member countries rose 0.9% to total $1.2 trillion.', 'The uptick in defense expenditure has meant a boom for the global defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) posted revenues of a whopping $66 billion in 2022, and earned $5.7 billion in profits. The company is the largest defense contractor in the US and received 11% of all DoD military-related contracts last year.

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)’s sales were also significantly higher in 2022 compared to the previous year.', 'The United States continues to retain its aerial and naval superiority over both China and Russia because of its fleet of the fifth-generation fighter jets and advanced aircraft carriers, including a $13.3 billion warship. In 2005, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor enabled the United States to become the first country to have a fifth-generation fighter jet. Later in 2015, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) developed the F-35B Lightning II to give the US Air Force a further edge over its rivals in aerial space.', 'What separates fifth-generation fighter jets from the previous generation of jets is that these are equipped with modern technologies of the 21st century such as “stealth” and come equipped with features that make it hard for radars to detect them. Russia, with its Su-57, and China with J-20, have their own versions of fifth-generation stealth fighter jets but lag behind the Americans in both fleet size and capabilities.', 'On the naval side of things, the United States has the highest number of aircraft carriers. Currently, the US Navy is working with Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) on the development of nuclear-powered Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers that would replace the Nimitz class aircraft carrier design. The Navy plans on having at least four of these carriers.', 'The first of these, CVN-78, has already been delivered by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII). The carrier was first procured in 2008 for an estimated $13.3 billion. It was commissioned in 2017, and became operational in 2021. The scheduled delivery years for the remaining three carriers – CVN-79, CVN-80 and CVN-81 – are 2025, 2028 and 2032, respectively.', ""There is a key military frontier, however, in which Russia is ahead. That is hypersonic missiles. These missiles evade radars and travel at a speed of over 6,200 km per hour in the upper atmosphere, which is five times more than the speed of sound. The first type of hypersonic missile is the Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV), which has the ability to leave and plunge back into the Earth's atmosphere. The other, which is the Hypersonic Cruise Missile (HCM), is capable of carrying nuclear warheads and travels at a lightning speed at lower altitude. The exact count of the hypersonic missiles Russia possesses is not known. The Americans are currently pursuing development of these weapons. The U.S. Department of Defense set aside $3.2 billion in 2021 in R&D for hypersonic missiles, according to the DoD."", ""All being said, recent conflicts have demonstrated that just having a military that is large in size and units of inventory alone is not enough to gauge its strength. The professionalism, skill level and battle hardness of troops, and being in possession of advanced, sophisticated equipment instead of decades-old outdated technology are often ignored, but these are critical determinants of military power. Logistics, geographical reach, and space presence are other important factors in today's world. Nuclear deterrence is another key competitive edge that some nations hold over the others.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 States with the Highest Average Home Prices.', ""The US housing market continues to be a victim of a rigid affordability crisis. This is because prices keep on rising while the existing supply of houses cannot cater to the high demand. On October 20, CNN reported that the home sales hit a 13-year low in September. A large proportion of would-be buyers have been unable to attain a home due to soaring interest rates in addition to highly-priced houses. The monthly payment on an average-priced home requires 40% of the median household income. Some of the most overpriced housing markets in the US have also been previously covered. As median home prices continue to climb, Americans who were looking to buy a house are considering renting one instead. However, the rental market doesn't offer any bright prospects either. This is because new construction is concentrated in certain metro areas or it is high-end. Hence, affordable housing units still tend to be unavailable for many. Those residing in states such as Florida which have high costs of housing, have less income to spend on other requirements after paying for rent.\xa0"", 'The housing market’s return to normal seems to be challenging since it requires a significant drop in house prices and mortgage rates. While those who aspire to buy houses wait for the market to offer reasonably priced homes, existing homeowners are holding houses since they will have to pay a higher mortgage to acquire a new house.', 'Amid rising home prices, several home builders offer affordable housing to cater to the diverse needs of homebuyers. Some of these include Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH), and PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM).

The prices for these new homes start from the mid $300,000s. The three communities from Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) are also located close to schools and outdoor spaces."", 'KB Home (NYSE:KBH) is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. The firm builds quality homes that are customized as per the buyer’s preference and available budget. On December 1, KB Home (NYSE:KBH) reported the opening of its latest new home community in Flagler Beach, Florida. The residents of these new one-and-two-story homes can easily access local beaches located minutes away. Nearby shopping and dining options can also be availed. Pricing for these houses begins from the mid $300,000s.', 'PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) operates Pulte Homes which constructs consumer-inspired homes and communities in more than 40 markets across the US. On November 29, the company reported its return to the Salt Lake City market in Utah. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) is constructing two new communities in the region which are expected to open in early 2024. The new single-family homes and townhomes will be located in Jordanelle Ridge which offers convenient access to ski resorts, restaurants, golf courses, and state parks.

With the latest surge, the benchmark quickly erased its steep drop seen in the summer and has gained 20% so far this year. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen more than 21% so far this year.The gains were driven by optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes, which has pushed the Treasury yields down and rekindled investors’ risk-on trade. Yields on U.S. Treasuries saw the biggest monthly drop since 2008 (read: Treasury ETFs on Track for Best Month Since March).As the rally has been broad-based, we have highlighted five stocks from different industries that have doubled or near to double so far this year, and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). These are Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, PulteGroup Inc. PHM and Salesforce Inc. CRM.There\'s a growing confidence among investors that the Fed might be nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle. This optimism was further fueled by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank could cut rates starting in March. According to CME’s FedWatch tool, traders are pricing in a 70% chance for a rate cut by the U.S. central bank by next March. The latest round of data points has also strengthened the idea that the Fed is done with rate hikes.A significant portion of the S&P 500\'s gains can be attributed to the strong performance of a group of large-cap stocks, referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven."" This group, comprising Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla, has seen significant stock gains from 47% to 220% so far this year. The perceived safety of these investments, their size, competitive advantages, and the potential of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence have been the key factors driving their performances.Further, better-than-expected earnings added to the strength. Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index, which was negative for each of the preceding three quarters, turned positive in the third quarter of 2023 (read: Can S&P 500 Jump to 5000 in 2024?

This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $434.7 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year.

The stock of both companies tanked following the news as investors balked over the uncertainty of a deal review from increasingly aggressive antitrust regulators in the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice.', 'Analysts and industry experts agree a marriage between the two massive health insurers would face strict antitrust inspection. Already, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has called on regulators to “carefully scrutinize” a potential merger.', 'Gaining regulatory approval — especially if a challenge further ties up the process in the courts — could set a deal’s finalization back by a year or more. But, due to a lack of direct competition between the two, Cigna and Humana could be allowed to combine, creating a healthcare powerhouse with roughly $300 billion in annual revenue.', '“I think it’s probably going to get approved, if I were a betting person,” said Samantha Prokop, head of healthcare transactions at Florida law firm Gunster. “[Cigna and Humana] know what the regulatory scheme is, they know what they’re up against and they’re expecting to do it.”', 'The merger is a smart strategic play, experts said. It would build a large diversified managed care organization out of two companies with more narrow focuses today: Humana in Medicare Advantage and Cigna in employer-sponsored plans. Along with gaining significant scale in MA, Cigna’s pharmacy benefit manager could bring in Humana’s covered lives, increasing its purchasing power for drugs.', 'Experts noted that other major U.S. insurers like UnitedHealth, CVS and Elevance all have highly diversified businesses —much of them built through acquisitions — so there’s plenty of regulatory precedent to allow Cigna and Humana to merge.', '“The FTC is fairly hypocritical over its lifespan. It’s allowed [UnitedHealth] to get to what it is,” said Nathan Ray, healthcare M&A lead at consultancy West Monroe. “It’s created a whole new tier of payer size one could argue mergers like this are necessary to compete with.”', 'Historically, regulators have been most successful challenging deals with significant horizontal overlap, where a merger increases a company’s market share in its existing industry.', 'Concerns that health insurer consolidation would reduce consumer plan choice in select markets stopped a handful of proposed megamergers in the mid-2010s, including Aetna’s bid for Humana and Anthem’s bid for Cigna.', 'Both deals were blocked by the DOJ in 2017, setting a precedent that’s going to make regulators extremely skeptical of the Cigna-Humana deal, according to David Balto, an antitrust attorney and former policy director at the FTC.', '“This is going to be an incredibly hard deal to get through. There is nothing that strengthens the resolve of an enforcement agency as having litigated a case and having won,” Balto said.', 'Given the history, investors were wary when the WSJ reported on talks between Cigna and Humana, analysts said. Shares in Humana dropped almost 6% and shares in Cigna dropped more than 8% over Nov. 29, the day deal speculation broke.', 'Yet, there are few horizontal concerns when it comes to this proposed deal — especially if Cigna and Humana follow through on plans to shed overlapping assets.', 'Cigna is currently pursuing a sale of its MA business, according to Reuters reporting. Meanwhile, Humana announced in February it would be exiting its commercial group businesses over the following 18 to 24 months.', 'Those divestitures largely eliminate competitive overlap between Cigna and Humana’s managed care businesses, J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note on the deal speculation.', 'However, regulators are currently less open to divestitures as a solution to anticompetitive concerns than in the past, according to Balto.', '“They don’t believe those remedies work,” Balto said.', 'Even if the divestitures are greenlit and eliminate the brunt of horizontal concerns, the FTC could still analyze how a Cigna-Humana merger could impact plan choice in select markets, according to Gunster’s Prokop.', '""I don’t know how much more consolidation we can see and still see a fair market.""', 'Samantha Prokop', 'Gunster head of healthcare transactions', 'In addition, regulators could look at the vertical effects of the transaction, like whether it would result in downstream harm to healthcare providers by giving the combined insurer more leverage in price negotiations. They could also consider how the merger would affect providers in markets where Cigna and Humana operate their own physician networks, and if it could result in more patients being steered away from independent providers.', 'Regulators might scrutinize senior care more heavily, given Humana owns a major senior-focused primary care network with hundreds of centers across 12 states, Prokop said.', '“It’s one less contract for the doctors,” said Prokop. “It’s concerning you have four major payers and now you’re going down to three. I don’t know how much more consolidation we can see and still see a fair market.”', 'Federal antitrust agencies proposed updates to merger guidelines earlier this year that could make it easier for them to successfully argue more esoteric theories of harm, like a deal’s detrimental vertical effects, in court. If finalized, the guidelines are expected to give regulators more leverage to block mergers.', 'If regulators do decide to challenge a Cigna-Humana deal, perhaps the most successful strategy would be to focus on overlap between the companies’ pharmacy benefit management businesses, experts say.', 'That’s because a union between the two would create a PBM titan in a market that’s already highly consolidated.', 'PBMs are the much-maligned middlemen in the drug supply chain between health insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cigna owns the second-largest PBM in the U.S., while Humana owns the fourth largest, according to pharmaceutical industry research firm Drug Channels Institute.', '“The PBM overlap could be more problematic, depending on how the DOJ determines competition,” Bank of America analyst Kevin Fischbeck wrote in a note on the deal.', 'Combining Cigna and Humana’s PBMs would create a company large enough to rival market leader CVS Caremark, which could create vertical harm for drug companies or distributors, analysts said.', 'PBM market share by total equivalent prescription claims managed, 2022', '“Given the extraordinary regulatory scrutiny of PBMs ... this aspect of the deal seems certain to be challenged,” TD Cowen analyst Gary Taylor wrote in a note on the merger speculation. PBMs already face a notable amount of anticompetitive scrutiny, including an investigation from the FTC.', 'Humana’s PBM is relatively small and primarily serves its own managed care members, noted JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill.', 'Yet “we see a high likelihood regulators could challenge the deal anyway,” Gill wrote in a note on the deal.', 'Experts estimate a Cigna-Humana merger could take from one to two years to close from when it’s announced, depending on what angle antitrust agencies take in reviewing the deal.', 'If regulators are just worried about horizontal consolidation in the managed care sector, and Cigna sells its MA business, the deal could be finalized in a matter of months, Prokop said.', 'Yet, “I think it is highly likely that the FTC either probes or challenges some aspect of the merger. [FTC Chair] Lina Khan has demonstrated a more hawkish attitude towards corporate consolidation, particularly in healthcare,” said George Congdon, senior analyst at research firm Third Bridge.', 'President Joe Biden has called on antitrust regulators to vigorously enforce antitrust laws in the healthcare sector, as prices continue to rise for Americans. However, regulators have a spotty record of challenging recent deals.', 'Insurers have been allowed to balloon in size to some of the biggest companies in the country, despite a tremendous amount of regulatory scrutiny, experts said.', 'In 2018, CVS bought health insurer Aetna for $78 billion, while Cigna bought its PBM Express Scripts for $67 billion. Health insurer Centene purchased WellCare for $17 billion in 2020. All three megamergers closed without a challenge, though Centene was required to divest select businesses.', 'Payers have also continued snapping up physician practices, including CVS’ buy of Oak Street Health this year for almost $11 billion, or UnitedHealth’s series of deals that’s helped grow its doctor network to 90,000 owned or affiliated physicians. That’s one-tenth of all doctors in the nation.', 'UnitedHealth also muscled through a $13 billion acquisition of data analytics company Change Healthcare last year, despite the DOJ suing to stop the deal.', 'Regulators have a low batting average in challenging deals without direct competitive overlap, experts said. A merger between Cigna and Humana could be more of the same: careful antitrust scrutiny, perhaps a direct challenge, but eventually the payers combine.', 'But “the agencies have really changed — they take a broader view,” Balto said. “The typical arguments of health insurers that we need the merger to strengthen our power to reduce provider costs — that’s going to fall on deaf ears.”', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

You can skip our detailed analysis on countries racking up their defense capabilities and its impact on the armaments manufacturing industry by directly heading over to our list of the 10 Most Powerful Countries In The World By Military.', 'The last three years have been marred by conflict, with no end in sight. Russia’s war in Ukraine has been ongoing for the last 650 days with scores dead and millions displaced. There are regular border skirmishes in the Caucasus between Azerbaijan and Armenia, with the former having seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenian control during the fall of 2020. Afghanistan’s collapse to the Taliban in 2021 has also created a security challenge for regional countries. Worst of all, the Middle East is up in flames after Israel invaded the Gaza strip following hundreds of Hamas fighters launching an attack on Israel last month.', 'Driven by security challenges, several nations of the world are increasing defense spending to equip their militaries with advanced, sophisticated weapons required to enhance their capabilities. Global defense spending reached a record high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), with Europe having its steepest rise in expenditure in 30 years. The United States, China, and Russia accounted for more than half of all military spending that year, while defense expenditure of NATO member countries rose 0.9% to total $1.2 trillion.', 'The uptick in defense expenditure has meant a boom for the global defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) posted revenues of a whopping $66 billion in 2022, and earned $5.7 billion in profits. The company is the largest defense contractor in the US and received 11% of all DoD military-related contracts last year. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) also reported an 8.9% increase in its net earnings compared to 2021. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)’s sales were also significantly higher in 2022 compared to the previous year.', 'The United States continues to retain its aerial and naval superiority over both China and Russia because of its fleet of the fifth-generation fighter jets and advanced aircraft carriers, including a $13.3 billion warship. In 2005, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor enabled the United States to become the first country to have a fifth-generation fighter jet. Later in 2015, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) developed the F-35B Lightning II to give the US Air Force a further edge over its rivals in aerial space.', 'What separates fifth-generation fighter jets from the previous generation of jets is that these are equipped with modern technologies of the 21st century such as “stealth” and come equipped with features that make it hard for radars to detect them. Russia, with its Su-57, and China with J-20, have their own versions of fifth-generation stealth fighter jets but lag behind the Americans in both fleet size and capabilities.', 'On the naval side of things, the United States has the highest number of aircraft carriers. Currently, the US Navy is working with Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) on the development of nuclear-powered Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers that would replace the Nimitz class aircraft carrier design. The Navy plans on having at least four of these carriers.', 'The first of these, CVN-78, has already been delivered by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII). The carrier was first procured in 2008 for an estimated $13.3 billion. It was commissioned in 2017, and became operational in 2021. The scheduled delivery years for the remaining three carriers – CVN-79, CVN-80 and CVN-81 – are 2025, 2028 and 2032, respectively.', ""There is a key military frontier, however, in which Russia is ahead. That is hypersonic missiles. These missiles evade radars and travel at a speed of over 6,200 km per hour in the upper atmosphere, which is five times more than the speed of sound. The first type of hypersonic missile is the Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV), which has the ability to leave and plunge back into the Earth's atmosphere. The other, which is the Hypersonic Cruise Missile (HCM), is capable of carrying nuclear warheads and travels at a lightning speed at lower altitude. The exact count of the hypersonic missiles Russia possesses is not known. The Americans are currently pursuing development of these weapons. The U.S. Department of Defense set aside $3.2 billion in 2021 in R&D for hypersonic missiles, according to the DoD."", ""All being said, recent conflicts have demonstrated that just having a military that is large in size and units of inventory alone is not enough to gauge its strength. The professionalism, skill level and battle hardness of troops, and being in possession of advanced, sophisticated equipment instead of decades-old outdated technology are often ignored, but these are critical determinants of military power. Logistics, geographical reach, and space presence are other important factors in today's world. Nuclear deterrence is another key competitive edge that some nations hold over the others. Therefore, all of these factors must be weighed in when determining military strength."", 'Photo by Joel Rivera-Camacho on Unsplash', 'We have considered ten weighted metrics to rank the most powerful countries in the world by military. These metrics and their weights are as follows: GDP 5%, defense spending 10%, tanks 10%, manpower 10%, nuclear weapons 15%, military aircraft including fighter jets 15%, naval assets 15%, technological capabilities 5%, military satellites 5%, active airfields 5%, and overseas military bases 5%.', ""We referred to 50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023 for data on GDP, while SIPRI's 2023 report was used for figures related to military spending by countries in 2022. Information related to manpower, tanks, and military satellites was pulled from our recent articles, 25 Strongest Armies in the World in 2023 and 15 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Satellites in Orbit. For number of nuclear weapons, military satellites and overseas military bases, our source was The Power Atlas. Global Innovation Index 2022 was used to gauge technological capabilities of each of these countries. Information related to fighter jets and naval assets were taken from Global Firepower Index 2023 and Flight International 2022."", 'Weighted scores for each metric were then aggregated to get an overall score.

That same month, Wells Fargo canceled a $15 million bonus it had given to Sloan — an action the ex-CEO’s lawyers, in Friday’s lawsuit, called “a public show.”', 'Sloan opted not to negotiate a severance agreement “in a spirit of mutual trust,” the lawyers wrote, according to the Financial Times, adding that Wells Fargo “reneged” on verbal promises to pay out his long-term grants.', 'Sloan “bore the brunt of public criticism, much of it directed at Wells Fargo policies and practices that predated his tenure as COO or CEO and which he was working assiduously to correct,” the lawyers wrote, according to the Financial Times.', 'The bank hired Charlie Scharf, then CEO of BNY Mellon, to succeed Sloan in 2019.

At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 29% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 17% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Pfizer the TSR over the last 1 year was -40%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.

Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

He also said IBM has committed approximately $100 million to universities to support AI research projects over the next five years, and that the computing titan has worked with Meta to build out an open-source toolkit for AI development.', 'As for governance, Gil said that the alliance is still working out the details.

The major industrial average appears to have begun a new leg higher and is now less than 2% away from an all-time high! The S&P 500 also notched a new closing high for the year on Friday.', 'While we fully expect the Dow to ultimately surpass that level as other industries play catch-up to tech, we need to be realistic about future returns in the short-term. There’s a very small chance that December will pan out like November did. Simply put, markets rallied strongly off of oversold levels after entering a correction in October.', 'The widely-followed volatility (VIX) index also hit a low for the year last week, but is surging this morning in conjunction with a slight selloff in stocks. Low-volatility periods are a hallmark of bull markets; still, periods of low volatility are inevitably followed by periods of high volatility. Insurance in the form of put options is cheap here, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see some near-term weakness which would likely coincide with a temporary rise in the VIX.', 'Let’s remember, however, that the month of December tends to be bullish; in pre-election years, the S&P 500 has been positive more than 72% of the time since 1950 with an average return of 2.9%. The historical stats point to a high probability, but let’s keep in mind that the latter half of December tends to bring the majority of those gains.', 'From a longer-term perspective, the outsized monthly returns from November bode well for a continuation of this new bull market. In previous instances where the S&P 500 achieved a greater than 8% return in a single month (30 times dating back to 1950), a year later the index was higher 27/30 times with an average return of 15.8%. Those are compelling odds to say the least.', 'The market’s breadth expansion is bullish and points to a higher probability that we will ultimately eclipse the all-time highs for the major indexes. As long as inflation continues to decelerate, new highs appear likely early next year. The S&P 500 is only about 5% away from that mark; the previous 14 times the index went at least a full year without a new high and then finally made one, a year later it was higher 13/14 times and up nearly 15% on average.', 'Fed to Hold Steady Next Week', 'Officials are beginning to come around to the idea that we are at the end of this hiking cycle. Fed Governor Christopher Waller signaled he has become more confident that rates are at the right levels, reinforcing the notion that the Fed is finished with its interest rate hikes.', 'The best monthly performance in November for stocks since 2022 arrived in conjunction with a 2-year low in the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, prompting calls for interest rate cuts. October’s core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes food and energy components, met estimates last week with a 0.2% monthly rise and a 3.5% year-over-year increase. The outcome cements expectations that we are at an inflection point in terms of monetary policy; markets are currently pricing in 2 cuts in the first half of next year and 2 more in the second half.', 'Next week brings the final FOMC meeting of the year, with another rate pause all but assured. Fed Chief Jerome Powell stated that it’s “premature” to discuss rate cuts. The fact is that the economy has shown it can weather a higher interest rate environment. What the Fed wants to avoid is an inflation resurgence, similar to what happened in the ‘70s.', 'While most individual stocks were trading lower Monday morning along with the general market, a select few were bucking the trend. Cruise company Royal Caribbean Cruises spiked 3% to a 52-week high on an acceleration in booking volumes. Royal Caribbean intends to focus on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offerings. RCL stock has risen more than 130% this year and is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).', 'Audio and podcast streaming giantSpotify gapped up nearly 9% after announcing layoffs of another 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees. The workforce reduction was the third of the year. Spotify turned a surprise profit during the third quarter amid strong subscriber growth. A Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, SPOT has surged nearly 150% this year.', 'Crypto stocks are benefitting from a Bitcoin resurgence. The price of Bitcoin eclipsed $40,000 this morning, sending related stocks higher. Shares of Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, rose nearly 7% in the early going. Coinbase has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions lately, garnering a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). COIN stock has soared more than 300% in 2023.', 'The first half of December tends to be mediocre, with most of the Christmas-themed gains coming in the latter half of the month. From a longer-term and historical perspective, forward returns are enticing following stronger months like we saw in November.', 'Recent strength in sectors like financials, industrials, and health care bodes well for a continuation of this new bull market.

Some markets, however, have not seen the same success, like mountain resort company Vail Resorts (MTN) which is down more than 10% since last year. Paul Golding, Macquarie Capital Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into how different businesses in leisure travel have been able to succeed during times of inflation and why certain ones have struggled."", 'Golding expounds on why cruises did so well: ""Cruise has been benefiting, in our view, from some of these dynamics on later international re-flation and the value proposition that cruise represents versus land-based alternatives. We heard during the Q3 earnings call at RCL [Royal Caribbean Cruises] that they continue to see a 35-40% discount versus land-based, whereas pre-COVID that discount was about 10-15%. ""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- 2023 has been a strong year for leisure spending as Americans continue to splurge on experiences. Cruise lines like Carnival, they've enjoyed roaring post-pandemic demand with folks eager to set sail. The stock up 58%, almost 60% now here as we're taking a look at that year over year over the past 52 weeks, and demand is showing no signs of slowing down. Several Carnival brands saw record bookings over Black Friday as folks prepare for 2024 and 2025 travel even."", ""But Vail Resorts hasn't seen the same upward momentum. Even as the upcoming ski season saw an increase in bookings, headwinds from weather still weighing on the company's bottom line. We're joined now by Paul Golding who is the senior US lifestyle payments analyst over at Macquarie Capital. Great to have you here with us. First and foremost, Paul, when you kind evaluate these two different parts of the experience economy, where is their kind of continued strength that we should expect, and where is the consumer perhaps wavering on the ability to spend into some experiences?"", ""PAUL GOLDING: Yeah, great to be with you both. I think when we look at what's been happening across cruise versus ski, for example, we didn't have the inbound testing requirement for COVID come off in the US until August of last year. So there's some late tail international reflation that we've been seeing throughout this year. And of course, the majority of the EBITDA generation for Vail is North America resorts."", ""And so as we look at cruise, cruise has been benefiting in our view from some of these dynamics on late international reflation and the value proposition that cruise represents versus land-based alternatives. We heard during the '23 earnings call at RCL that they continue to see a 35% to 40% discount versus land-based. Whereas pre-COVID, that discount was about 10% to 15%."", ""So as we look at that business, we see an opportunity for cruise to continue to drive price and attract demand versus Vail, which we're neutral on and have been neutral on, which tends to be a more premium product, and is domestic, and also has other structural things going on like weather volatility. So for example, most recently, we took our target price down $10 from 235 to 225 on the back of a Lake Tahoe start and weather volatility over the Australian winter. So a lot of different dynamics here. Some demand-driven, some supply-driven, and that drives this dichotomy in our outlook.""]"

With the latest surge, the benchmark quickly erased its steep drop seen in the summer and has gained 20% so far this year. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen more than 21% so far this year.The gains were driven by optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes, which has pushed the Treasury yields down and rekindled investors’ risk-on trade. Yields on U.S. Treasuries saw the biggest monthly drop since 2008 (read: Treasury ETFs on Track for Best Month Since March).As the rally has been broad-based, we have highlighted five stocks from different industries that have doubled or near to double so far this year, and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). These are Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, PulteGroup Inc. PHM and Salesforce Inc. CRM.There\'s a growing confidence among investors that the Fed might be nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle. This optimism was further fueled by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank could cut rates starting in March. According to CME’s FedWatch tool, traders are pricing in a 70% chance for a rate cut by the U.S. central bank by next March. The latest round of data points has also strengthened the idea that the Fed is done with rate hikes.A significant portion of the S&P 500\'s gains can be attributed to the strong performance of a group of large-cap stocks, referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven."" This group, comprising Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla, has seen significant stock gains from 47% to 220% so far this year. The perceived safety of these investments, their size, competitive advantages, and the potential of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence have been the key factors driving their performances.Further, better-than-expected earnings added to the strength. Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index, which was negative for each of the preceding three quarters, turned positive in the third quarter of 2023 (read: Can S&P 500 Jump to 5000 in 2024?

Global Investment Solutions Head Brian Sanborn cautions against investors trying to ""neglect the long-term drivers of stock returns,"" just because of recent volatility.', ""Sanborn tells Yahoo Finance that by analyzing five vital areas - cash flow multiples, operating cash efficiency, accrual ratios, earnings alignments and price momentum - NDR's model is able to tap enduring performance through varied conditions. Sanborn notes that diverse sectors are represented, from tech to energy, and that companies that did make the list have remained cash-flow generating, even through crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '- As we near the end of the year, what should you be investing in for long term gains? Using things like free cash flow, price momentum, and shareholder yield, Ned Davis Research calculated the top stocks set up for long term returns with companies like Apple, Alphabet, and Exxon coming out on top. Brian Sanborn, Ned Davis Research Global Head Investment Solutions, joins us now. All right, so walk us through some of the findings here and why these particular companies really jumped out.', 'BRIAN SANBORN: All right. So as we were getting questions about next year, the election year uncertainty as well as how to position for a potential Fed rate cut or recession versus soft landing, we wanted to remind our clients not to neglect the long term drivers of stock returns. So we looked at 200 different metrics over the last 40 years, including macroeconomic sensitivities, fundamentals, technicals, and sentiment, and we looked at the return streams each of those characteristics over time.', ""And what we found was that there were five core drivers of stock returns. Free cash flow to enterprise value has been the most powerful driver of stock returns over the long term. It is a measure of valuation. Operating cash flow to assets is a measure of asset efficiency. Looking at accruals ratios. It's a measure of earnings quality. Looking at the difference between earnings and cash flows. Looking at a measure of payout, shareholder yield, which combines dividend yield, net debt reduction yield, and net repurchase yield. And lastly, looking at the price action, price momentum. In particular, we look at the one year rate of change in a stock's price and taking out the last month because the last month tends to be more reverting."", ""- So Brian, we mentioned the fact there in that intro, some of the favored stocks that include some of the larger well-known names like Apple, Alphabet, ExxonMobil. But what are some of the other additions that fall into the criteria that you just laid out that you're adding to your portfolio now?"", 'BRIAN SANBORN: Right. And so in terms of the sector distribution here, there is quite a nice representation of different sectors from energy, materials, industrials, communication services, the tech sector, as well as consumer discretionary. In fact, consumer discretionary and information technology are the two most represented sectors in this particular list.', 'The types of names, as you mentioned, are some of those mega-cap names. Your Apples, Alphabets, ExxonMobil. But also names like TJX Company, Booking Holdings, Marathon Petroleum, as well as Parker-Hannifin also came out in this particular list.', ""- And so within this list, how much of it is kind of continuing to evaluate some of the economic inputs? I mean, we were just having a conversation about whether or not we're going to see a soft landing or whether that would translate into or potentially see a mild recession. How much of that kind of changes where these top companies are coming out?"", 'BRIAN SANBORN: In terms of the characteristics themselves, and this analysis was done over the last 40 years, so it includes the global financial crisis, the COVID shutdown. And so these metrics have held up over during those periods of time. And so ultimately what the story is those companies that can efficiently generate cash flow, whose earnings reflect those cash flows, properly reward their equity shareholders through those cash flows, as well as the market recognizing that too while not being overvalued.', ""And so in these particular companies, they have consistently generated those cash flows over time. And so that's why they're appearing in this existing list. However, if we do go into recession, there are additional factors you can bolt on to these concepts, such as earnings stability, looking at the earnings volatility over time, as well as looking at metrics like dividend yield itself. Higher dividend yield companies tend to outperform during recessions."", ""- Brian, is that something that you're starting to do now given the fact that we have seen more and more strategists it seems like coming out, warning that we could or maybe it's time investors do start bracing for some sort of recession in the first half of the year?"", ""BRIAN SANBORN: We're not there yet. So Ned Davis himself put out a publication on Friday evaluating the economic indicators. Right now, we're just not seeing enough to indicate that a recession is imminent. The economic data are slowing. But NDR's US recession probability model is currently showing less than 20% odds that a recession is imminent.""]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term."", ""Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +7.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +8.6% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 7.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share, indicating a change of -9.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.70 points to a change of -9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.63 indicates a change of -1.5% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $34.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.5%. The $133.56 billion and $135.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.4% and +1.8%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Verizon reported revenues of $33.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.22 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.', 'Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.39 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.16%. The EPS surprise was +4.27%.', 'Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

The California-based chipmaking giant has seen its shares soar about 220% this year, making it the top performing S&P 500 stock in 2023.', 'But will next year bear the same fruit for the sixth most valuable company in the world?', 'What’s happening: Just before Thanksgiving, Nvidia crushed doubts that its star was fading by reporting gangbuster third quarter earnings.', 'Revenue was up 34% from the prior quarter and 206% from a year ago. The company also upped its guidance, meaning it expects the good times to keep on rolling. The AI firm forecast that its revenue for the final quarter of the year would come in at about $20 billion — analysts had projected about $17.8 billion.', 'Still, there’s a feeling on Wall Street that the reign of Nvidia can’t last forever and that cracks in the company’s facade are beginning to show.', 'Troubling signs ahead? One troubling sign for Nvidia is that the company’s own executives appear to be cashing out. Executives and top brass at the company sold or said they intend to sell a collective 370,000 shares of the stock in November, according to data from the Washington Service, a data and analytics company.', 'All in all that’s worth about $180 million.', 'If all the shares that were registered for sale during November are ultimately sold, the insider aggregate selling would be the largest at Nvidia in a month since December 2021. By value, if completely fulfilled, November 2023 would have the highest monthly value of stocks sold in the history of the company by insiders, according to Hannah de Wolf, business and product development lead at the Washington Service.', 'No executive or director purchased shares of the company’s stock over that same period.', 'New restrictions on chip exports to China have also tempered some enthusiasm for the company and could weigh down future profit.', '“The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a press call last month.', 'There’s also a question of momentum. Can a company with a $1.2 trillion market cap continue to grow at an exponential rate?', '“We’ve all heard the advice to under-promise and over-deliver, but it can start to work against you if people come to routinely expect that sort of thing,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “It’s something we’ve become accustomed to with NVDA.”', 'AI goldrush: But Nvidia has been staying relevant by cashing in on the AI craze, much like they did with crypto when that was the trend du jour.', '“It is quite reasonable to think of NVDA as selling picks and shovels, first to the cryptocurrency gold rush, now to the AI gold rush,” wrote Sosnick in a recent note.', 'By Sosnick’s count, Nvidia executives mentioned AI at least 70 times on their most recent earnings call. The term was brought up 37 times even before the first question was asked, he said.', 'Leaning into AI could extend Nvidia’s success into the new year as Wall Street continues to bet on monetizing artificial intelligence in the hopes of another 1990s-esque tech revolution.', '“We view AI as the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995 and believe many on the Street are still underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spend set to happen over the next decade in a bonanza for the chip and software sectors looking forward with Nvidia … leading the way,” wrote Dan Ives of Wedbush in a recent note.', 'Goldman Sachs analysts recently gave Nvidia a 34% upside over the next 12 months with a price target of $625 per share (it’s currently trading at about $452). Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar believes that the company is still trading at a discount compared with its valuation and that it’s not done with its upward trajectory.', 'Not everyone agrees. “Nvidia is a great company, but it needs to grow 30% per year for it to sustain its valuation,” Sarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner, said on CNBC last week. In order for that to happen, he said, “people are going to have to pay the same prices at the same margins and demand is going to increase and no competition is going to come in.”', 'While Sethi thinks it’s a fine stock to own, he cautioned that investors shouldn’t devote too large a percentage of their portfolio to it. “It’s a very volatile stock,” he said.', 'Historically, Nvidia has had hard falls after missteps — between 2021 and 2022, shares of the stock fell by 66%. “You need to be prepared,” said Sethi.', 'Bets against the value of Israeli companies spiked in the days before the October 7th Hamas attacks, suggesting some traders may have had advance knowledge of the looming terror attack and profited off it, according to new research released Monday.', 'The preliminary research, which hasn’t been peer reviewed, is from law professors at Columbia University and New York University and details a “significant” and “unusual” spike five days before the attacks in short selling in the most popular fund linked to Israeli companies, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Short selling is a way to bet against the value of a security.', 'Those bets against the value of the MSCI Israel Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the days before the October 7 attack “far exceeded” the short selling activity that took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and the 2008 global financial crisis, the paper finds.', '“Our findings suggest that traders informed about the coming attacks profited from these tragic events,” the authors wrote.', 'The paper, titled “Trading on Terror?”, was written by former SEC commissioner Robert Jackson Jr., who is currently a professor at NYU, and Columbia law professor Joshua Mitts.', 'The research found that on October 2, just five days before the Hamas attack, “nearly 100% of the off-exchange trading volume in the MSCI Israel ETF … consisted of short selling.”', '“Days before the attack, traders appeared to anticipate the events to come,” the professors wrote.', 'Mitts, one of the paper’s authors, told CNN in a phone interview that due to the limited nature of public trading data, he believes it’s “highly likely” there is more trading that went on behind the scenes. “We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” Mitts said. “There is a lot more out there that we can’t pick up on but that regulators should be looking at.”', 'Mitts added that he and Jackson, his co-author, are “very confident” that the trading activity is “exceptional” and “extraordinary” when compared with over a decade of trading and “not the product of ordinary trading.”', 'The authors at present don’t know the location of parties making trades and whether the traders were connected to any particular financial firms, government entities or terrorist organizations.

The move is all part of a retaliatory package of tariffs being imposed on US goods by the EU in relation to a dispute over steel and aluminum.', 'On Tuesday, a group of bipartisan lawmakers, led by democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, sent a letter to the Biden administration, urging officials to resolve the dispute with the EU by the end of the year and avoid what insiders are saying will be “dramatic” damage to the industry.', '“The American spirits industry supports over 19,000 jobs in Nevada and funnels billions into our economy each year,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “I’m urging the administration to act now to eliminate these devastating tariffs on American exports and stand up for American workers.”', 'The letter, shared exclusively with CNN, was signed by 12 US Senators also including Indiana republican Todd Young, Virginia democrats Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, Kentucky republican Rand Paul, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Tennessee republicans Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn, West Virginia democrat Joe Manchin, Kansas republican Roger Marshall, and Alaska republican Katie Britt.', '“Spirits have had a significant cultural impact in our country, and currently have a profound impact on the US economy.

The media industries reached an inflection point in 2022, with revenue growth slowing to\xa05.4% from 10.6% in 2021. This trend is expected to continue, with revenue growth declining sequentially each year for the next five years. By 2027, revenue growth is projected to be just 2.8%, slower than the overall economic growth rate of 3.1% forecast by the IMF. This slowdown is attributed to several factors, including increased competition from new entrants, changes in consumer behavior, and economic uncertainty and inflation.

While the impact varied across different sectors, the industry faced challenges due to the pandemic's restrictions and shifting consumer behaviors. Conversely, the demand for over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services and data consumption surged as people turned to digital platforms for entertainment during the pandemic. This trend fueled growth in film and television delivered via the Internet. Given this, Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) revenues are expected to surge, reaching twice the size of the box office by 2024.

To skip the details of Mr. Cooperman’s life and investment strategy, go directly to Billionaire Lee Cooperman's 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential."", 'Leon Cooperman is the true definition of a “self-made” person. He was born in the South Bronx to a couple of Polish immigrants, and his father worked as a plumber. Today, Leon Cooperman is one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth of $2.8 billion. Cooperman is an investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. His life story has recently been released in the form of a memoir, From The Bronx To Wall Street: My Fifty Years in Finance and Philanthropy.', 'Leon Cooperman became the first man in his family to graduate college as he received his undergraduate degree from Hunter College and went on to receive his MBA from Columbia Business School in 1967. He joined Goldman Sachs shortly after his MBA, and by 1989, he was the chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.', 'Mr. Cooperman established Omega Advisors in 1991 and managed it till 2018 before converting it into a family office. Between 1991 and 2018, Omega had average annualized returns of 12.5%. Leon Cooperman is a value investing legend along with the likes of Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman. The most basic definition of value investing is that it is an investment strategy that involves picking undervalued stocks that are expected to grow steadily over a long period of time. A value investor invests in stocks that they think are underappreciated and believe them to be trading below their intrinsic or book value.', 'While a few other hedge fund billionaires, such as Ken Fisher, have a positive outlook on the economy, Leon Cooperman doesn’t share the same sentiment. In an October interview with CNBC, he said:', '“I think if you recall about a year ago on your program in the morning, I said that I felt like the Pharaoh. And the Pharaoh had a dream. A dream was interpreted by Joseph. And that dream was in the Bible and he said he would expect his seven lean years following seven fat years. So I’m of the view that we borrow from the future with very profligate fiscal policy. We’re running up debt in this country, which is borrowed from the future and have a very conservative view. You know, and, you know, in 2020, national debt was $20 trillion. And I say in 2017, it was 20 trillion, and currently running around 33 trillion. That’s a growth rate – for the economy. And either it doesn’t matter or it matters. I think it matters and ultimately, we will have a crisis in public sector finance, and the market is not discounting a crisis. But you know, overall, I expect very little from the market.”', 'When asked about advice on investing in the current economic environment, he said that he prefers cheap stocks followed by short and dated treasuries in a one to two-year period. Leon Cooperman’s least favorite investments at the moment are long-term bonds, as he thinks that they don’t make sense in the current global conditions.', 'In the third quarter, Cooperman’s 13F portfolio had investments in all sectors of the market. However, a major part of his portfolio consists of healthcare, industrials, and communication services stocks. Leon Cooperman’s 13F portfolio was valued at over $1.9 billion in Q3, up from $1.84 billion in the previous quarter. He initiated new positions at Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU) and Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) and sold out of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) and Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE:CIM).

Solid momentum in the Commercial and Consumer Security business was offset by softness in the Solar segment due to operational challenges from changing panel suppliers and weaker sales. Management quickly took action by announcing the implementation of a new dealer program and investments in infrastructure to improve cycle time. While the risk /reward remains compelling, we think patience will be required as ADT works to turnaround the solar business.

Shares of the quick service restaurant giant have returned 276% in the last 10 years and a whopping 1,770% since November 2003, after adjusting for dividends. Valued at $207 billion, MCD stock trades just 5% below its all-time high and offers a dividend yield of 2.3%. I remain bullish on McDonald’s stock due to its strong brand presence, diversified revenue streams (which continue to diversify further), and reasonable valuation.', 'Among the most recognizable brands in the world, McDonald’s began as a small drive-in restaurant in California and has grown into an American heavyweight that serves 63 million customers every single day. It owns and operates restaurants and franchises in the U.S. and several international markets. The company ended Q3 with 41,198 locations in more than 100 countries, but it owns and operates around 5% of these restaurants, while 95% are operated by franchises.', 'However, investors should understand that McDonald’s owns a majority of its locations, which are leased out to franchisors. In fact, its property value on the balance sheet is over $42 billion, and the company earned $7.3 billion in rental revenue in the first nine months of 2023. This suggests that more than 60% of franchise-based sales are derived from rental income, which is quite exceptional. The rest is generated via annual franchise fees.', 'Additionally, rental sales account for close to 40% of McDonald’s revenue, providing it with a steady stream of cash flows across business cycles.', 'McDonald’s predictable cash flows allow it to pay shareholders an annualized dividend of $6.68 per share. Moreover, as its rental income has increased over the years, its dividend payouts have risen by 14.8% annually since 1994, showcasing the resiliency of this business model.', 'With a payout ratio of 52.5%, McDonald’s has enough flexibility to raise dividends, deleverage its balance sheet, and invest in growth projects that will drive future cash flows higher.', 'Despite a sluggish macro environment, McDonald’s increased sales by 11% year-over-year to $19.1 billion in the last three quarters. Its top-line growth, coupled with a lower cost base, has allowed it to increase its net income by a stellar 50% year-over-year in the first nine months of 2023.', 'McDonald’s is fairly recession-resistant and might actually thrive during periods of sluggish consumer spending. Typically, consumers trade down from full-service dining and casual dining during recessions in the hunt for cheaper meal options, acting as a tailwind for McDonald’s and other quick-service restaurants.', 'A weak economy favors McDonald’s and its peers, as witnessed by an 8.1% increase in same-store sales in the U.S. in Q3 2023.', 'Unlike several other restaurant companies, McDonald’s unique business model allows it to benefit from sky-high profit margins. For instance, its operating margins surged to 46% in Q3 compared to a margin of 16.4% reported by Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).', 'Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG) and CITIC, two investment firms, have a strategic partnership with McDonald’s that operates and manages the latter’s business in mainland China, Macau, and Hong Kong. Last month, McDonald’s agreed to acquire Carlyle’s minority stake in this partnership.', 'The CITIC Consortium will maintain its controlling stake in this venture, which stands at 52%. Further, McDonald’s will remain a minority partner but will increase its stake to 48% from 20%.', 'McDonald’s partnership with CITIC and Carlyle has been quite fruitful in growing the company’s brand in China, which is also its second-largest market. Since 2017, McDonald’s has doubled its restaurant count in this region to over 5,500.', 'McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski stated, “We believe there is no better time to simplify our structure, given the tremendous opportunity to capture increased demand and further benefit from our fastest growing market’s long-term potential.”', 'The business has generated systemwide sales growth of over 30% in China since September 2019. CITIC remains optimistic about growing the McDonald’s brand organically in China and expects to end 2028 with more than 10,000 restaurants.', 'McDonald’s is forecast to increase sales by 0.4% year-over-year to $23.3 billion, while adjusted earnings are expected to grow by 16.9% to $11.81 per share for 2023. So, MCD stock is priced at 8.9x forward sales and 24.2x forward earnings, which is not too expensive, given its high-quality business.', 'Out of the 27 analysts covering McDonald’s stock, 22 recommend a Buy, five recommend a Hold, and none recommend a Sell. The average MCD stock price target\xa0is $311.58, which is 10.6% above the current trading price.', 'McDonald’s has survived multiple economic downturns over several decades and is likely to emerge unscathed from the ongoing macro uncertainty. I believe that its high profit margins, stable earnings, pricing power, and widening base of franchise fees make it a top investment choice today.', 'Disclosure']"

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.', 'Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.', 'Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.', 'One company value investors might notice is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.', ""PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.22.

Over the past 12 months, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.11 and as low as 2.58, with a median of 2.86."", ""Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.43. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.5."", ""Finally, our model also underscores that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.67.

Nevertheless, stuff happens – it happens a lot. No matter who you are or how many credentials you leverage, you’re bound to get hit by the red ink.', 'It’s what you do next that may mitigate the damage, bringing us to tax-loss stocks. With 2023 soon coming to a close, the concept of tax loss harvesting becomes that much more attractive. Basically, this strategy involves offsetting your capital gains with capital losses. That way, you may potentially reduce your net tax liability.', 'Even if you don’t have much capital gains to offset in 2023, in general, you can carry capital losses forward indefinitely; hence, the phrase tax loss harvesting. And let’s not forget the added benefit of stocks to sell for tax losses. By cutting off the pain now, you can prevent further damage associated with particularly troublesome enterprises.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Still, none of this should be considered tax advice because I’m not a tax professional.

Primarily, the company reported third-quarter earnings results that disappointed analysts and investors. Specifically, its net income slipped 16% year-over-year to $1.61 billion. That said, it did record an increase in revenue. Yet that also raised eyebrows regarding the bottom-line underperformance.', 'Since dropping heavily, BCS did manage to pop up, although it could be a dead-cat bounce. Earlier, management discussed the need for more restructuring to offset income pressure. In addition, investment bank income slid on muted market activity. This last point is concerning because it seemingly contradicts the return-of-the-bull-market thesis.', 'In addition, when Barclays fell following its Q3 disclosure, it sparked sector-wide weakness in the financial space. Yes, BCS is technically undervalued but that could turn into a value trap if the broader economy doesn’t cooperate.', 'Plus, analysts rate shares a moderate sell.

Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) personally stinks for me because I earlier thought it may have a chance to rise above the muck. Sure, the sudden surge in investor participation due to meme stocks represented an odd but welcome sight. But once that phenomenon faded, entities like T. Rowe simply failed to reignite the fire.', 'It’s not that TROW is truly awful. Since the start of the year, shares dipped 11%. Over the trailing 52 weeks, they’re down almost 20%. These aren’t encouraging performances but they’re not the worst case of red ink I’ve seen. However, for the longest time, TROW just went sideways. While I’m sure speculators don’t mind picking up the 5% forward yield, the payout ratio of 73.15% is fairly steep.', 'Now, over the past month, TROW gained 8%, probably on the anticipation of short covering. Per Fintel’s options flow screener, institutional traders sold near-expiry calls with a $100 strike price. So, it’s possible that TROW could pop near term.', 'However, T. Rowe failed to excite investors, leading to a moderate sell assessment among analysts.

So, in the past 365 days, if you had bought shares in early December 2022, early April of this year and on Sept. 20, you’d be looking at some red ink. Second and more critically, GlaxoSmithKline could be losing momentum. Sure, it posted a strong boost in sales in the third quarter. However, on a trailing-12-month basis (TTM), revenue sits at around $36.57 billion.', 'That’s far lower than the $44.24 billion in sales the biotech rang up in 2019.

The company has run some local direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives, notably in parts of the world where it lacks reimbursement, but generally, it has relied on broader awareness of sleep apnea and patients independently seeking care to support market growth.', 'Resmed’s\xa0recent restructuring of its leadership team, which created heads of product, marketing and revenue, is part of a push to pay more attention to demand generation, as the William Blair analysts said in a note to investors.', '“These efforts are in their early days, and we expect it to take some time to scale and prove its [return on investment], although we believe this shift toward driving market growth is one that should pay off, particularly as sleep health and awareness is increasing,” the analysts wrote. “As the market leader, Resmed should see a higher ROI in driving patients on therapy.”', 'The analysts see little opportunity for Resmed to grow by further increasing its market share. As such, the company’s potential to outpace current market growth, which the analysts estimate is mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks, rests on its ability to stimulate demand. Resmed has a lot of headroom, with management suggesting market penetration is in the mid-teens today.', 'In addition to marketing, Resmed’s management is looking to new products to drive growth, with quieter and smaller devices as a priority. There is also scope for the diagnosis of sleep apnea to improve, both as big tech companies add sleep monitoring features to wearables and as Resmed works to increase use of its own home-testing device, Night Owl by Ectosense.', 'Fueling growth through demand generation and device development could help allay investor concerns about the future of the sleep apnea market. The William Blair analysts cited concerns about the impact of weight loss drugs on demand for sleep apnea devices as a driver of a 35% fall in Resmed’s share price from the highs it hit earlier this year.\xa0', 'Fewer people who are overweight or obese could mean fewer cases of sleep apnea, and Eli Lilly is running a late-phase trial to assess the effect of its GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide on people with obstructive sleep apnea. Resmed is “indifferent to the results,” according to the analysts. Executives expect the study results to show a 50% to 60% drop in a measure of sleep apnea, but that will still leave many people with clinically meaningful disease, the analysts wrote.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

Recently, Director T Glenn of Pentair PLC (NYSE:PNR) made a notable move by selling 2,260 shares of the company on December 1, 2023. This transaction has caught the attention of market watchers and raises questions about the insider's perspective on the stock's future."", ""T Glenn serves as a Director at Pentair PLC, a role that involves oversight and strategic guidance for the company. Directors are privy to in-depth knowledge about the company's operations, financial health, and future prospects. Their trading activities, whether buying or selling shares, are often interpreted as a signal of their confidence in the company's performance and outlook."", ""Pentair PLC is a global company specializing in water treatment and sustainable solutions. The company operates through various segments, including Aquatic Systems, Filtration Solutions, and Flow Technologies. Pentair's products and services cater to a wide range of needs, from residential and commercial pool equipment to water purification and fluid management solutions. With a focus on innovation and sustainability, Pentair aims to deliver smart, energy-efficient products that help manage the world's water resources."", ""The insider's recent sale of 2,260 shares is part of a broader pattern observed over the past year. T Glenn has exclusively engaged in selling activities, with a total of 2,260 shares sold and no shares purchased. This one-sided transaction history could suggest a lack of buying interest at current price levels from the insider's perspective.The insider transaction history for Pentair PLC shows a lack of insider buys over the past year, with zero purchases recorded. On the other hand, there have been four insider sells during the same period. This trend may indicate that insiders, including T Glenn, are more inclined to reduce their holdings rather than increase them."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of Pentair PLC were trading at $64.4, giving the company a market cap of $10.995 billion. This price point is significant as it reflects the market's valuation of the company in relation to its earnings and growth prospects.The price-earnings ratio of Pentair PLC stands at 21.67, which is slightly lower than the industry median of 22.44. This indicates that the stock is trading at a discount compared to its industry peers. However, it is higher than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio, suggesting that the stock may not be as undervalued as it has been in the past.When considering the GuruFocus Value, which is set at $63.46, Pentair PLC has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.01. This ratio implies that the stock is Fairly Valued based on its intrinsic value estimate. The GF Value is determined by historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates from analysts."", ""The insider selling activity by Director T Glenn at Pentair PLC, particularly in the absence of any insider buying over the past year, may raise some eyebrows among investors. While the company's stock is deemed Fairly Valued according to the GF Value, the insider's decision to sell could be interpreted in various ways. It might reflect a personal financial decision, a belief that the stock is fully valued, or a response to market conditions.Investors should consider the broader context of the company's performance, industry trends, and overall market sentiment when evaluating the implications of insider trading activity. While insider transactions can provide valuable insights, they are just one piece of the puzzle in the complex decision-making process of investing."", 'Warning!

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', ""Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price.

While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.', ""As previously touched on, Mondelez International is a growing business, which is encouraging.

However, after Walmart (WMT) warned these drugs could be impacting its food sales, some investors became concerned about what it could mean for food-related stocks. Arun Sundaram, CFRA Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the impact GLP-1 drugs have had on the market and whether investors should continue to be worried about the growing trend in its use.', 'Sundaram says plainly: ""I think the near-term reaction to these GLP-1 drugs are bit overblown, if you look at the stocks for a lot of consumer-related names, a lot of food-related names, they are down significantly ever since that topic became pretty popular a few months ago but, that\'s something that all companies are monitoring still. It\'s too early to tell the exact impact in terms of food and beverage consumption.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""JOSH LIPTON: And Arun, another big theme for the companies you cover, these weight loss drugs, Arun, obviously, a tremendous amount of investor curiosity, interest, in those drugs. You can look at the stock charts of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. How do you think about, Arun, how those drugs are going to potentially affect the companies you cover? Not so much near intermediate term, but even long term, Arun, what's the risk for those companies? And how are those companies responding right now?"", ""ARUN SUNDARAM: Yeah. I mean, I think the near term reaction to this GLP drugs are a bit overblown. If you look at the stocks for a lot of consumer-related names, a lot of food-related names, they're down significantly ever since that topic became pretty popular a few months ago. But that's something that you really all companies are monitoring still. It's too early to tell the exact impact in terms of food and beverage consumption."", ""It could, over time, it could have a modest impact on food consumption. Maybe 1% to 3% of total food intake could be down over the longer term. But I think the good news for at least food manufacturers and food retailers is that they have time to prepare for this. This is going to be potentially a theme that we'll be talking about for the next decade is these GLP-1 drugs."", ""And what a lot of food companies will likely do is they'll reevaluate. They'll potentially introduce more smaller pack sizes, for example, or maybe they'll change their ingredients in some of their food products. Maybe some food companies will sell off some underperforming brands and try to acquire some higher performing brands."", ""So I think the good news is that they have time. And nobody needs to make any drastic decision right now in terms of maybe exiting certain product lines or brands or things like that. Nothing extreme has been done yet. So I think everyone's really just monitoring it and waiting for any impact on sales or margins."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And Arun, before we let you go, I know you have holds on a lot of the companies, the food companies, in your coverage universe. Is there anything that you have a buy on that you think is going to do a little bit better going into next year?', ""ARUN SUNDARAM: Yeah. So I mean, during this whole GLP-1 popularity, when a lot of these food-related names got pretty hit pretty hard, we did we did make some upgrades. And packaged foods our top pick. In packaged foods is Mondelez. They're, in our view, the best management team in amongst packaged foods, consistent execution, solid dividend. They buy back shares. They're really big in emerging markets, which is where the growth really is. And first and foremost, they're a snacking company. And that's historically been one of the fastest growing areas of the grocery store."", 'So Mondelez is our top pick in packaged foods. And our second pick is the Kraft Heinz Company. And we also made an upgrade to Kraft Heinz a few months ago from a hold to a buy. Kraft Heinz is a buy, but Mondelez International is a strong buy for us.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Arun, thank you, as always, for coming on the show. It's always good to see you."", 'ARUN SUNDARAM: Yeah. Thanks for having me.']"

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Electric's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:', '37% = US$11b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.37 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""First thing first, we like that General Electric has an impressive ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 31%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. As a result, General Electric's remarkable 62% net income growth seen over the past 5 years is likely aided by its high ROE."", ""As a next step, we compared General Electric's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 59% in the same period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is GE fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""General Electric's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 3.4% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (97%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company."", ""Additionally, General Electric has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 4.8% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 19% over the same period."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with General Electric's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Procter & Gamble ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$15.4b', 'US$16.3b', 'US$17.3b', 'US$18.6b', 'US$19.7b', 'US$20.6b', 'US$21.4b', 'US$22.1b', 'US$22.8b', 'US$23.4b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 4.50%', 'Est @ 3.82%', 'Est @ 3.34%', 'Est @ 3.00%', 'Est @ 2.77%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$14.5k', 'US$14.5k', 'US$14.4k', 'US$14.6k', 'US$14.6k', 'US$14.3k', 'US$14.0k', 'US$13.6k', 'US$13.2k', 'US$12.8k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$141b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$23b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$598b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$598b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$327b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$467b.

Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter & Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is PG a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for P&G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $6.42.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&G.

(Nasdaq: SRCL), a leading provider of medical waste management and secure information destruction solutions, today released its third annual Healthcare Workplace Safety Trend Report\xa0revealing how providers and administrators in the U.S. view health and safety in their organizations and its impact on peers, patients and surrounding communities. New this year, the study also surveyed consumers about their concerns with safety when seeking care. The report aims to provide valuable insights on the challenges the industry and patients face today and how to best help healthcare organizations understand their safety profiles, improve workplace safety standards, create a quality care environment and reduce impacts on the environment.', ""This year's key findings found 9 in 10 of the Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and consumers surveyed agree that medical waste management is important in delivering the best possible patient care. Most of the HCPs and administrators surveyed say that improper medical waste disposal puts the physical safety (95% HCPs; 87% administrators) and emotional well-being (79% HCPs; 85% administrators) of HCPs at risk, and they would not be able to do their jobs effectively without proper medical waste management (84% HCPs; 81% administrators). However, 2 in 3 of the HCPs surveyed said they feel they do not have a strong understanding of how their organization disposes of medical waste and feel there could be more training and resources available."", '""Following the pandemic, the U.S. healthcare system remains under stress but is working to address challenges and opportunities such as the staffing shortage and the desire for increased access to at-home care,"" said Cory White, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Stericycle. ""It is important that organizations not lose sight of the fundamentals that impact provider satisfaction and patient care. This year\'s report shows that the industry might need to re-focus on one of those requirements — healthcare safety — to ensure providers feel safe, well-trained and competent in their work environments and that patients feel secure in their care.""', 'Additional insights from the report include:', 'Stress Levels Have Decreased After the Peak of the Pandemic But Remain High: While negative feelings from HCPs have decreased since 2021, they are still remarkably high as we continue to face new COVID-19 variants. Sixty-three percent of the HCPs surveyed said they are exhibiting negative feelings (e.g., ""Stressed"", ""Burnt-out"", ""Exhausted"") at work, and only a quarter of HCPs feel ""Safe"" in their roles. Forty-four percent of the HCPs surveyed are feeling worse about their level of day-to-day stress than the previous year.', 'Ongoing Staffing and Patient Challenges are Perpetuating Burnout: Issues of understaffing, patient volume, workload, hours and administrative burdens are the top reasons why HCPs (primarily providers) reported feeling burnt-out, exhausted, or distracted at work. A more troubling trend, many of the HCPs surveyed said they believe that patients are refusing recommended care (60%), behaving poorly (53%) and becoming combative (46%) more frequently compared to last year. Almost two-thirds (63%) are concerned that they will be injured at work as a result.', 'Proper Disposal of Medical Waste is Essential but Misunderstood: While 95% of the HCPs surveyed agree that improper disposal of medical waste puts the physical safety of HCP workers at risk, only 33% strongly agree that they have a solid understanding of how their organization handles this type of waste. Improper handling and disposal are recognized as major concerns, which can negatively impact both the safety of workers and patients, but a shortage of personnel is hindering the possibility of top-quality care.', 'Risks to the Environment Cannot Be Overlooked: Over 90% of the HCPs surveyed agree that improper medical/biohazardous waste management can harm the environment and/or have long-lasting impacts on health and well-being. Despite recognizing the harmful impacts on the environment, 37% of the HCPs said they do not believe their organizations are doing enough to reduce those impacts. Many do not believe their organizations have innovative practices (60%) or enough staff and monetary resources for proper regulated medical/biohazardous waste disposal (59%).', 'The Rise of At-Home Care Generates New Challenges For Healthcare Workers: Nearly all HCPs surveyed agree that at-home care settings introduce new challenges for proper disposal of pharmaceutical and medical waste and the ability to provide the best care. Unhygienic conditions, entering/working alone, and in-home violence are seen as the three biggest risks to HCP worker safety in at-home care settings.', ""Amidst an Opioid Epidemic, Drug Diversion Requires Proactive Measures: Alongside a worsening opioid epidemic, 95% of the HCPs surveyed believe that many healthcare consumers keep their leftover prescription drugs for future use and don't know how to properly dispose of them (93%). Many consumers are not as familiar with the dangers of drug diversion or its impact on the opioid epidemic, with just 77% of respondents saying that drug diversion puts the community at risk, compared to 92% of HCPs."", 'These findings emphasize the need for a greater awareness of\xa0HCP and patient safety and what specific aspects of daily care could be improved to protect their health and well-being.', 'This study surveyed 500 healthcare professionals, including 400 healthcare practitioners (those who have direct patient interaction and currently practice as a physician, nurse, or another related role) and 100 administrators (those who are currently at an executive leadership or senior management level in a healthcare organization.)

A decade ago, it led a multi-airline effort to push travel agents to adopt new technology, known by the shorthand new distribution capability, or NDC.', 'American Airlines has used carrots and sticks to get agents to adopt NDC. Earlier this year, it pulled about 40% of its fare inventory out of the old system.', 'The largest travel management companies (TMCs) and online travel agencies have had the resources to adopt the new tech.', 'However, many smaller travel agencies say the cost and training effort to learn the new workflows is overwhelming. They want a more gradual roll-out.', 'Many of American’s cheapest fares are now only purchasable through NDC channels. That places smaller travel agencies at “a massive competitive disadvantage” to American’s direct booking website and the better capitalized online travel agencies, ASTA said.', 'Small-to-midsized agencies say they need time to cope with the changes in how ticketing inventory is displayed and controlled. Today, they can’t efficiently service bookings (such as changing or canceling reservations), exchanging tickets, or booking certain itineraries). ', 'Duty of care is a legal requirement for employers to know the whereabouts of their employees and any potential risks involved in employee travel. Edifact systems support this, while NDC technologies do not, hindering TMCs from doing their work, says ASTA.', 'In August, agency group ASTA filed its DOT complaint that American Airlines is essentially using its market dominance to bully them by limiting them from offering customers a broad comparison of flight options and prices.', 'ASTA said NDC, in its current state of development, impairs service and efficiency for the nearly 50% of all travelers who book air tickets through a travel agency or TMC.', 'American Airlines responded to the DOT complaint in November, accusing the association of stifling innovation.', 'Skift asked ASTA to reply to how American Airlines defended itself to regulators last month.

Across the board, and without exception, the average NDC channel fare was lower, in some cases, by more than 50%.', 'In their DOT filing, AA intimates that NDC already includes robust functionality. This readiness is overstated.', 'While the items listed in AA’s response regarding functionality are accurate, its [workflow] is also very limited in terms of functionality and only available as individual components and for new NDC reservations only.', 'What’s lacking from AA’s response is how atrocious the workflow is for new reservations.', 'We disagree with AA’s assertion that agencies are grasping onto the old ways of managing travel. Most travel agencies and TMCs lack the deep pockets of an airline or a major online travel agency to invest in proprietary solutions. We rely on third-party companies to enable our business.', 'The premise of the question — that the interests of consumers are in opposition to the interests of travel agencies and TMCs with respect to NDC — is simply false.', 'Nor is it accurate to characterize agencies as reluctant to adapt to new technologies.', 'Rather, it is about the ability of agencies and TMCs to provide the level of service the clients have come to expect without forcing them to choose between obtaining the lowest fare or forsaking … the duty of care obligations businesses owe to their employees when they travel on behalf of their employer.', 'American is using this claim to avoid taking responsibility for the very real duty of care problems [Outlined in page 34 of the complaint PDF] these changes are causing.', 'Framing the issue this way misses the point, as it’s not a question of the superiority of one technology over another. Again, it’s about readiness.', 'American’s answer mischaracterizes ASTA’s position on NDC and technology generally.', 'ASTA is not anti-NDC. We fully support the adoption of modern retailing methods when the necessary technologies are ready and in place.

The Phase 2 trial was designed to compare vorolanib to Eylea on several measures, including its impact on visual acuity, and assess whether the latter medicine was “non-inferior” to Regeneron’s.', '“Since EYP-1901 achieved statistical non-inferiority to the [Eylea] control in this trial there is potential for meaningfully lower sized and lower cost pivotal Phase 3 trials,” said Jay Duker, EyePoint’s CEO, using the medicine’s code name in a Monday statement.', 'The company plans to discuss its Phase 3 plans with the Food and Drug Administration, and start its first pivotal trial in the “wet” form of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, in the second half of next year.', 'EyePoint shares rose by as much as 232% early Monday morning, before settling back to trade up 176%.

Widespread disruptions on UP’s network during the first three quarters of this year, such as Tropical Storm Hilary in Southern California, have prompted UP to cut back on spending for budgeting reasons, including deferring some capital projects until 2024, according to BMWED, which is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.', 'Industry historically furloughed on a roughly seasonal basis until the railroads came under fire from federal regulators because of possible links between diminishing head count levels and deteriorating rail service. They are different from layoffs because furloughs imply that a worker may return to his or her job after a period of time, whereas layoffs imply that a person was let go from a company.', 'The Nov. 22 letter to the board from BMWED President Tony Cardwell and three union general chairmen also said UP hasn’t implemented large furloughs since 2015.', '“While Union Pacific has assured the [Surface Transportation] Board that it is attempting to increase its workforce to improve resiliency (and foreswore future reliance on furloughs at the embargoes hearing, at the first whiff of a decline in profits (from record levels), Union Pacific has resorted to furloughs that are unprecedented in recent memory,” the letter said. “Union Pacific’s ability to recruit and retain skilled and highly qualified workers will be hindered by its cavalier treatment of its current workforce. The furloughs will agitate and destabilize the workforce, delay planned maintenance, impose unrealistic work expectations on Maintenance of Way employees, and undo the recruitment efforts of 2023.”', 'Cardwell’s Nov. 22 letter referred to and questioned Whited’s remarks at the conference, saying that maintenance-of-way (MOW) employees were discouraged from using vacation time during the holidays. The time off in December is not a reward but a furlough, he said.', '“When Union Pacific imposes layoffs, it is not ‘allowing’ employees to take off work,” Cardwell said.', 'UP told FreightWaves on Monday that it could not pin down how many employees could be affected because a variety of circumstances play into furloughing decisions, including which positions are seasonal, when people go on vacation and whether people decide to seek employment elsewhere on the railroad instead of returning to their own jobs. The railroad also said that furloughs are a temporary work stoppage that occurs when work is not available but that UP intends to bring furloughed workers back to ensure it can continue to meet service and safety standards.', 'The Western U.S. Class I railroad pointed FreightWaves to a statement that it provided during the conference on the furloughs, which was that “accusations that Union Pacific does not invest in its infrastructure and maintenance are untrue. This year alone, the railroad will spend $3.7 billion on capital investment, of which a significant portion is allotted for maintenance.', '“As part of the capital planning process, we are temporarily reducing some seasonal track maintenance positions. These seasonal shutdowns allow us to realign the work based on the upcoming year’s capital plan. Not all impacted jobs will result in employees being furloughed. Furloughs depend on a number of factors, including remaining paid time off, the number of open jobs and employee preference.”', 'Meanwhile, BMWED spokesperson Clark Bellew told FreightWaves on Monday that UP has indicated that it could furlough about 1,350 MOW employees. That number is concerning particularly because it could include not only newly hired employees but also long-tenured employees who have expertise and experience, Bellew said. BMWED, which is scheduled to meet with UP this week, is also uncertain how many furloughed employees will actually return to UP.', '“It’ll be well worth watching if they bring back all 1,350 (we don’t expect they will because this is part of the [precision scheduled railroading] strategy). They might offer to bring some back but people can’t be out of work for months in limbo when they have bills to pay, so they will look for other work and write UP off,” Bellew said in an email. “They’ll claim they tried to bring back everyone but they know full well they will lose some employees and that is what they want. That saves them money.”', 'BMWED had reached out to STB in part because it argues that UP’s proposed plan to cut back on spending — which BMWED views as a means to lower UP’s operating ratio — could also adversely affect service levels, which is an issue that the board has been monitoring.', 'OR is a metric that investors sometimes use to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved financial health. The unions, including BMWED, have accused the Class I railroads of seeking to achieve lower OR as the impetus for the railroads’ implementation of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), a method adopted by the Class I railroads to streamline operations and lower costs.', 'BMWED argued that the furloughs also reflect a trend of diminishing headcount at UP within the last 10 years. While the Class I railroads have furloughed in the past, “historical patterns clearly demonstrate that significant workforce reductions through systematic furloughs tend to have enduring circumstances,” said BMWED’s Oct. 27 letter to STB.', 'UP “told the STB this year that they would increase workforce and they are brazenly and recklessly doing the opposite. They have not completed their scheduled planned track maintenance projects they set at the beginning of this year. They have work to do to get the track up to snuff, but that requires more investment than PSR is willing to devote,” BMWED’s Bellew said Monday.', '“These types of furloughs haven’t occurred in the industry in several decades. They were once fairly common on a seasonal basis, but these carriers are so consolidated now that they can simply reassign production to the southern regions of their territories to avoid winter weather disruptions. U.P. is a 32,000 mile territory in 23 states. There is work to be done. Important work to ensure that they keep trains upright and communities safe,” Bellew continued.', 'While STB hasn’t formally responded to the letters aside from Oberman’s remarks at RailTrends, the board is monitoring the situation.', 'The specter of furloughs comes as labor attorney Richard S. Edelman submitted a separate and unrelated filing last week to STB about the Class I railroads’ consistently lower head count levels since the four main U.S. Class I railroads each individually adopted measures related to PSR, if not PSR itself, starting in 2017.', 'While head count levels have risen at the four main U.S. Class I railroads last year and this year, they are still hovering around levels seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, according to monthly employment data that the railroads submit to STB.', 'However, these reductions in head count levels have “far exceeded the reductions in carloadings,” which means that “the reductions in numbers of employees has significantly increased the responsibilities (and attendant extra work time) for the employees who remain,” Edelman said.', 'The “Big 4” Class I railroads — UP, BNSF, CSX and Norfolk Southern — “have asserted that they have made strides in improving service and have increased employment; and they have rejected criticisms of their safety record, claiming that the number of derailments has been reduced in comparison to the number of derailments in the early 2000s. … [But] with respect to employment and service, the Big 4 are like a high jumper who sets the bar a foot off the ground, steps over it and awards himself/herself a medal,” Edelman said in his filing last Tuesday.', '“The increases in employment have been minuscule in comparison to prior reductions in employment; and the improvements in service have taken service on some carriers from bad to substandard and others from abysmal to bad,” he said.', 'Edelman also argued that the industry’s interpretation of Federal Railroad Administration’s data showing a decrease in train derailments since 2000 is flawed because that data doesn’t reflect the reduction in train starts. Rather, Edelman argued that STB and others should look at FRA data on accidents/incidents per million train miles, which accounts for fewer but longer trains and shows that incidents have increased over the last decade.', '“The Unions respectfully urge the Board to continue to press the railroads on the adequacy of the service they provide, and the adequacy of their workforces to provide levels of service that satisfy their common carrier obligations. The Unions again urge the Board to do all it can to enforce service standards and the common carrier obligation, and to advise Congress if the Board feels that it currently lacks sufficient authority to remedy service problems and enforce the common carrier,” Edelman said.', 'Edelman’s filing was submitted to Ex Parte 770, the proceeding on urgent issues in freight rail service.', 'In addition to representing BMWED before the board, Edelman also represents the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Mechanical Division; the International Association of Boilermakers; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District #19; the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers – 32BJ/SEIU; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen affiliated with IBT; and the Transport Workers Union of America.', 'When asked about Edelman’s filing, the Association of American Railroads directed FreightWaves to its filing from July 7 to EP 770.', 'In that filing, the trade association representing freight railroads said that “the past decade has been the safest in railroad history,” with the hazardous materials accident rate down 76% from 2000 and the accident rate for Class I trains traveling on railroad mainlines down 48% between 2000 and 2022.', 'AAR also pointed to climbing employment totals, saying in its July filing that May was the 16th straight month in which the number of train and engine employees grew.', '“While more hiring needs to and will be done, railroads are confident they will continue successfully recruiting the next generation of railroad workers to meet the nation’s rail freight demand,” AAR said.', 'Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.', 'STB’s Oberman rips into Union Pacific CEO Vena', 'Union Pacific furloughs workers due to lower volumes', 'Unions criticize practice of furloughing in the rail industry', '5 questions you might ask about freight train accidents', 'The post Maintenance-of-way rail union and Union Pacific tussle over furloughs appeared first on FreightWaves.']"
