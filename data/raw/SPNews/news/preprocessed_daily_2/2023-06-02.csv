It has amassed assets over $9.24 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.57%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 16% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB) accounts for about 2.88% of total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ).The top 10 holdings account for about 18.38% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskSCHV seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index containing the large-cap value portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has lost about -2.85% so far this year and is down about -4.05% in the last one year (as of 06/02/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $58.51 and $69.30.The ETF has a beta of 0.94 and standard deviation of 16.96% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 519 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHV is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $48.60 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $98.78 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Financial services provider, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) traded lower, as the sudden run on Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits sparked investor concerns about the health of the U.S. financial system. While we believe the actions taken by the Fed were well constructed and have proved effective thus far in walling off the contagion, we acknowledge SCHW may be impacted by a reduced earnings trajectory near-term as cash sorting has increased the need for more expensive short term funding sources. Meanwhile, the company addressed the cash sorting environment noting three key sources of liquidity and confirming over 80% of total bank deposits are FDIC insured. Amidst this backdrop, we continue to believe SCHW’s risk/reward is skewed to the upside and expect the company to weather these pressures by flexing its scale and customer-centric focus in support of its industry leading cost advantage. We also think the TD Ameritrade acquisition will continue to create incremental value and further enhance SCHW’s marketplace standing and long-term growth trajectory.""Story continuesfinance, investmenteverything possible/Shutterstock.comThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Texas Instruments'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:54% = US$8.3b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.54.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 54% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Texas Instruments has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Texas Instruments was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Texas Instruments' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 32% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Texas Instruments''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Texas Instruments Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Texas Instruments has a three-year median payout ratio of 53% (which means it retains 47% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Texas Instruments has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 65% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 43%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we feel that Texas Instruments certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

The U.S. oil producer is targeting a market it calculates has potential to reach $4 trillion globally by 2050.The contract value was not disclosed. The technology needs to gain scale before becoming profitable.Unlike its European peers, which are investing in traditional renewable energies like solar and wind, Exxon's $17 billion energy transition strategy is mostly focused on reducing emissions from its own operations and charging clients to do the same for them.Exxon will capture, transport and store up to 800,000 metric tons (Mt) per year of carbon CO2 from Nucor's manufacturing site in Convent, Louisiana, starting in 2026. The site produces a raw material used to make steel, a highly polluting process.The deal brings Exxon's CCS customers to 5 Mt per year.There are around 35 commercial facilities in the world applying carbon capture and sequestration, with a 45 Mt capacity, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Project developers have announced ambitions for over 200 new capture facilities to be operating by 2030, capturing over 220 Mt per year, the IEA says.Exxon calculates CCS annual volumes would need to expand to 7.6 billion Mt by 2050 for the world to achieve the IEA's Net Zero Emissions scenario.

""We are taking a multi-faceted approach to decarbonization, and this partnership builds on previous investments we have made in a carbon-free iron start-up, renewable energy generation, and the development of small modular nuclear reactor technology.""The project is expected to start-up in 2026 and supports Louisiana's objective of reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.""This collaboration with Nucor is the latest example of how we're delivering on our mission to help accelerate the world's path to net zero,"" said Dan Ammann, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon, ExxonMobil. ""We look forward to applying our technology and expertise to reducing emissions for Nucor.""With its recycling-based production method, Nucor is already one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world. The circular nature of remelting recycled scrap in electric arc furnaces means that Nucor's steel mills generate roughly two-thirds less than the carbon dioxide of extractive blast furnace steelmaking plants, even when accounting for Scope 3 emissions, which include all upstream and downstream emissions in the supply chain. Nucor is one of the first steel companies to disclose its Scope 3 emissions. This carbon capture and storage agreement with ExxonMobil furthers Nucor's status as a sustainability leader and builds on the innovation that has enabled the company to produce steel and steel products with low embodied carbon.Story continuesAbout NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The company has been rallying on innovative lighting solutions and energy-efficient luminaries’ portfolio. Business re-alignment and cost-control measures are added benefits.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this manufacturer and distributor of lighting fixtures’ earnings suggests 7.1% year-over-year growth. It is to be noted that earnings topped analysts’ expectations in the trailing 12 quarters, depicting optimism surrounding its prospects.However, extensive research and development involve high costs. Although the incremental cost of the technology is relatively low, the real cost of its installation is still growing. Again, inflation and higher cost of inputs could dampen its overall results. The industry is going through supply chain challenges and the rising cost of some components. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s check out the factors mitigating these headwinds and allowing this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to grow further.Factors Driving GrowthDiversified Lighting Portfolio: Acuity Brands keeps on diversifying its product portfolio through continuously innovating of energy-efficient luminaries and lighting control solutions. In response to rapidly changing market trends, Acuity Brands is continually expanding its portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries. It introduced around 220 new and upgraded lighting and lighting control products over the last two years (through fiscal 2022).During the NEXT 23 annual sales conference, the company introduced various products. One of them was the new nLight AIR System Input Device, which is an indoor controller that can be used in multiple spaces, including office, commercial and retail. Another product was the nLight AIR rPOD Micro. It is a battery-powered wall switch that can be used as a traditional wall switch or as a remote, providing control from anywhere within a building space.The company also focuses on reducing customer energy consumption, reducing packaging and waste and improving transportation efficiency. Acuity Brands has expanded its capabilities to provide a broad portfolio of leading germicidal UV products.Segments Re-Alignment: Acuity Brands has reorganized the business into two units: Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls ""ABL"" and Intelligent Spaces Group ""ISG"". ABL includes lighting, lighting controls and components businesses and ISG offers building management systems as well as location-aware applications, including Distech and Atrius.Through the beginning of fiscal 2022, the company’s Trevor and the rest of the ABL team have continued to focus on high product vitality, elevate service levels and use technologies to differentiate its performance from others. For ISG, the company mainly focuses on technologies to solve problems in spaces by making them smarter, safer and greener.Cost-Saving Approach: AYI has undertaken various cost-saving actions that are expected to improve margins. These efforts include realignment of headcount with current volumes, a freeze on all non-essential employee travel, efforts to decrease discretionary spending and planned reductions in its real estate footprint. In the fiscal second quarter, adjusted EBITDA rose 6.5% and adjusted operating profit grew 5% from the prior-year period.Superior ROE: Acuity Brands’ superior return on equity (ROE) is also indicative of its growth potential. The company’s ROE currently stands at 22.2% versus the industry’s negative 2%. This indicates efficiency in using its shareholders’ funds and AYI’s ability to generate profit with minimum capital usage.Story continuesKey PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are:Sterling Infrastructure, Inc.

Shares have lost about 1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Unum due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Unum Group Q1 Earnings, Revenues Top Estimates, View UpUnum Group’ first-quarter 2023 operating net income of $1.87 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.3% and our estimate of $1.64. The bottom line increased 37.5% year over year.The quarterly results reflected continued strong operating performance, core business premium trends that are nearing long-term growth expectations, improved core operations sales, stable persistency, premium growth and continued favorable benefits experience.Operational UpdateTotal operating revenues of Unum Group were $3 billion, up 1.3% year over year, as higher premium income and other income were offset by lower net investment income. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%, Our estimate was $3.1 billion.Premium increased 2.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.5 billion and was in line with our estimate.Total benefits and expenses decreased 5.1% year over year to $2.6 billion, largely attributable to lower benefits and changes in reserves for future benefits.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.6 billion, up 4.3% year over year. The figure was in line with our estimate.Adjusted operating income surged 85.7% year over year to $312.5 million, attributable to higher income in the group disability line, group life and accidental death and dismemberment line as well as supplemental and voluntary line of business.Unum International: Premium income of $188.6 million increased 0.5% year over year.  This compares unfavorably with our estimate of $198.5 million. Adjusted operating income was $38.4 million, up 48.3% year over year.The Unum U.K. line of business premium income was £133.9 million, up 9.1% from the year-ago quarter due to in-force block growth and higher sales. Adjusted operating income, in local currency, of £31 million was up 66.7% from a year ago.The benefit ratio was 68.5, which improved 1270 basis points (bps) due to favorable claim resolutions driven by higher mortality in the group long-term disability product line, higher discount rates on new claims, and lower inflation-linked experience in benefits, partially offset by higher mortality in the group life product line. Sales increased 37.8%.Persistency increased in group long-term disability but decreased in group life business and supplemental line of business.Colonial Life: Premium income decreased 0.3% from the prior-year figure to $429.5 million due to lower persistency, partially offset by higher prior period sales. The figure compared unfavorably with our estimate of $436.8 million.Sales increased 2.7% from the year-ago figure to $106.8 million. Adjusted operating income increased 8.7% from the prior-year period to $93.9 million.Persistency was 77.3%, which improved 140 bps year over year.The benefit ratio improved 20 bps year over year to 53, primarily driven by favorable mortality experience in the life product line as a result of the easing of the impact of COVID-19 on the insured population, partially offset by unfavorable benefits experience in the cancer and critical illness product lines.Closed Block: Adjusted operating income was $58.2 million, which decreased 26% year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $33.5 million, narrower than a loss of $40.4 million in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesCapital ManagementAs of Mar 31, 2023, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 425%.Unum Group exited 2022 with liquidity worth $1.3 billion.Book value per share grew 37.3% year over year to $46.85 as of Mar 31, 2023.Unum Group bought back 1.3 shares for $53.6 million.GuidanceUNM expects adjusted operating income per share to increase 20% to 25%, up from the prior guidance of an 8-12% increase.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted 8.35% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Unum has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Stefan LarssonStory continuesStefan LarssonThank you, Sheryl. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We had a strong start to 2023, delivering performance ahead of expectations for both the top and bottom line, driven by our disciplined execution of the PVH+ plan. We grew first quarter revenue up 5% in constant currency and up 2% on a reported basis despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year, reflecting the confidence we have in our ability to continue to execute with Impact while being prudent given the choppy macro. We are well positioned to deliver solid top line growth in addition to double-digit EPS growth, at the same time, making strategic investments in areas such as marketing, the shopping experience and the supply chain to drive long-term brand accretive growth. I'm starting to see leaders all around the company, leveraging the clarity of direction from the PVH+ plan and drive progress in their areas, progress that is repeatable and scalable. And and some of it contributes to drive the performance here and now and some you will see the results come over time. But as a leader, having done this a few times, I know that when I see my leaders whether it's significant product and marketing improvements in Calvin, igniting the influencer marketing and D2C for Tommy in North America or a new global brand campaign for Tommy connecting back to the brand's DNA or supply chain improvements globally or a new level of cost efficiency work led by our finance team then I know that we're underway to transform this company. I feel very good about how we deliver on our near-term commitments while maintaining a strong focus on our long-term vision to build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and position PVH as 1 of the best-performing brand groups in our sector. Our PVH+ plan guides us on this journey and is centered around 5 key growth drivers. The first is winning with product. The second is winning with consumer engagement. The third is winning in the digitally led marketplace. The fourth is developing a demand and data-driven operating model, and the fifth is to drive efficiencies and invest in growth. Let me start by sharing an update on how we deliver against each. Everything starts with winning with product. It's the most important part of the brand promise, driving brand desirability and building consumer loyalty over time. Having the best product in the market gives us pricing power and drives margin expansion. In the first quarter, we made significant strides here. We continue to advance our category offers and delivered double-digit growth in key hero products, such as the 1985 Polo program for Tommy and the modern cotton underwear program for Calvin. These bestsellers are examples of products that are essentials to the consumers' wardrobe. Even though we are already driving increasing strength in hero Products, we're just in the beginning of tapping into our full potential. We then win with consumer engagement by connecting our hero products with culturally relevant aspirational talent. This comes to life in 3 ways. First, we develop cut-through brand campaigns every season. Second, we ignite the power of our influencer engine; and third, we elevate the consumer experience at every touch point. In Q1, you saw this executed really well in both Calvin and Tommy, generating very strong consumer engagement with billions of impressions across both brands. I'll share more specific proof points in my brand update in a moment. What I want to emphasize here, though, is that these campaigns form a powerful brand halo and ignite our talent and influence ranging globally. As we shared with you last quarter, we are stepping up our investments here in a very targeted way. In addition to increasing our strategic investments in marketing, we are enhancing the brand experience across all consumer touch points to win in the digitally led marketplace. For the quarter, on a constant currency basis, we drove double-digit growth in our D2C businesses, which included double-digit growth in our stores and high single-digit growth in our own and operated e-commerce. Overall, we are focused on driving our direct-to-consumer offers, while at the same time, deepening our relationships with key wholesale partners. We continue to make early progress towards building a demand and data-driven operating model that connects the planning, buying and selling of inventory much closer to demand. In the quarter, we executed excellent on-time delivery performance, shortening transit and production lead times and improving forecasting and buying. We are getting closer to the consumer with a more responsive replenishment model that ensures that we are never out of stock on core essentials and hero products already in Q1 driving significant comp increases in many of those products. As we're investing to fuel growth, we also remain focused on driving cost efficiencies and improving our overall cost competitiveness. We continue to make progress to align our organization to the PVH+ plan through the cost actions we have shared previously. Next, I'll share some highlights that demonstrate how we are connecting our brands with the consumer and driving brand desirability around the world. Starting with Calvin Klein. We generated some of the highest consumer engagement in the history of the brand, driven by the most impactful version of our Calvins or Nothing campaign to date. The campaign on its own had incredible impact. 1.7 billion impressions across PR and social media. The brand trended for multiple days on Twitter and expanded its social following with 1.6 million new followers, and we saw significant increases in traffic to our owned and operated e-commerce sites. This highly successful campaign was developed around our core principles of creating cut-through campaigns igniting our influencer engine and elevating the brand across every consumer touch point. We expanded our already strong brand ambassador group for the spring campaign, which included Kendall Jenner, Michael B. Jordan, Jennie Kim and the introduction of Jungkook, who is a massive K-Pop star. When we last spoke, Calvin had just announced John Cook as brand ambassador. Consumer reaction has been incredibly strong globally with a plus 39% increase in site visits across all regions and a visible lift in sales, which were up 150% compared to the weeks prior to launch. In China, the denim shirt he wore sold out on Tmall in just 30 minutes. We also had the highest reaching post of all times of social with our campaign video on Instagram generating 21 million in reach. The brand also recently launched Jenny for Calvin Klein. A unique limited edition capsule collection, designing partnership with Jennie Kim of Blackpink. The collection is focused on Jennie's personal take on hero products and Style Essentials in denim, underwear and other key categories. Together with the cut-through campaign that ran globally, it's generated nearly 700 million social media impressions, along with key products that sold out within 2 days of release, and we grew our consumer base with 65% of consumers being new to the brand. For Tommy, with its unique DNA of classic American cool, the brand continues to drive strong visibility and relevance among target consumers, generating approximately $5.5 billion impressions and 56 million social engagements globally during the quarter. Our classics reborn Spring campaign celebrates the brand's style icons made relevant for today and it's really cutting through with consumers. Across APAC, for example, our collaboration with Pop culture sensation and Singer, Henry Lau, helped drive Polo shirt sales up 68% year-over-year during the campaign period. Our collaboration with Shawn Mendes continue to drive brand heat globally. Personal appearances by Tommy Hilfiger and Shawn Mendes in London, Berlin, Milan, Mexico City resulted in huge crowds, day long lines at the stores and an elevated consumer experience. For summer, we are focused on high visibility collaborations to celebrate key consumer moments as part of our long-term partnership with the Mercedes-AMG Formula 1 team, the brand co-created a capsule collection ahead of the Formula 1, Miami Grand Prix in collaboration with Awake New York. The collection combined Awake Street style sensibility with Tommy's Signature prep aesthetic. The campaign featured talent like Lewis Hamilton, George Russell and Mick Schumacher and was amplified by multiple aspirational influencers. The capsule was 1 of the best performing of the year with a 62% sell-through in the first week. We are also excited to share the news about our upcoming collaboration with Disney. Connecting Disney's iconic characters into the world of Tommy Prep. We are thrilled to be part of Disney's 100th year milestone anniversary and look forward to celebrating with consumers worldwide, with a special focus on Asia. Now turning to our regional performance and how we are connecting our brands and executing the PVH+ plan across each region, starting with Europe. We continue to fuel our strength and delivered mid-single-digit year-over-year growth for the first quarter in euros, adjusted for our Russia exit on a significantly bigger business than pre-pandemic, a testament to our team's execution in the face of a continued challenging macro backdrop. We are further strengthening brand desire and our leading brand positioning in Europe for both Tommy and Calvin through hero products and cut-through campaigns. For Tommy, our 1985 program now represents over 25% of the total Tommy men's apparel business, up 70% year-over-year. We're driving strong sell-throughs and higher AURs in key categories such as polos, shirts and sneakers, and remain focused on expanding our strength in outerwear. At the same time, we continue to grow Calvin through building out and commercializing our hero product franchises in underwear and other key lifestyle categories, which are delivering higher AURs and double-digit growth. When we look at our forward wholesale order book, adjusting for Russia, and improved delivery performance compared to last year's supply chain disruptions, we continue to expect our shipped order book for fall to be up low single digits. And as we have mentioned before, we are well positioned to capitalize on stronger demand through our never out-of-stock programs. Looking ahead, we will intensify our execution of the PVH+ plan to continue to further strengthen our market position in the region. Moving on to Asia Pacific. We delivered a very strong start of the year by leaning into our hero product strategy and connecting our brands to impactful and regionally relevant talent. Our execution drove more than 25% revenue growth on a constant currency basis with strong growth across all countries, including China, which was up more than 40% in local currency as COVID restrictions lifted and our consumers came back strong. We also saw continued strength in Japan, Korea and Australia. We continue to amplify hero products and excite with newness to drive key category growth. In the first quarter, our hero product again outperformed with higher AURs and expanding gross margins. We continue to strengthen our brand awareness and build desire through cultural icons such as Jennie Kim and Jungkook, as I mentioned earlier. Our brands have premium product positioning in the region, and we see a clear opportunity to grow further across all markets. We continue to make strategic investments to increase overall brand awareness, especially in China, where both Calvin and Tommy are underpenetrated. We are creating a consistent and seamless experience no matter where the consumer shops in the marketplace with the largest growth opportunity being in digital. We launched on Douyin last year to cover even wider audiences across China, and we are now continuing to expand our digital footprint by launching on the rapidly growing DouYu platform, targeting Gen Z consumers in top tier cities. Looking ahead, following a successful Labor Day and International Women's Day in the first quarter, we are now gearing up for a strong 6/18 and Chinese Valentines Day, with each of these events supported by unique product capsules. Turning to our business in North America. We continue to make great progress in building the foundation for sustainable, increasingly profitable and brand accretive growth. We are winning more with the domestic consumer and getting good traction from our execution, leading to outsized growth in our direct-to-consumer business. We drove double-digit comps in D2C stores and e-commerce, and we improved our ability to match inventory to demand. Let me share some exciting proof points. For Tommy in Q1, we drove 25% year-over-year increases in key categories such as knits, sweaters and wovens. Global best sellers now represent approximately 85% of our assortment, up from 35% last year. Polos were once again the #1 category with higher AURs as we are elevating these key essentials. Similarly for Calvin, across channels, we are better matching key hero products with elevated marketing content, and we had stronger-than-expected performance in D2C e-commerce. For both Tommy and Calvin in North America, we're starting to significantly improve how we plan and allocate our inventory. Leveraging advanced analytics to ensure that the right product goes to the right stores at the right time to drive better availability and margin expansion. Beyond D2C, we also drove progress with key wholesale partners in the quarter, working very closely to improve Calvin and Tommy's presentation in top stores and drive consumer demand by sharpening our category offense and leaning into our hero products. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant opportunity to unlock our full potential in the North America region. In closing, across the company, we continue to take big steps in our disciplined execution of the PVH+ plan. With a strong focus on all that is within our control, I feel very confident that we will continue to deliver further building on the traction we have across both brands and all regions while successfully navigating the choppy macro. Last quarter, I highlighted the strength we are building in the leadership team and how I see talent as the key driver of the PVH+ plan. And just last month, we brought together our top 160 global leaders in New York to share progress, proof points and learnings from the first year of our PVH+ execution under the theme of Dream and Deliver. It was so powerful to see our top leaders together, not only being fully united and committed to our vision, but also being clear on how to achieve it, and seeing so many of them sharing on stage many examples of what successful execution looks like. As I continue to travel extensively with our teams in the markets globally, what's crystal clear to me is that no matter where in the world I go, there is incredible strength and untapped growth potential for both Calvin and Tommy. I often start my meetings with our team sharing my perspective that over 90% of our potential is still ahead of us. And I want to thank all our teams globally for being so engaged and so committed to go after it, executing another strong quarter together where we keep building on the momentum. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Zac to discuss the financials in more detail.Zachary James CoughlinThanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our strong results for the first quarter, which exceeded our top line guidance by 2% and delivering constant currency revenue growth of 5% versus last year and significantly exceeding our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $2.14. We are building a track record of strong performance delivering yet another quarter with top and bottom line results above guidance as we fought hard to win in the challenging macro environment. Looking forward, following our strong first quarter, we are reaffirming our full year revenue and EPS outlook. We are continuing to build momentum in the execution of the PVH+ plan with our first half outlook in line with plan. And at the same time, we acknowledge that macroeconomic uncertainties still exist with the consumer sentiment tempered by inflationary concerns. As such, we continue to plan for 2023 with a healthy balance of optimism and prudence. I will now discuss our first quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Our constant currency revenue growth of 5% in the first quarter was driven by both our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. On a reported basis, revenue was up 2% for the quarter, which reflected a 3% negative impact from exchange. Starting from a regional perspective, first quarter revenue for our international businesses was up a strong 9% on a constant currency basis. Within our International business, strong consumer demand and cut through marketing campaigns drove outstanding results across the Asia Pacific region. Revenues for Asia Pacific were up 18% on a reported basis including an 8% negative impact of exchange. And China was a particular bright spot with 44% growth in local currency, following the lifting of COVID restrictions in the fourth quarter. Revenue in our European business was up mid-single digits in euros, excluding the negative impact from the Russia exit in 2022. This was in line with expectations and building on top of a very strong first quarter in 2022. Overall, excluding Russia, our European business in the first quarter was 35% larger than in the same period in 2019 in euros. In North America, our focus has been on driving growth in the direct-to-consumer business and we delivered 14% growth in DTC for the quarter, with strong performance in both our retail stores and our owned and operated digital commerce business. And importantly, driven by improvement in sales to domestic consumers compared to the prior year. Wholesale sales in the region were down as planned, primarily in our Calvin Klein business, as retailers continue to take a cautious approach due to the elevated levels of inventory industry-wide. From a channel perspective, we continue to focus on driving performance in our direct-to-consumer business where we have the closest connection to our consumer and can deliver the PVH+ plan with greatest impact, and we delivered strong growth in both our stores and our owned and operated digital commerce business for the quarter. Our DTC revenue was up 12% on a constant currency basis, reflecting double-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and North America at up approximately 250 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue compared to last year as we accelerate our DTC growth in line with our PVH+ plan strategies. On a reported basis, DTC revenue was up 8%, which reflected a 4% negative impact from exchange. Our global brands also continued to deliver solid growth. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 8% on a constant currency basis, and Calvin Klein revenues were up 3% on a constant currency basis. with Calvin Klein more reliant on wholesale in the U.S. As Stefan described in depth earlier, our successful cut-through marketing campaigns and collaborations fueled growth in both brands this quarter. With the Shawn Mendes collaboration driving strong demand for Tommy Hilfiger. And in Calvin Klein, the highly successful Calvin's or Nothing campaign together with Jennie Kim, Jungkook and other strong ambassadors driving incredible brand engagement and demand. Reported revenues were up 5% for Tommy Hilfiger and flat for Calvin Klein. In the first quarter, we delivered gross margin of 57.9%, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to last year despite a 150 basis point negative impact on product costs due to exchange. Gross margin reflects a significant favorable shift in mix with our higher-margin DTC and international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue. Additionally, freight costs were down, as we use less air freight due to our supply chain having fully recovered back to pre-pandemic on-time delivery rates and transit times. Price increases were more than offset by higher product costs, including the negative impact exchange previously mentioned and the full impact of abnormally high raw material costs. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the first quarter was 48.7%, and lower than expected largely due to timing of expenses shifting from first to second quarter. The slight 30 basis points increase versus last year is more than explained by the shift in mix towards our DTC and international businesses. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments in strategic areas to fuel growth.In total, EBIT for the quarter was $199 million, exceeding our expectations due to strong revenue performance and lower expenses. Operating margin was 9.2%, which included the 150 basis point negative impact of exchange on our gross margin. Earnings per share increased 10% to $2.14 compared to $1.94 in last year's first quarter and exceeding our guidance by $0.24, largely driven by improvement in EBIT with about half of that beat due to timing differences between the first and second quarters.Earnings per share for the quarter also included an $0.11 negative impact compared to the prior year related to exchange translation. Our tax rate was approximately 23%. In line with previous discussions, our inventory levels continue to sequentially improve, and we now expect to have inventory and sales fully aligned by the end of the second quarter. Overall inventory was up 24% at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year period with sequential improvements in all regions.As we've discussed previously, inventory levels were abnormally low in the first quarter last year due to supply chain and logistic disruptions. The supply chain is now fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels with on-time deliveries back over 98% in all regions. Our inventory at quarter end reflects those earlier receipts of inventory along with the full impact of higher product costs compared to last year.We continue to work relentlessly to drive results. Our strong first quarter performance is a testament to the power of our 2 global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and our ability to navigate this volatile macro environment.And now moving on to our outlook. For the full year, we are confidently reaffirming our guidance on all dimensions. Revenue is projected to increase 3% to 4% as reported and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis, along with our operating margin outlook of 10% and our EPS projection of approximately $10 per share.Regionally, our outlook remains unchanged as well, as our overall first half plan is in line with our initial projections. Europe in euros and North America are both planned to grow low single digits, with strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel, tempered by wholesale revenue as retailers remain cautious on orders especially in the U.S.We expect our strong performance in Asia Pacific to continue with growth in the region planned up low double digits. This reflects broad-based growth across the region led by China, where easing of COVID restrictions has led to a strong rebound in demand for both brands. Additionally, we expect strong growth in other key markets as our product strategy and cut through marketing campaigns are driving demand across the region.We continue to expect our full year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022 despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange. The improvement in our gross margin reflects an approximately 100 basis point benefit from a favorable shift in channel and regional mix as we continue to drive growth in our higher-margin DTC business, in line with our PVH+ planned strategies, and our DTC and international businesses make up a larger portion of total revenue.And we expect to deliver approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to lower freight costs, a combination of both significantly lower air freight spend and a material decrease in ocean freight rates, both of which are an outcome of the significant improvements we've driven in stabilizing our supply chain, which is now performing back at pre-pandemic levels. We expect gross margin improvement to grow and impact each quarter through this year.We continue to expect that SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year will increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022, with our investments in DTC and mix of international business driving higher expenses. Additionally, we are investing in key areas that drive growth with a focus on increased levels of marketing beginning in the second quarter with our full year targeted at approximately 6% of revenue for the year compared to approximately 5.5% last year. We continue to drive cost efficiencies across the business and evolve our ways of working.We are making progress in our plans to implement the people cost actions we have shared previously and aim to achieve our targeted 10% people cost reduction in our global offices by the end of the third quarter. Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 10% and reflects high single-digit EBITDA growth. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $100 million and our tax rate for the year is estimated at approximately 24%. For the full year 2023, we continue to project earnings per share to be approximately $10, up 11% compared to 2022.Turning to the second quarter. Our overall revenue is in line with original plans and is projected to increase low single digits on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The PVH+ plan is driving growth by delivering the best-selling hero products that drive brand desirability, cut through marketing campaigns that drive strong consumer engagement and elevate the consumer experience and strong performance in our DTC businesses.Second quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $1.70. As our PVH+ plan execution builds momentum, we are planning higher second quarter SG&amp;A investments with a particular focus on marketing, where our spend is planned to increase by over 20% versus last year as we invest in cut through brand campaigns that ignite our talented influencer engine globally and elevate the brands across consumer touch points, building momentum heading into the second half of the year.Our tax rate for the second quarter is estimated at approximately 26% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $25 million. Before we open up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with another strong quarter to start the year. We are confident in the business and our ability to win in a challenging environment and committed to driving top line growth improved profitability and strong double-digit EPS growth in 2023.And with that, operator, we would like to open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulI guess just trying to keep at a high level today with you guys, but you had a really solid first quarter, making a lot of progress against the PVH+ plan. but you're not raising your guidance for the year. I'm just wondering if you could just maybe walk us through the dynamics on really where you think the business is? And when you look at the expectations that you had going into the year, any of the dynamics that you see, how you think about the numbers from this perspective, that would be helpful.Stefan LarssonBob. Let me start answering your question by sharing why I feel so good about our beat in the first quarter. So if you look at both Tommy and Calvin, we are winning with product. We are winning with the consumer engagement, and we are winning in the marketplace execution, and we do that across our 3 regions. And we do it in an increasingly systematic and repeatable way through the PVH+ execution. So the best way to describe this, what this really means is starting with the cut-through campaign.For both Calvin and Tommy, we are in a very systematic way, driving consumer engagement through cut-through campaigns that are amplified by our influence ranges. So for Calvin, it's within the cut-through campaign under the Calvins or Nothing umbrella generated -- this quarter generated some of the strongest consumer engagement in the history of the brand. So I mentioned Jennie Kim, Jungkook, Michael B Jordan, Kendall Jenner. So just this campaign alone during the quarter drove 1.7 billion impressions globally and 1.6 million new followers on the brand's social media platforms.And then we look at Tommy. Tommy come to market through and drive engagement through Tommy's Classics reborn campaign. And during the quarter, the brand generated -- Tommy generated 5.5 billion impressions at 56 million in social engagement during the whole quarter, amplified by talent like Shawn Mendes. But also through long-term collaborations, the brand has had for many years, but we amplify those differently now through the talent and the influencers.So the Mercedes Benz Formula 1 collaboration in the most recent race in Miami, we really amplified it with talent, with a collaboration. So you start to look at why we drive this strong performance despite the choppy macro the strength of the brands come to life through these strong campaigns. Then these campaigns, they play into a very strong product category offers. So in Calvin, that means underwear, shirts, denim, pants, outerwear. In Tommy, it means polos, shirts, khakis, sneakers, also outerwear.So we have the campaigns play into the biggest and most important product categories for the consumer. And that's where we focus and that's where we play to win. Within those categories, we build hero products. So one example in Tommy, is the 1985 program, double-digit growth, Calvin's modern cotton program, double-digit growth.So you start to see the campaign connects to the category offense connects to the hero products. And then it connects to most importantly -- it connects to how we execute in the marketplace. So where you see that we have the most control of the execution is direct-to-consumer. We drove double-digit direct-to-consumer growth for both brands, both stores and e-commerce.So this is how it all ties together, and this is why we have the confidence in looking for the rest of the year, we will just continue to gain traction. Then in addition to this, we are building the strength in the underlying business engine. So the demand-driven supply chain, we are really starting to get traction. We are back on better than pre-pandemic supply chain operations 101. We start to be able to shorten our lead times. We start to buy closer to demand. We replenish our key essentials in a much faster way. And then to Zac's point on the investment, we start to target investing in these growth drivers that I just went through. So marketing increasing from 5% to 6% of sales and then we drive our efficiency.So look at it as the PVH+ plan comes to life consumer-facing and the underlying business engines and in a very systematic, repeatable way. So coming back to the specifics of your question, in a normal year, Bob, with all this traction, we would have most likely flown this through, because we keep gaining this traction all across the company.And I just having done this a few times, as I mentioned, I know when that inflection point happens when you start to see traction just building. But at the same time, we are prudent. We are in it for the long-term value creation for shareholders, and we recognize we're in a choppy macro. So that's why we decided to -- even though we beat and why we beat its systematic and repeatable and we see it continue, we recognize the choppy macro, and we decide to reaffirm the guidance.OperatorOur next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleStefan, I want to follow up on your comments on supply chain. It sounds like the supply chain is really starting to operate back to pre-pandemic levels and some of the changes that you've been implementing are starting to happen. What kind of visibility do you have into seeing the company supply chain really evolved to the point where it can be fully delivering the kind of results that you want to really maximize the PVH+ plan and to get it to where you want to be it? And how long do you think it will take to get there now that the supply chains are sort of back to normal?Stefan LarssonThank you, Jay. It's a really important question around a really important value driver that I would say right now, we're in the early innings of unlocking a demand-driven -- building a demand-driven supply chain. So having David Sävman with his H&amp;M experience come in and help spearhead this with our leaders across our brands, across our regions, within supply chain. We're seeing right now much better visibility to what this could look like. So let me give you a few examples.So on-time delivery, we had supply chain-related issues coming out of COVID, we are now in a better place than what we were before COVID. So we are able to start to cut production lead times and cut delivery lead times, and we are doing that right now. And that also in parallel to that, we're able to better improve our forecasting and buying closer to demand.So over time, you will hear us lay out how we see that we will be able to run with much lower inventory levels in relation to sales than a traditional company in our sector. So -- but early days still, but this is going to be a multiyear unlock, but it's big.Zachary James CoughlinYes. And I think from a financial perspective, we're already beginning to see some of that payoff. Airfreight has now gone to practically 0 because of that level of certainty. We just finished negotiations on second half ocean freight rates, and they're down greater than 50%. And I think what we're really excited about and lastly and probably most impactfully over time is the beginnings of that impact on product cost.So finally, in holiday '23, we're starting to see both the combination of a raw materials market that's moving in our favor as well as some of the supply chain initiatives that Stefan was talking about starting to move product costs down. And that becomes increasingly impactful as you move into '24 as we're working on spring '24 product costs right now. So again, it's not -- it's been to show up tangibly in the financial performance as well.Stefan LarssonAnd is a mindset shift, Jay, that we are driving across the company. When we have now set out our vision to build cabinet Tommy into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world that make PVH one of the highest performing branders in the sector, we are changing the mindset. So historically, if we were to see that to Zach's point the macro cost in affecting our cost of goods is going down with X percent, that would be what we would do.Now we say it's going to go down with X percent plus the improvements we are driving given that we are going to execute better than the macro. So you will see, over time, you will increasingly see how we do something plus them stepping up because that's the power of the vision now and the power of the PVH+ plan that we have set out to become 1 of the highest performing branders in the sector. And we have a leadership team and leaders across the company that very much shares that mindset now.OperatorOur next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.Irwin Bernard BoruchowZach, maybe just some commentary a little bit more on the underlying success that's driving the cost efficiencies in the business model. And then if I got a little bit more specific based on the SG&amp;A, that's a little lumpy in Q2. If the brand investment that you guys are making is driving engagement and future sales and customer growth, do you guys think that you would potentially add more advertising in the back half if it makes sense to you? Just trying to think about how you're weighing the pros and cons of investment in ad spend right now.Stefan LarssonSo Ike this is Stefan, and then I'll hand over to Zac, but just on the highest level, the way we drive cost efficiency is that I see from leading the whole company is the power of the vision and the power of the focus on PVH+ makes it a very clear filter to make decisions around cost and investment. Is it driving 1 of the 5 value drivers or not?And again, being a big company, having been in business for a long time, there is a lot of cost that doesn't necessarily connect into driving towards the vision of driving PVH+. And that's where Zac and the finance team is doing a really good job, again, shifting mindset and asking those questions. And one of the key ways we drive efficiencies is to, first, to connect all investment and cost decisions to the PVH+, but also aligning how we work aligning our organization with the execution of the PVH+.Zachary James CoughlinYes, absolutely. I think in the first quarter, SG&amp;A looked up 30 basis points. But if you take out the increased DTC penetration and the outsized growth in our international markets, especially Asia, which we know come with heavier SG&amp;A. We continue to deliver SG&amp;A efficiency of over 100 basis points again. So that work we've started in the back end of the year, that continues.As Stefan mentioned, the core element thus far has really been aligning all spending to the PVH+ plan drivers, which on a surface sounds simple. But in reality, we are a company that's been built together over the years of the acquisition and the opportunity to rewire ways of working to operate under a single strategy and a single vision of working itself is driving efficiencies out from there and then we come in with the more structural things that we know that we're talking about.But we're really excited, though, to your point on investment in marketing in the second quarter, and I think is a sign of our confidence in how the year is shaping up. We are going to be spending more on marketing, 20% more in the second quarter than last year. Stefan talked already a lot about this is coming through in ways that are -- it's not just spending for spending.These are increasingly visible impactful campaigns that the consumers are seeing and feeling. And we do expect to maintain those increasing level of investments through the rest of the year. And I think that is -- if anything, a sign of our confidence as we're looking forward to the businesses, we know that's going to drive the outcomes that we're looking for.And then we will see underpinning that for the next middle part of the year, those investments are going to be coming in. And that's where we see a little bit of deleverage in the second quarter. By the end of the year, though, in the fourth quarter, we'll really start to see some of the impacts of some of the broader structural changes that we've talked about previously coming through. And sort of the rebalancing of that. But for right now, we are happy to be continuing that investment in the marketing, and we'll do so. So we've seen the results so far throughout this year.OperatorYour next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about North America, where you've brought customers back for each brand, what do you see as the path forward and the opportunity, where you are now versus where it was in the peak and where you can go? How do you see both on the top line and margin opportunity for the brand?Stefan LarssonWell, Dana, and this quarter was a great proof point -- not a great proof point for how we are winning more with the domestic consumer in North America because, as you all have heard us sharing is pre-pandemic, we were over-reliant on the international traveler, and we are really leaning into tapping into the full potential of driving brand accretive growth in North America.So starting with Tommy -- and -- or I can take both Tommy and Calvin, you see it already now in double-digit growth in D2C in a very tough, choppy market. And so we are executing the PVH+ plan. We are executing better category offense, better hero products, better consumer engagement and better marketplace execution across the channels. So what you will see step by step is how we continue to build on that strength in both Calvin and Tommy. And it's really just the beginning. And then it's going to be increasingly profitable and it's going to be brand accretive.Zachary James CoughlinYes. And I think if you think about it from a numbers perspective, focusing specifically as Stefan said, on DTC, where we can control our story and that connection with the consumer best, and we saw significant increases in revenue across both brands and across both channels for the year -- for the quarter, so landing mid-teens growth in what Stefan had said is by no means an easy environment out there in that regard. So I think it's showing up as well in the numbers that we're generating in the places that we get the chance to touch our consumers most closely.Stefan LarssonAnd Dana, just also connecting it back to I'm going to be very consistent in coming back to the biggest value driver to make the PVH+ come to life is talent. So if you look at talent for Calvin in globally and North America. So globally, we have Eva in seat now with her tremendous Inditex experience really starting to drive strength in products, strength in marketing, very strong marketing, Jonathan, our CMO, in Calvin, together with Eva under her leadership.We have Donald Kohler, president for Calvin Klein in North America with extensive Burberry turnaround experience that are very similar to what we are doing in terms of like unlocking brand accretive growth in the North American market. So Eva, Donald, Jonathan and the whole team under them really coming together around building brand accretive growth with the domestic consumer.So early days, but also in Tommy, very excited to see Emma, who's leading our D2C business in Tommy North America, Oregon leading our wholesale business. Just very across both Calvin and Tommy and both teams, we see how we are very consistent in finding ways to strengthen product quarter-by-quarter, strengthen consumer engagement and then strengthen the D2C offers and strengthen our key wholesale partnerships, being very mindful of looking at our wholesale partnership as our best full price expression of the brand as well. We have now time for 1 more question.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Kearney with BarclaysPaul David KearneyJust with some of the kind of weakness that we're seeing with North America wholesale, do you kind of view the current market as an opportunity to maybe accelerate parts of your PVH+ plan, whether it's further pull -- or change your mix towards EPC? Or conversely, are there parts of the PVH+ plan that maybe need to be pushed off a little bit.Stefan LarssonPaul. So what we are really pleased with, as we're shared earlier on the call as well is that the PVH+ execution is gaining traction all across the company. And where we have most of the control of execution is in D2C. So that's where you see both Calvin and Tommy really stepping up. And on the wholesale side, we see that our partners take more of a cautious outlook and we are adjusting to that as well. But we are really leading into D2C.And then in parallel, we are leaning in with our key wholesale partners, as I mentioned, because it's -- we see big upside in further improving our category offense, further improving our hero products, further improving our presentation, further improving our inventory behind those and do that together with our key partners.So it's -- overall, our distribution strategy remains the same, which is to follow the consumer. And in this past quarter and right now, the consumer is resonating with the strength in the D2C execution and also in wholesale, but again, in wholesale, more of a cautious outlook.Zachary James CoughlinYes. I think from an investment perspective, we're full steam ahead, right? You take a look at focusing on those channels that we can have the most close connection to consumers. So investing in owned stores renovation, which we've talked about.So no slowing down on that, investing in elevating e-commerce across all of the small and larger things that make that the best expression of the brand, investing in those marketing campaigns that allow us to connect directly with the consumers. Again, the year is, for us, is shaping up exactly as we were expecting it to. And so no slowdown from an investment perspective as we push into the rest of the year.Stefan LarssonAnd just as we close, I want to just reiterate that it's how we beat Q1 that excites us the most, that we are continuing to gain traction on the PVH+ plan. We are early on a multiyear journey to drive Calvin and Tommy towards the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and make PVH one of the highest performing brand groups. And we are having heads down working on that, and we look forward to continuing to share updates next quarter.Zachary James CoughlinAbsolutely.Stefan LarssonThank you very much.OperatorThis concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.]"

But that changed as more banking tools shifted online.Originally published on U.S. Bank company blogAbby Losordo started her career at U.S. Bank five years ago as one of the original accessibility consultants.Since then, Losordo has been instrumental in developing the U.S. Bank accessibility program (commonly abbreviated as ""A11Y"") and building a strong collaboration model with her peers, director and the bank's Experience Design team.Today, she leads a team of some 15 consultants, spanning the consumer segment, who help ensure that the U.S. Bank Mobile App and other digital banking tools are accessible to all users, including those who need assistive technology.Designers creating a digital product may not always be aware of potential roadblocks - such as color contrast not being high enough or pictures conveying meaning and don't have alternative text - so screen-reader users have access to the information. That is where the Design Accessibility team provides feedback to remedy those concerns early in the process.""A11Y consultants coach designers on how to design accessibly so our customers have a best-in-class experience,"" Losordo said.Losordo's journey into accessibility started when she was providing counseling and support to cancer patients navigating the thickets of the American healthcare system.After earning her master's degree in counseling psychology and her license in mental health counseling, Losordo focused on helping cancer patients remove barriers to their treatment - whether it was connecting people through complex medical systems, arranging transportation to daily radiation appointments or helping to secure insurance coverage.""My job was to ensure that my patients had access to all of the elements that are suddenly very important when you're going through a medical crisis,"" she said. ""It can sometimes be overwhelming to deal with all of that, and one of these barriers can sometimes be what prevents someone from getting treatment.""Story continuesAs a part of that work, Losordo consulted on the accessibility of many digital properties across the healthcare system and discovered that digital barriers exist in addition to the other common obstacles her patients encountered.When she joined U.S. Bank, digital accessibility was still an emerging concept in the financial services world. But that changed as more banking tools shifted online.In 2019, U.S. Bank unveiled an entirely rebuilt U.S. Bank Mobile App and has continued to add hundreds of new features ever since, and the digital accessibility team has been part of that journey the entire way.Today, there are consultants working on accessibility across the bank, and they are regarded as a world-class practice and model for other companies to follow.Earlier this year Deque gave the bank a Native Mobility Accessibility Award for its commitment to ensuring the U.S. Bank mobile app is easy for people with disabilities to use. U.S. Bank also ranked as a 2023 DiversityInc Top Company for people with disabilities.While Losordo's counseling background may be an unconventional path to her role, she has found it to be invaluable - especially in the area she is most enthusiastic about: managing her team.""My passion is growing people, shining a spotlight on them and their accomplishments, and helping them understand the strategy behind what we are doing and why we are doing it,"" she said. ""I love what I do so, so much. It is especially important to me that people find meaning in their work and they are happy here.""Be empowered to create your own path and accelerate your career by visiting the U.S. Bank career site.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758610/Meet-the-Former-Counselor-Helping-To-Bring-Digital-Accessibility-to-the-Bank]"

Walmart execs are preparing.CFO John David Rainey called the practice ""part of our normal planning process"" in a Q&amp;A during the shareholder's meeting, saying, ""We consider a range of possibilities, economic environment.""""We want to make sure that we are addressing not only the need to maximize revenue and profits but also looking at our balance sheet as well, making sure that we have access to capital at the lowest possible cost, which we did when we entered the market earlier this year,"" he added.Why the concern? ""Consumer wallets are squeezed and that's affecting...what they're purchasing,"" said Rainey.Price-cutting: CEO Doug McMillon told shareholders that some relief may be on the way for its customers. To keep ahead of the competition, Walmart aims to cut prices in an environment where mega companies have been accused of over-charging to jack up profits.Said the CEO: Walmart is ""trying to work hard right now, as we have been for quite some time now, with our suppliers to get our prices down."" McMillon was bullish, though: ""We think the company's positioned to succeed regardless of the environment.""So far so good. Compared to a year ago, Walmart stock is up more than 14%.Customer obsessed, tech obsessed: ""At the end of it, all, we are a tech company, but we are not a traditional tech company. We are here to solve real problems for real people,"" said Anshu Bhardwaj, Walmart's senior vice president of technology strategy and commercialization.AI, or artificial intelligence, is a big area of emphasis — and investment. Walmart, for instance, is testing a conversation platform, nicknamed ""Converse,"" to answer product-related questions on its website. In other words, a ""dedicated shopping assistant.""Story continuesFor example, a shopper can say, ""I'm interested in looking for a cell phone for a 10-year-old,"" then chatGPT will unveil four criteria when buying a cell phone for a 10-year-old, such as safety and parental controls. Then, once the shopper places the phone in its basket, the shopping assistant will ask if they also want a durable case.Converse was introduced back in 2020, but the world is more aware of it now thanks to ChatGPT, which Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart's EVP of new businesses and emerging tech, called a ""tipping point."" She added: ""The reason is it brought the ability to engage with the AI to anybody. You don't have to have a data science degree.""Bhardwaj said the question employees are asking is, ""How can I make my job easier [with AI] and apply that across the entire company?""Walmart's wholesale retailer Sam's Club uses the Converse tool for its AI digital assistant, ""Ask Sam,"" which allows employees to ask questions and translate languages, among other tools.No dice: There were nine shareholder proposals — they all failed. The proposals ranged from a ""Communist China Risk Audit"" and limiting contributions made by Walmart's PAC to requesting a ""Racial and Gender Layoff Diversity Report.""Walmart Executives Anshu Bhardwaj, Walmart's VP, Technology Strategy &amp; Commercialization (left) and Cheryl Ainoa, New Businesses and Emerging Tech EVP (right) break down how the company is using AI on the Walmart website. (Photo: Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance)Eyebrow-raising raises: The company's roughly 3,700 pharmacists will now have an average annual salary of $140,000 or so. This is on top of raises that took place last year. Based on Indeed data, the current professional average is approximately $118,081 per year. Walmart also raised pay for more than 4,000 opticians, with expectations for the average wage to be $22.50 an hour. No additional details were provided.Health: Walmart is heavily investing in its Health and Wellness business. By the end of 2024, Walmart will have more than 75 health centers in the US in states including Texas, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, and Florida.Walmart introduced new packaging, moving away from plastic mailers as it boosts itself as an omnichannel network. From left to right, Karisa Sprague, Walmart supply chain SVP, Jennifer McKeehan, Walmart end-to-end delivery SVP, and Jane Ewing, Walmart sustainability SVP. (Photo taken by Brooke DiPalma/Yahoo Finance)Going greener: Walmart is moving from plastic to recyclable paper mailers and using technology to get the size of cardboard packaging right. It is also giving customers the option to opt out of bags for pickup orders and the option to consolidate shipping orders, as Amazon (AMZN) does. However, unlike Amazon, there are no incentives, like credits, to encourage customers to make the ""sustainable"" choice.As a result of the switch, Walmart will eliminate over 2,000 tons of secondary plastic packaging and 65 million plastic bag mailers once the switch rolls out through the end of this fiscal year. The right size packaging is also expected to allow the company to put more boxes in trucks and thus reduce miles for shipping.Star-studded lineup: On Friday, Walmart wowed the crowd of shareholders and associates from Sam's Club, Walmart US, and Walmart International, including employees from China for the first time in four years, with quite a few A-list celebrities. Shania Twain kicked off the associate celebration, followed by host Kevin Hart. Other performers included John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Rachel Platten, and Pitbull. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans also made guest appearances, while Tom Cruise recorded a video for the event.Walmart by the numbers (Credit: Yahoo Finance, Source: Walmart)—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Shifting to the auto industry, EV maker Lucid's stock dropped after announcing a new stock offering. On the AI front, C3.ai shares plunged after the company issued a disappointing outlook.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Look at some of those individual movers. Well, Macy's closing the day slightly in the green, looking at gains of just about 1%, despite reporting results that did miss some expectations. The retailer also slashing its full year outlook amid growing concerns about the consumer.Dollar General shares sliding there on the day as they also lowered their full-year forecast for both sales and earnings. Earnings per share now projected to decline as much as 8% on the year. Looking at losses of just about 20%. So clearly, consumers pulling back here.But I also want to highlight what we saw play out with Nordstrom today because that was a bright spot in retail. And now it's very important to put this all in context. Clearly Nordstrom has been struggling now for quite some time. But when it comes to their results, they actually did relatively well. Shares closing up nearly about 5% today.And looking at these results here, better than expected first quarter earnings, held its full year outlook despite what some of those executives said with it being a very uncertain and challenging macroeconomic backdrop.- I think they're able to sort of better manage their inventory there. Their focused on a more of a higher end consumer. Maybe that has something to do with it as well. But I think it's more about that inventory management control.Also, the Nordstrom Rack business, focusing more on that, I know a lot of people, including my mom who are big fans of that business.SEANA SMITH: I'm one of them.- I mean, I shouldn't say me too as well. So I think they have the right kind of mix there for that for what's going to happen with the consumer down the line. Obviously, these lower-- lower low income names like Dollar General, Dollar Tree kind of hurting right now, as people go to Walmart and places like that so.Story continuesAlso, I'm thinking here watching Lucid stocks sliding today after the EV maker announced another stock offering worth $3 billion via private placement, an affiliate of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. Now, the Saudis already own 60% of the company before this move. So it wasn't that unexpected that they would raise money from them.And people had expected that they would probably need more money because they probably have I think enough money to go through 2023, 2024, as they ramp up their new vehicles, the Gravity SUV, things like that. So not surprising there.But I think for investors it's still a concern that these pure play non-legacy EV makers need so much cash to just keep going to compete with Tesla, compete with Ford and GM. It's going to be a long road ahead for them, but they have the right product.SEANA SMITH: Very long road ahead for them. And also the consensus out here on the Street that maybe this fundraising really reduces those expectations that Lucid could potentially go private at least in the near term. Morgan Stanley was out making some comments on the heels of this news, saying that the ability to access such a substantial amount of equity financing is unique.Also, provides just greater time in order for Lucid to really explore some of the changes to their business that they need to make. Also, their cash position strategy required to potentially keep moving forward.But you mentioned the fact that the company has been struggling so much. I think a lot of investors are just trying to figure out what exactly the future does look like here for Lucid.Let's also take a look at one of the AI movers on the move today. It's really been on the move here for this year. But C3 AI reported its fourth quarter earnings last night after the bell. And despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom line, shares plunged today as the company's full year revenue outlook came in shy of Wall Street's expectations.This comes after a massive, massive run off in the stock price since January 1st. But shares plunging their 2024 revenue forecast on the lighter side of what the Street was looking for. And that was enough to send shares down significantly lower today.- Yeah, we're just seeing today the stock up 250% this year alone. So any little chance investors could take to sell this stock after a huge run up, I think they took it, and they were able to kind of do that as your catalyst for that big downdraft there.I'm not an AI expert, but I feel like maybe there's more sort of juice behind the AI hardware plays like Nvidia and Marvell, as opposed to the software plays, which is sort of dominated by Google, Microsoft, and, of course, OpenAI, things like that. So I think maybe that's sort of what's going on here at play is more of a valuation, kind of, let's make take some money off the table right now.]"

Apple is expected to talk up the prospect of further integrating and monetizing AI.“[W]e are expecting Cook &amp; Co. to discuss Apple's AI strategy looking ahead and how the company can integrate and ultimately monetize its customer base around future generative AI coming from Cupertino,” Wedbush said in a note.Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), meanwhile, fell more than 4% after reporting quarterly that topped estimates, but signs of waning demand stoked worries about whether the software company would be able to meet guidance.“The debate post this 1Q/Apr print is about the top-line and whether Salesforce can hit a 10%+ revs growth target in FY24/FY25,” UBS said in a note.Story continuesElsewhere on the earnings front, Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) cut losses to close up 1% despite cutting its full-year outlook following quarterly revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates as margin growth was held back by a ramp-up in promotions.Nordstrom Inc (NYSE:JWN), however, reported a surprise quarterly profit, sending its shares nearly 5% higher.On the economic front, data continued to show the labor market remains strong as initial jobless claims rose, albeit by fewer than expected, while new jobs in the private sector for May topped estimates.The stronger labor market data come just a day ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday that is expected to show the U.S. created about 180,000 jobs last month.“Overall, upside risk to May payrolls comes from a higher than expected ADP print, still low initial and continued jobless claims, and an improvement in labor dynamics in the ISM Manufacturing Index,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow kicks off June on firm footing amid debt-ceiling progressAfter-hours movers: MongoDB, lululemon surge following results; SentinelOne, PagerDuty plungeFive Below reports Q1 EPS beat, shares gain 5%]"

This has outpaced the Finance sector's loss of 3.22% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.42% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Huntington Bancshares as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Huntington Bancshares to post earnings of $0.35 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 2.78%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.87 billion, up 6.55% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.44 per share and revenue of $7.53 billion.

Before then, OPEC ministers will meet at 11 a.m. on Saturday.The sources said cuts could amount to 1 million bpd on top of existing cuts of 2 million bpd and voluntary cuts of 1.6 million bpd that was announced in a surprise move in April.If approved, it would take the total volume of reductions to 4.66 million bpd, or around 4.5% of global demand. Earlier, two OPEC+ sources said they did not expect the group to agree further cuts.Western nations have accused OPEC of manipulating oil prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs.In return, OPEC officials and insiders have said the West's money-printing over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export.""We will never hesitate to take any decision to achieve more balance and stability (on) the global oil market,"" Iraq's Oil Minister Hayan Abdel-Ghani said on arriving in Vienna.The surprise output announcement in April helped to drive oil prices about $9 per barrel higher to above $87, but they swiftly retreated, under pressure from concerns about global economic growth and demand. On Friday, international benchmark Brent was trading around $76. [O/R]Last week, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz said investors who were shorting the oil price should ""watch out"", which many market watchers interpreted as a warning of additional supply cuts.Story continuesRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, however, subsequently said he did not expect any new steps from OPEC+ in Vienna, Russian media reported.The International Energy Agency expects global oil demand to rise further in the second half of 2023, potentially boosting oil prices.Analysts at JP Morgan, however, said OPEC had not acted quickly enough to adjust supply to high levels of U.S. fuel output.""Demand growth continues to be robust. Rather, there is simply too much supply... The alliance waited too long to reduce supply. The alliance - or at least some members - would likely need to cut more,"" analysts from JP Morgan said in a note.Rapidan Energy Group analysts put the chances of a further cut at 40%.""Ministers are determined to avoid a repeat of 2008, when a sudden collapse in global economic and financial stability sent crude prices from over $140 to $35 in six months,"" they wrote.(Reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar, Alex Lawler, Maha El Dahan, Julia Payne, Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Kirsten Donovan, Barbara Lewis and Marguerita Choy)]"

(AP) — Hundreds of square miles in New Mexico will be withdrawn from further oil and gas production for the next 20 years on the outskirts of Chaco Culture National Historical Park that tribal communities consider sacred, the Biden administration ordered Friday.The new order from Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland applies to public lands and associated mineral rights within a 10-mile (16-kilometer) radius of the park. It does not apply to entities that are privately, state- or tribal-owned. Existing leases won’t be impacted either.A World Heritage site, Chaco Culture National Historical Park is thought to be the center of what was once a hub of Indigenous civilization, with many tribes from the Southwest tracing their roots to the high desert outpost.After extensive studies and consultations, the plan has pitted the Navajo Nation against other tribes in the region amid concerns about economic impacts and that individual Navajo allotment owners may be left landlocked by restrictions on public land.“Today marks an important step in fulfilling President Biden’s commitments to Indian Country, by protecting Chaco Canyon, a sacred place that holds deep meaning for the Indigenous peoples whose ancestors have called this place home since time immemorial,” Haaland said in a statement. “I value and appreciate the many Tribal leaders, elected officials, and stakeholders who have persisted in their work to conserve this special area.”A recent assessment published by the Interior Department shows that the withdrawal will result in a few dozen wells not being drilled.The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association has argued that the plan would leave additional leases on Navajo land or allotments owned by individual Navajos landlocked by taking federal mineral holdings off the board.Navajo Nation officials have made similar arguments, saying millions of dollars in annual oil and gas revenues benefit the tribe and individual tribal members. The Navajo Nation completed its own study last year and advocated for a smaller area to be set aside given the economic impacts a withdrawal would have on the tribe.Story continuesOn Friday, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley expressed disappointment in the Interior Department's decision.“The Navajo Nation attempted to compromise by proposing a 5-mile buffer as opposed to the 10-mile,” Curley said. “The Biden Administration has undermined the position of the Navajo Nation with today’s action and impacted the livelihood of thousands of Navajo allotment owners and their families.”The Bureau of Land Management said the 10-mile (16-kilometer) radius would help protect more than 4,700 known archaeological sites outside the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, while a 5-mile (8-kilometer) radius would encompass about 2,800 of the sites.President Joe Biden initially proposed the ban in November 2021 at the White House Tribal Nations Summit. Since then, interviews, planning sessions and meetings with historic preservation experts and others have taken place.A coalition of environmental groups and Native American activists that campaigned for the restrictions applauded Friday's order as a good first step in protecting cultural sites and the region from pollution and climate change.“Full landscape management to phase out new and existing oil and gas development is a necessary next step,” said Julia Bernal, executive director of Pueblo Action Alliance.Federal officials have billed the Chaco initiative as a novel effort that could provide a roadmap and lessons learned for future collaborations with tribes.New Mexico’s congressional delegation reintroduced legislation last month that would formalize the same buffer around the park. It would span more than 490 square miles (1,269 square kilometers) of federal land.In addition to the approved withdrawal, Haaland — who is from Laguna Pueblo and is the first Native American to lead a Cabinet agency — has committed to taking a broader look at how federal land across the region can be better managed while taking into account environmental effects and cultural preservation.]"

The April reading was originally given as 127.2.The May score marked the lowest since April 2021 and meant the index was now 22% below an all-time peak reached in March 2022 following the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.FAO's cereal price index dropped by nearly 5% in May from the prior month, pressured by ample supply prospects and the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative allowing shipments from Ukraine.But international rice prices continued to increase in May, partly due to tighter supplies in some exporting countries, said FAO. The agency last month expressed concern over rising prices of the staple.FAO's vegetable oil price index slid almost 9% month on month, reflecting large oilseed supplies and weak demand for palm oil, while global dairy prices eased over 3% amid a seasonal upturn in northern hemisphere milk output, the agency said.Sugar prices, in contrast, showed a 5.5% increase from April in a fourth straight monthly gain, as concerns over the El Nino weather pattern added to global supply risks, FAO said.However, improving weather conditions in Brazil and lower crude oil prices have curbed sugar markets, it added. Sugar futures ended May lower after a 12-year high in late April.In a separate report on cereals supply and demand, FAO forecast world cereal production this year at 2.813 billion tonnes, a 1% increase from 2022 that mainly reflected an expected rise in maize output.Global cereal stocks in the 2023/24 season were projected to rise 1.7% year on year to a record 873 million tonnes, reflecting larger expected stocks of maize, rice and barley.Wheat stocks were forecast to fall, however, as production was seen declining while demand was expected to be stable.(Reporting by Gus Trompiz; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

The slowdown is largely due to a rapid rise in interest rates, economic uncertainty, and turmoil in the banking industry.Most major banks that advise on mergers or IPO underwriting reported drops in fee revenue during the first quarter. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman Sachs (GS), followed by a 25% drop at Citigroup (C) and a 20% drop at Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw investment banking revenue down 19%.Many of these banks decided to eliminate more positions this year, according to media reports. Cuts at Morgan Stanley (MS) will amount to roughly 3,000, and JPMorgan is culling roughly 500 positions. Citigroup and Bank of America are making smaller reductions of a few hundred jobs each.Goldman is planning for a total of $1 billion in expense cuts, including the new layoffs.John Waldron, Goldman's chief operating officer.

We might be surprised on the upside. We can always flex into that but we definitely have a much more cautious tone.”Story continuesWaldron cited muted activity with private equity firms and less activity with larger companies while pointing to middle-market merger activity as a bright spot.Trading “is more sluggish,” said Waldron who added that compared to the second quarter a year ago, Goldman’s market division should post 25% lower revenue. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan executives have also warned recently that their trading results would decline in the second quarter.“We've had a couple of good weeks of equity capital markets activity. So you could envision that we might have a better back half of the year. We're not necessarily planning for that, but it certainly could happen,” Waldron added.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

MS has been considering cutting around 7% of jobs in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts that the company announced earlier.Of the total cuts, China is likely to take the biggest hit, as slowing economic growth in the country is curbing deal-making. Last year, MS slashed roughly 50 IB jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with a large number being China-focused positions.  While the overall trading business performance has been decent, the performance of the company’s IB business was weak in the first quarter of 2023. A host of factors, such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession, acted as headwinds for mergers and acquisitions.Thus, deal volume and total deal value numbers crashed in the quarter. For the same reasons, IPOs, follow-up equity issuances and bond issuances dried up.Due to these headwinds, Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting fees decreased 22% year over year and fixed-income underwriting declined 6%. Advisory fees were down 32%. Therefore, total IB fees dipped 24% year over year.Notably, Saperstein, who leads the company’s wealth management unit, is a candidate to succeed CEO James Gorman after his retirement.Saperstein said that the wealth business is targeting to reach $12 billion in annual pretax profits over several years, and more than double its client assets under management to $10 trillion.Saperstein also said that the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) could transform the work of financial advisers who serve wealthy clients.He added, “We're continually looking for game-changing technology to integrate into our platform. One recent example of that approach to innovation is our partnership with open AI. That relationship began well over a year ago, before they were a household name.”Over the past six months, shares of MS have declined 11.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 17.5%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Competitive LandscapeMorgan Stanley is not the only one that is trimming its workforce amid the challenging economic environment. Wall Street firms, including Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C, have been taking similar steps in their IB and wealth management divisions.This March, Citigroup initiated a round of job cuts, slashing hundreds of jobs across the firm, which accounted for less than 1% of its total workforce. According to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified, the company’s IB division, its operations and technology organization, and the U.S. mortgage-underwriting division were among those affected.In its IB division, Citigroup was struggling because of the industry-wide slowdown in deal-making. In its mortgage division, the company was grappling with reduced mortgage demand because of rising prices and a rapid increase in mortgage rates.Similarly, in February, it was reported that Bank of America was planning to cut jobs in its investment bank. The cuts are expected to have affected less than 200 bankers globally.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(NYSE: FE), have requested a review of their base electric rates by the West Virginia Public Service Commission (PSC). The proposed $207 million adjustment supports investments that strengthen the energy grid, funds reliability programs targeting rural communities and establishes a team to support low-income customers.Mon Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)In addition, the filing requests recovery of costs associated with storm repairs, including multiple storms in December, depreciation changes for Mon Power's West Virginia generating plants and higher operating and maintenance costs associated with inflation.""While strict cost management and careful planning have allowed us to keep our West Virginia electric rates the lowest among the state's investor-owned electric companies, an adjustment is required to keep pace with rising prices and allow us to continue making critical electric system enhancements,"" said Jim Myers, president of FirstEnergy's West Virginia operations. ""Our proposal supports ongoing preventative maintenance and equipment enhancements that would reinforce the grid against progressively stronger storms.""The proposed rate review supports investments in the generation, transmission and distribution system, storm restoration work and a bill assistance initiative that aims to keep customers' needs and expectations top of mind. The rate proposal includes:Measures that support investments the companies have made to help create a more reliable and resilient electric system, including installation of new automated technology.An Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) to enhance reliability in rural areas by funding specific, targeted projects such the construction of tie lines to provide alternative sources of power as well as new substations and additional power lines.Creation of a new customer advocacy program to evaluate processes from the unique vantage point of the low-income customer that will help provide the companies with recommendations for process improvements.Story continuesMon Power and Potomac Edison have grown significantly in the nine years since its last base rate review, now serving approximately 550,000 customers in West Virginia – 25,000 more than it did in 2014. In addition, the companies have collectively invested more than $1 billion to improve and maintain the distribution, transmission and generation systems since the last rate review.If approved, Mon Power and Potomac Edison customers would continue to pay the lowest electric rates among West Virginia's investor-owned regulated electric companies. The average Mon Power or Potomac Edison residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month would see a 15% overall rate increase – or $18.07 monthly.The requested rate reviews are subject to PSC review. Any increase in rates would not become effective until approved and authorized by the Commission, which is expected to occur in March 2024.The public is invited to comment on the filing through the West Virginia PSC's public comment process, and the companies will participate in public meetings about the plan and engage key stakeholders to ensure an open and thorough review of the proposal.Investor Note: For additional information on the filing, visit the new ""Investor Materials"" section of the FirstEnergy website here.Mon Power serves about 395,000 customers in 34 West Virginia counties.

C3 has garnished Wall Streets’ attention as well with much optimism surrounding the enterprise AI software providers’ prospects.Let’s take a look at Salesforce and C3’s quarterly results along with their outlooks to see if now is a good time to buy.Salesforce Q1 Review Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated the company significantly exceeded its non-GAAP margin targets for the quarter and plans to lead the next major revolution in CRM to infuse trusted, secure generative AI across its entire portfolio.  Salesforce’s Q1 earnings came in 5% above EPS expectations at $1.69 per share. First-quarter earnings also climbed 72% from the prior-year quarter. On the top line, sales surpassed estimates by roughly 1% at $8.24 billion and rose 11% year over year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchC3 Q4 ReviewC3’s stock has been a large beneficiary of the recent AI mania with the company announcing its accelerated digital transformation software will be sold on a marketplace run by Amazon (AMZN) Web Services.Increased market demand for enterprise AI led to what the company stated was a substantial increase in opportunity and shorter sales cycles. Still, Wall Street and investors alike were a bit underwhelmed by C3's ability to capatilize on the AI frenzy.  C3’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings came in at -$0.13 per share and above estimates of -$0.17 a share. This was also up from an adjusted loss of -$0.21 a share in the prior-year quarter. Sales came to $72.41 million which slightly topped estimates and was virtually flat from a year ago.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth ProspectsBased on Zacks estimates, Salesforce earnings are now projected to soar 35% in its current fiscal 2024 to $7.11 per share compared to EPS of $5.24 in FY23. Even better, fiscal 2025 earnings are projected to climb another 23% at $8.77 per share. Total sales are now forecasted to be up 10% in FY24 and rise another 11% in FY25 to $38.49 billion.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to C3, an adjusted loss of -$0.33 per share is projected in its current fiscal 2024 and up from -$0.42 a share in FY23. C3 is projected to move closer to probability in FY25 with an adjusted loss of -$0.19 a share expected. Sales are forecasted to jump 19% in FY24 and rise another 15% in FY25 to $366.76 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineSalesforce and C3 stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following their quarterly results. There could be better buying opportunities ahead with C3 shares already soaring +207% YTD and Salesforce stock up +60%. With that being said, Salesforce's growth is very attractive and C3's outlook shows signs of promise as well.  Furthermore, the AI revolution appears to be upon us, and holding on to C3 and Salesforce stock could be rewarding going forward.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a notable development, company executives discussed artificial intelligence technology and its potential impact on the software business several times on the first-quarter earnings call, which makes Salesforce yet another tech giant that aims to benefit from the exponential growth in AI usage.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMToday, companies of every size are aggressively investing in AI on the back of the massive popularity this technology gained with the launch of ChatGPT late last year. Salesforce, as a global leader in its chosen niche, seems well positioned to benefit from the planned investments.The focus on profitability is paying offMany high-growth companies focus on maintaining stellar revenue growth, at times losing focus on profitability to the extent that margins deteriorate beyond repair. Salesforce, however, has avoided this pitfall by making the necessary adjustments to its business strategy to prioritize sustainable growth. A few quarters ago, CEO Marc Benioff said the company will explore avenues to expand operating margins and, by extension, profitability. The company has stayed true to this vision.In the first quarter, which ended on April 30, Salesforces operating margin expanded by 1,000 basis points year over year to 27.6%, well ahead of its target. For the fiscal year, the company raised its margin target to 28% and said operating margins of around 30% can be attained by fiscal 2025.To drive margins higher, the company plans to focus on areas where productivity can be improved. The pricing strategy will also be closely monitored to benefit from macroeconomic trends that enable the company to charge higher prices for its products and services. Salesforce is currently working with Bain &amp; Company to identify ways to improve the overall efficiency of the organization, and, according to Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver, the operational review has almost come to an end, setting the stage for the implementation phase in the coming months.Story continuesIn addition to operating margin expectations, Salesforce raised its earnings forecast for the full year as well. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share between $7.41 to $7.43 in comparison to its guidance for adjusted earnings of $7.12 to $7.14 last March. This meaningful increase in Salesforces profit forecast comes on the back of optimism surrounding its operating margin profile.The AI growth storySalesforce is accustomed to using AI technology to improve the experience of its customers. For years, the company has been investing in AI to integrate this technology into its product suite. For instance, Salesforce Einstein, an AI-powered platform that enables users to automate tasks and analyze data, is at the forefront of the company's AI strategy. Einstein can help businesses predict sales opportunities, proactively resolve cases even before they are reported, personalize the marketing strategy for a selected customer and create smart apps for both employees and customers. Einstein is currently available through different Salesforce products such as Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud.With many businesses now aware of the benefits associated with embracing AI-powered solutions, there is strong demand for software solutions that offer an automated, AI-integrated experience. Building on the recognition of Salesforce Einstein, the company is planning to launch Einstein GPT, the worlds first generative AI technology for customer relationship management. Customers will be able to improve their efficiency meaningfully with the help of the generative AI technology, which will generate emails, start conversations and create offers based on real-time data.Salesforce is aggressively investing in its AI capabilities to leverage the first-mover advantage it is enjoying in the field of AI-driven CRM solutions. Although these investments could exert pressure on the companys margin profile in the short run, it is doing the right thing by cutting costs where possible to funnel savings into AI investments.Salesforce is not cheaply valuedGrowth companies are seldom cheaply valued as investors attach premium valuation multiples for high-growth businesses in anticipation of stellar revenue and earnings growth. Salesforce, valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 31, is not cheaply valued today. However, at a time when the company is laser-focused on profitability, long-term-oriented investors might feel comfortable investing in Salesforce as it is in much better shape to convert growing revenue into a steady stream of earnings compared to a few years ago, when the strategy was to achieve growth at any price.TakeawaySalesforce shares fell following the first-quarter earnings release. The company, however, is exceeding the original operating margin targets announced at the end of the previous year. Growth-oriented investors with an above-average risk tolerance might want to make the most of the current pullback in the stock by doubling down at seemingly fair prices.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

58,d9ec2930-5ba3-38cd-b0af-ce9c88e7f430,FLS,2023-06-02,Here's Why You Should Give Emerson (EMR) Stock a Shot Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-emerson-emr-stock-165400078.html,1685552040,STORY,"['EMR', 'FLS', 'GGG']","[Emerson Electric Co. EMR is poised for growth on the back of healthy demand across end markets and improving supply chains. The company’s restructuring actions highlight its aim to become a pure-play global automation company to drive growth and profitability. EMR’s efforts to consistently reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks hold promise.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a good investment choice.End-Market Strength: Strong demand in the process and hybrid markets is boosting Emerson’s underlying orders (up 7% in the fiscal second quarter). The Intelligent Devices business unit is benefiting from underlying sales growth in the Americas region. Revenues from the unit increased 6% year over year in the first six months of fiscal 2023.Strength in the process end markets augurs well for EMR’s Software and Control business group. This, coupled with contribution from the AspenTech acquisition, drove segmental revenues by 30% year over year in the first six months of fiscal 2023.Emerson Electric Co. Price and Consensus Emerson Electric Co. Price and ConsensusEmerson Electric Co. price-consensus-chart | Emerson Electric Co. QuoteBullish Forecast: Given the strength across its end markets, Emerson has raised its fiscal 2023 guidance. For fiscal 2023, the company expects net sales to increase 9-10.5% compared with a rise of 8-10% anticipated earlier. Underlying sales are expected to increase 8.5-10% compared with 6.5-8.5% rise estimated earlier. Adjusted earnings are predicted to be between $4.15 and $4.25 compared with $4.00–$4.15 forecasted earlier.For the fiscal third quarter, EMR expects underlying sales to increase 10-12%. Net sales are predicted to increase 10.5-12.5% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be in the band of $1.07-$1.11 per share for the fiscal third quarter. The mid-point of the guided range — $1.09 — indicates an increase of 18% from the year-ago reported number.Inorganic Activities: Acquisitions have been Emerson's preferred mode of business expansion so far. The acquisition of Fluxa (July 2022) has enabled EMR to leverage the former’s PKM software, its DeltaV control system and life sciences automation software to provide customers with a comprehensive line of solutions for developing new drugs.In May 2022, Emerson merged its industrial software businesses, OSI Inc. and Geological Simulation Software, with Aspen Technology to create “AspenTech”. The merger, in which the company has majority ownership, enabled it to gain control over a high-valued pure-play industrial software leader, expedite its software strategy and realize substantial synergies.As part of its restructuring actions, Emerson has lately been aiming to divest non-core/non-profitable businesses. In November 2022, the company completed the divestment of its InSinkErator business to Whirlpool. The divestiture helps the company divert resources to key growth areas. In October 2022, the company divested its majority stake in its Climate Technologies business. The divestment allows the company to become a pure-play global automation company.Deal to Acquire National Instruments: Emerson’s move to acquire National Instruments in an $8.2 billion deal is aligned with its focus on global automation to drive growth and profitability. The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2024, will strengthen EMR’s global automation foothold, helping the company expand into high-growth end markets, including semiconductor and electronics, transportation and electric vehicles and aerospace and defense.Apart from expanding automation capabilities, the acquisition will open up industrial software opportunities for EMR. Emerson expects the transaction to generate cost savings of $165 million by the end of the fifth year upon completion. The buyout is expected to be immediately accretive to EMR’s adjusted earnings. The acquisition will also generate significant recurring revenues and improve EMR’s gross margins.Shareholder-Friendly Activities: Strong cash flows (free cash flow was up 23% in the first six months of fiscal 2023) allow Emerson to effectively deploy capital to make acquisitions, repurchase shares and pay out dividends. In October 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 1%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company completed its target to buyback $2 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2023.In the first six months of fiscal 2023, EMR paid dividends of $603 million. For 2023, the company expects to pay out dividends of approximately $1.2 billion. The company expects a free cash flow of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2023.Northbound Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Emerson’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 2.7% in the past 60 days.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Flowserve FLS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Growth across both North America and international operations and strength across institutional end markets are key growth drivers for the Food Equipment unit. Strength in the capital equipment business bodes well for the Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics segment. Solid industrial and oil and gas businesses augur well for the Welding segment.Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, Illinois Tool’s bullish guidance for 2023 holds promise. The company expects organic growth of 3-5% for the current year. For 2023, the company expects revenues to increase 2-4% year over year. ITW raised its earnings guidance to $9.45-$9.85 per share compared with $9.40-$9.80 anticipated earlier.Illinois Tool’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks also drove its shares higher. In August 2022, the company hiked its dividend by 7% to $1.31 per share. In the first quarter of 2023, the company bought back shares worth $375 million. In 2023, Illinois Tool expects to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of shares.Strong free cash flow generation capacity supports the company’s shareholder-friendly activities. Free cash flow of $615 million surged more than 100% year over year in the first quarter. The conversion rate to net income was 86%. Free cash flow is expected to be more than 100% of net income in 2023.Will the Uptrend in Shares Last?While supply chain issues persist, the situation has improved. This should aid Illinois Tool’s performance in 2023. Although the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, recent signs of an uptick in manufacturing activities bode well for all industrial companies, and ITW is no exception. An uptick in manufacturing activities is expected to translate into improved business volumes for ITW.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksIllinois Tool presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Ingersoll Rand IR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

63,d24edd91-132f-39d3-b461-3306cf79b979,NWS,2023-06-02,Does News Corp. (NWSA) Have the Potential to Rally 39.43% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-news-corp-nwsa-potential-135511508.html,1685627711.0,STORY,"['TGT', 'NWSA']","[News Corp. (NWSA) closed the last trading session at $18.31, gaining 7.5% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $25.53 indicates a 39.4% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises four short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $3.66. While the lowest estimate of $21.10 indicates a 15.2% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 63.8% to reach $30. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NWSA. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NWSAThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 18%, as two estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, NWSA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NWSA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ALGN) shareholders (or potential shareholders) will be happy to see that the Independent Director, Kevin Dallas, recently bought a whopping US$2.0m worth of stock, at a price of US$285. That increased their holding by a full 133%, which arguably implies the sort of confidence required for a shy sweet-natured nerd to ask the most popular kid in the school to go out on a date. View our latest analysis for Align Technology Align Technology Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President Joseph Hogan made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$189 each. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$297), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Align Technology insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The average buy price was around US$240. We don't deny that it is nice to see insiders buying stock in the company. However, we do note that they were buying at significantly lower prices than today's share price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Align Technology insiders own 4.1% of the company, worth about US$936m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Align Technology Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Align Technology. That's what I like to see! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Align Technology has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NYSE:MSI) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-solutions-inc-nyse-msi-125353120.html,1685624033,STORY,['MSI'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Motorola Solutions fair value estimate is US$234Current share price of US$282 suggests Motorola Solutions is potentially 20% overvalued The US$296 analyst price target for MSI is 26% more than our estimate of fair valueIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.70bUS$1.92bUS$2.01bUS$2.46bUS$2.66bUS$2.81bUS$2.94bUS$3.06bUS$3.16bUS$3.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.75%Est @ 4.66%Est @ 3.89%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$52bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$23bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$39b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$282, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Motorola Solutions as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.073. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Motorola SolutionsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Communications industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Motorola Solutions, we've put together three fundamental aspects you should further research:Risks: For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Motorola Solutions  that you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for MSI's future outlook?

Their CEOs are paid handsomely, though some are getting pay cuts. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, saw a huge dip in compensation, going from $212 million in 2021 to $1.3 million in 2022. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, brought in $84 million in 2022, however, he is expected to see a 40 percent drop in 2023. The Yahoo Finance Live team breaks down the numbers.Video Transcript- Tech stocks leading the way on Wall Street. And with the strength in the sector, we're taking a close look at the leaders of the trillion dollar names and their wealth. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley is here. Dan, what do you got?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So we have a big discussion going on, obviously, about trillion dollar companies because of NVIDIA crossing that line this week and falling back under it. But we want to kind of go over what the leaders of these companies bring home themselves as far as their compensation packages.So we'll just start it off with Alphabet's Sundar Pichai. In 2022, he made $225 million. There was a big uproar because they, obviously, were doing layoffs at that company. That included a salary of $2 million-- I'm going to have to renegotiate my salary here-- as well as stock awards of $218 million and then $6 million for security. If you've ever seen ""The Simpsons,"" I assume it's because he has dogs with bees in their mouths and when they bark, they shoot bees at you.Andy Jassy, meanwhile, he brought home $1.3 million. The founder of Amazon Jeff Bezos scoffing at that. That was made up of $317,000 in salary, $981,000 towards his 401(k) in security. The year before that, though, he made $212 million because $211 million came in stock awards. So a huge dip.Microsoft's Satya Nadella, meanwhile, he brought home $54.9 million, $2.5 million in salary, $42 million in stock awards, $10 million in cash incentives, and then $110,000 in charities in 401(k).And Tim Cook. This was a big one. He brought home $84 million in 2022. He's expecting a 40% drop, though, next year to get a $3 million salary, $6 million in cash, and $40 million equity award. And we can't leave out Jensen Huang. He is the CEO of NVIDIA, despite the fact that they fell down below the mark. He last year made a salary of $996,000, $19.6 million stock award, and $693,000 towards his 401(k) and security. Save it for the future, Jensen. Save it for the future. That's what you got to do.- They're all sitting pretty comfy. My huge takeaway. Lots of money. All right. Howley, great stuff.]"

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.99%.Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. drugstore chain had lost 4.98% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.04% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.42% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Walgreens Boots Alliance as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.10, up 14.58% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $33.84 billion, up 3.83% from the year-ago period.WBA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.50 per share and revenue of $136.18 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -10.71% and +2.62%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Walgreens Boots Alliance. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Starbucks due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Starbucks Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenues BeatStarbucks reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, both the top and bottom lines increased year over year.Investors’ sentiment was hurt after the company said that sales in China moderated after reopening. Average weekly sales in China are likely to increase sequentially in third-quarter fiscal 2023 but at a moderate pace than what it witnessed in second quarter.Discussion on Earnings, Revenues &amp; CompsIn the quarter under review, SBUX reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 74 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents by 15.6%. The bottom line increased 25.4% year over year from an adjusted EPS of 59 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly revenues of $8,719.8 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,404 million by 3.9%. The top line increased 14.2% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by growth in comparable store sales and net new store. Solid performances in global licensed store businesses added to the positives. Global comparable store sales increased 11% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by a 4% rise in average tickets and 6% rise in comparable transactions. In the fiscal second quarter, Starbucks opened 464 net new stores worldwide, bringing the total store count to 36,634.Overall Margin Expansion in Q2On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin was 14.3%, up from 13% reported in the prior-year quarter. The upturn was mainly driven by sales leverage, pricing, productivity improvement and gain on the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee brand. The margin gain was marginally overshadowed by investments in labor and inflationary pressures.Story continuesSegmental DetailsStarbucks has three reportable operating segments — North America, International and Channel Development.North America: Net revenues were $6,380.6 million, up 17% year over year. The segment benefited from 12% growth in company-operated comparable store sales and new store growth. Average ticket and transaction increased 5% and 6%, respectively. Operating margin in the North American segment was 19.1% compared with 17.1% reported in the prior-year quarter. Strategic pricing, sales leverage as well as productivity improvement drove SBUX’s margin.International: Net revenues were $1,854.8 million, up 9% year over year. A 7% gain in comparable store sales, 10% growth in net new store and improvement in its licensed store revenues primarily resulted in the uptick. However, this was marginally offset by nearly 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Operating margin expanded 640 basis points (bps) year over year to 17%, driven by sales leverage and lapping amortization expenses. In the fiscal second quarter, comps in China rose 3% year over year (against the 23% fall reported in the prior-year quarter). The increase was caused by a 4% rise in transactions. However, in average tickets it declined 1%.Channel Development: Net revenues increased 4% year over year to $480.7 million. The upside was primarily driven by growth in its Global Coffee Alliance. Meanwhile, the segment’s operating margin expanded 1,180 bps year over year to 54.5%, primarily driven by gain on the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee brand.Financial DetailsThe company ended fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3,0716.8 million compared with $2,818.4 million as of Oct 2, 2022. As of Apr 2, long-term debt totaled $13,544.8 million compared with $13,119.9 million as of Oct 2, 2022. Meanwhile, management declared a quarterly cash dividend of 53 cents per share. The dividend will be payable on May 26, to shareholders of record as of May 12.Other UpdatesThe Starbucks Rewards loyalty program’s 90-day active members in the United States increased to 30.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 15%.GuidanceSBUX reiterated its fiscal 2023 guidance. It anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of the 7-9% target. Margin improvement is expected on a sequential basis in third and fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. The company anticipates earnings per share to increase sequentially in third and fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. However, third-quarter fiscal 2023 EPS is likely to be well below SBUX’s yearly guided range of 15-20%.During the year, management expects store count in the United States and China to grow 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditure is estimated to be $2.5 billion. Consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 are anticipated to grow 10-12% on a year-over-year basis.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Starbucks has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

However, the bottom line declined 15.7% year over year.Total revenues fell 10% year over year on a reported basis or 1% on a constant-currency basis to $1,036.9 million. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% and our estimate of $995.8 million.The better-than-expected quarterly earnings were due to strength in the Middle East business, Evolve 2025’s momentum, lower consumer acquisition costs and transaction growth. However, adverse currency impact, discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus and promotional pricing activities affected the results.Q1 PerformanceAdjusted operating margin of 20.5% deteriorated 130 basis points year over year due to lower revenues and increased technology and market-linked investments. First-quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 13.5% was higher than 13% in the year-ago period.Western Union’s total expenses came in at $832.2 million, down 9% year over year.

The segment’s revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. Operating income plunged 14% year over year to $177.8 million.

The second closing related to the sale of the United Kingdom operations was made in December 2022. In the third stage, the European Union operations included within the Business Solutions unit is expected to be divested in the second quarter of 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, Western Union has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Western Union has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerWestern Union belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), has gained 3.2% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Fidelity National reported revenues of $3.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.5%.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.In the midst of uncertain economic conditions globally, the healthcare sector has displayed a notable degree of resilience. Historically, the demand for healthcare products and services has proven to be relatively inelastic. The healthcare sector’s strength was evident during the equity downturn experienced in 2022 as well, where the sector outperformed broader equity markets. According to BlackRock, healthcare stocks demonstrated 23% less volatility compared to the overall market during the last year. In the past seven recessions, the healthcare sector has consistently surpassed broad market performance by an average margin of 10%. Furthermore, over the span of the last six recessions, earnings within the industry have experienced an average growth of 21%. Some of the best healthcare stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Like many other industries, the healthcare sector underwent significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report released by Deloitte, approximately 70% of the global population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.  As the global economy returns to the new normal and the COVID-19 pandemic moves towards the endemic stage, the healthcare sector is adapting to new trends to shape its future outlook. One notable shift in the industry is the increasing virtualization of care, which has not only transformed the way healthcare services are delivered but has also attracted new players in the industry. For instance, in 2021, the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente jointly invested $110 million into Medically Home Group, a venture company focused on hospital-at-home services.Story continuesIndustry's Growth TrajectoryThe delivery of healthcare services is no longer restricted to healthcare companies only, but leading technology and retail companies are now making a play at it as well. In November 2021, leading electronics retailer Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) invested $400 million to acquire the care-at-home platform Current Health. Meanwhile, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also partnered with Zimmer Biomet to develop remote sensors that could be installed in smartphones and smartwatches and used to track the recovery of patients following their knee replacement surgery. As per Deloitte, the remote monitoring devices segment is expected to gain more mainstream attention as its size is forecasted to increase from $30 billion in 2021 to $101 billion in 2028. This reflects an annual average growth rate of 18.9%.The overall demand for the healthcare sector can be gauged by the fact that one in three adults across the world has chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as of 2023. Meanwhile, one in every four individuals is expected to experience a form of mental illness during their life. According to Deloitte, over a period of 20 years, the world is expected to face an economic loss of $16.3 trillion due to mental illnesses. However, despite the rising demand for healthcare services, the sector’s ability to deliver remains constrained due to numerous factors. Around $935 billion, or 25% of the US healthcare expenditure, is wasted due to administrative red tape or inefficiencies, pricing irregularity, and labour shortages. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a shortage of 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals by 2035. Experts think an active adoption of technology and virtual delivery systems can help overcome such a significant shortage of healthcare professionals in the near future.15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe initially compiled an extensive list of companies actively involved in the healthcare sector. Next, we used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 to identify the stocks that attracted the highest number of hedge fund investors during the quarter.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was upgraded from a Market Perform to an Outperform rating, and the target price was revised from $90 to $100 by Evan Seigerman at BMO Capital. The analyst highlighted that the Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company has the “best-in-class” cell therapy portfolio that is backed by a stellar manufacturing ability. Furthermore, the company is also focused on improving its solid tumour oncology division by bringing Trodelvy into its portfolio by getting the drug’s commercialization rights in the Asian market from Everest Medicines.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”13. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a Nashville, Tennessee-based healthcare services company founded in 1968. The company operates a vast network of hospitals, outpatient centres, and other healthcare facilities across the US and UK. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is expanding its presence in Texas as it announced the acquisition of 41 urgent care centres from FastMed earlier this month. Presently, the company has 92 urgent care centres along with 45 hospitals and 395 physician practices present in the Lone Star State. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) has made an investment outlay of $6.6 billion in the last six years in the state. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 0.86% as of May 29.Renaissance Investment Management shared its stance on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Lastly, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) was another contributor. The company is seeing solid improvements in surgical volumes and overall healthcare usage. Meanwhile, labor expenses, which have weighed heavily on operating margins, appear to be reversing as extra headcount brought on to accommodate spikes in patient volumes due to COVID is finally subsiding.”12. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a San Diego, California-based medical device company founded in 1999 that specializes in the development and manufacturing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Matthew Blackman at Stifel increased the price target on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) from $130 to $140 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock in an investment note issued on April 28. The analyst shared that the company’s Q1 2023 results checked “all the important boxes,” in his opinion.Baron Funds shared its outlook on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”11. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67On May 18, Richard Newitter at Truist raised the price target on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) from $325 to $347 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. In April 2023, the stock price of the Sunnyvale, California-based robotic surgical system producer recorded the highest increase in three years following the release of the company’s Q1 2023 results. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) saw its revenue increase by 13.4% YoY to $1.69 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast of $1.68 billion. Meanwhile, the adjusted EPS was posted at $1.23 and was three cents higher than analysts' forecast.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.”10. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) secured tenth position on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy now. On May 11, an analyst at Argus raised the price target on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) from $320 to $350 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst noted that the acceptance of a supplemental biologics license application by the FDA for Leqembi for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s could be a growth catalyst for Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock. Furthermore, the review of Lecanemab in China, Europe, and Japan and, subsequently, its approval in these markets could provide further impetus to the growth outlook of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB).9. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based provider of health insurance products and services to individuals, employers, and government-sponsored programs.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home But now, some customers are facing trouble getting their money out of those accounts, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.Some users waited several weeks for money from their Apple accounts to be transferred to a different account. (Bank transfers typically only take a few days.) Customer service agents at Goldman Sachs—the bank that manages the Apple Savings account deposits—reportedly told one customer to wait a few more days each time they were contacted. In some cases, the agents offered customers inconsistent advice on what to do and in others, customers’ funds disappeared from their Apple accounts without showing up at their destination.“The customer response to the new savings account for Apple Card users has been excellent and beyond our expectations,” Goldman Sachs told the Journal in a statement. “While the vast majority of customers see no delays in transferring their funds, in a limited number of cases, a user may experience a delayed transfer due to processes in place designed to help protect their accounts.”Apple and Goldman Sachs did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.Pulling back from Main StreetGoldman Sachs is retreating from its Main Street offerings. CEO David Solomon spent years trying to bolster the company's consumer banking division. Yet business never picked up, costing the investment bank billions of dollars and pulling down its earnings.In February, Solomon said the bank was “considering strategic alternatives” for its consumer platforms business, which includes the Apple Card. The division doesn’t include Goldman's consumer bank Marcus, which offers its own savings accounts. During the bank’s earnings call in April, Solomon said he wasn’t concerned about Apple’s saving account program overpowering Marcus’ offerings, but he was keeping an eye on “cannibalization” nonetheless.Story continuesWhen Apple first announced its expansion into banking services in October, users were excited as the program offered cashbacks and a high yield on the Savings account for certain Apple card holders. The savings account offers a 4.15% yield rate—far higher than the average 0.25% for savings accounts. The account linked to the Apple Card also had no fees, minimum deposits or balance requirements—a big perk for customers who are typically subject to some of these conditions.“Apple Card users will be able to easily set up and manage Savings directly in their Apple Card in Wallet,” the iPhone-maker wrote in a statement announcing the program last year. “Users can also withdraw funds at any time by transferring them to a linked bank account or to their Apple Cash card, with no fees.”Apple’s foray into everyday banking is part of a larger effort by the tech titan to offer in-house financial services to keep users within its ecosystem. Earlier this year, Apple launched an interest-free buy now, pay later program, also facilitated by Goldman Sachs, where customers can pay for certain expenses in installments without incurring interest.But the financial services market could be a tough one for Apple to crack. The company faced delays in rolling out its BNPL and savings account programs. Other financial products like the Apple Card have not expanded internationally yet, Bloomberg reported, despite being around for three years.Still, there’s a lot of opportunity for Apple if it keeps users in its ecosystem. Apple Pay transaction volumes have been on an upward trajectory, with the 2022 holiday season seeing a 62% uptick compared to a year earlier, according to Deutsche Bank data cited by the Journal.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The eliminations follow a separate round of layoffs in January, when Goldman eliminated 3,200 workers, and additional layoffs last September.Waldron, speaking at a conference in New York on Thursday, cited a ""pretty difficult"" environment for Wall Street as a reason for the cuts, which will help with a previously stated goal of reducing $600 million from payroll. Trading revenue for Goldman may fall 25% in the second quarter.""We're more cautious. We're running the firm tighter,"" he said.Goldman's stock fell 2.3% Thursday.'Preparing for a tougher environment'Goldman is not the only Wall Street firm cutting back as deal-making dries up. The slowdown is largely due to a rapid rise in interest rates, economic uncertainty, and turmoil in the banking industry.Most major banks that advise on mergers or IPO underwriting reported drops in fee revenue during the first quarter. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman Sachs (GS), followed by a 25% drop at Citigroup (C) and a 20% drop at Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw investment banking revenue down 19%.Many of these banks decided to eliminate more positions this year, according to media reports. Cuts at Morgan Stanley (MS) will amount to roughly 3,000, and JPMorgan is culling roughly 500 positions. Citigroup and Bank of America are making smaller reductions of a few hundred jobs each.Goldman is planning for a total of $1 billion in expense cuts, including the new layoffs.John Waldron, Goldman's chief operating officer. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Brendan McDermid / reuters)""We're preparing for a tougher environment,"" Waldron said Thursday. ""We'd love to be surprised on the upside. We might be surprised on the upside. We can always flex into that but we definitely have a much more cautious tone.”Story continuesWaldron cited muted activity with private equity firms and less activity with larger companies while pointing to middle-market merger activity as a bright spot.Trading “is more sluggish,” said Waldron who added that compared to the second quarter a year ago, Goldman’s market division should post 25% lower revenue. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan executives have also warned recently that their trading results would decline in the second quarter.“We've had a couple of good weeks of equity capital markets activity. So you could envision that we might have a better back half of the year. We're not necessarily planning for that, but it certainly could happen,” Waldron added.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.45bUS$4.58bUS$5.99bUS$6.51bUS$7.14bUS$7.61bUS$8.00bUS$8.35bUS$8.65bUS$8.93bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x12Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.56%Est @ 5.22%Est @ 4.29%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$3.1kUS$3.7kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$102bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$102b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$36bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$74b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$42.8, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Schlumberger as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.498. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SchlumbergerStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Energy Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

RNR recently priced a public offering of senior notes worth $750 million in aggregate principal amount. The underwritten public offering, which is made to support its Validus acquisition, is expected to close on Jun 5.The senior notes carry an interest rate of 5.750% and are scheduled to mature in 2033. The transaction proceeds will primarily be used for financing a part of the cash consideration for the Validus acquisition from American International Group, Inc. AIG. RNR is buying Validus Re, AlphaCat and the Talbot Treaty reinsurance unit from AIG, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.The acquisition price for the AIG assets was set at $2.985 billion, which will be paid by RenaissanceRe partly in cash, amounting to $2.735 billion, while the remaining balance will be paid through its common shares. RNR even announced an underwritten public offering of 6,300,000 common shares earlier, linked to this acquisition.RenaissanceRe expects the senior notes to have a rating of A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Now, the question arises if moves like this will inflate its financial obligations and whether RNR can take it.The company exited the first quarter with a debt of $1,141 million, which decreased 2.5% from the figure as of Dec 31, 2022. It doesn’t have any additional debt maturing until 2025. Its total debt to total capital of 16.3% is lower than the industry average of 19.7%.It had cash and cash equivalents of $1,063.7 million at first quarter-end. Times interest earned, the metric reflecting a company’s ability to meet interest payments, stands at 2.74X for RenaissanceRe. The figure is higher than the industry average of 2.34X.

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 3.3% compared with 18.8% decline of the industry and a 0.4% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $8.49 billion. The company projects 14.6% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other, the average surprise being 17.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q1 Results: DaVita’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both segments during the period. DaVita also recorded an increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Mar 31, 2023, the company had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.Story continuesAs of Mar 31, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 were U.S. centers while 351 were located across 11 other countries. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of three new dialysis centers in the United States. It also opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 11.5% north to $6.69.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion, suggesting a 0.6% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Companies often face legal cases and police complaints their content sometimes hurt religious sentiment, and many have self-censored content over the years.As part of India's anti-tobacco drive, the health ministry this week ordered streaming platforms should within three months insert static health warnings during smoking scenes. Also, India wants at least 50 seconds of anti-tobacco disclaimers, including an audio-visual, at the start and in the middle of each program.In first signs of industry distress, executives of the three global streaming companies, and India's Viacom18 which runs billionaire Mukesh Ambani's JioCinema app, held a closed-door meeting, where Netflix said the rules would hit customer experience and push production houses to block their content in India, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.Executives in India also discussed ways of a possible legal challenge to assert that other ministries - IT and information &amp; broadcasting - have powers over streaming giants, and not the health ministry, said one of the sources.The companies, and India's health ministry, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters is first to report the industry's planned pushback.Already, all smoking and alcohol drinking scenes in movies in India's cinemas and on TV, under the law, require health warnings, but so far there were no regulations for the streaming giants, whose content has become increasingly popular.In 2013, Woody Allen stopped his film, Blue Jasmine, from being screened in India after learning about mandatory anti-tobacco warnings would be inserted into its smoking scenes.Story continuesActivists have welcomed new anti-tobacco rules by India, the world's second largest producer of tobacco that kills 1.3 million people each year in the country. India also has stringent cigarette pack warning rules.HEALTH VS WARNINGS ""HARASSMENT""Truth Initiative, a public health nonprofit group, in March said 60% of the 15 most popular streaming shows among 15- to 24-year-olds it analyzed contained depictions of tobacco, ""effectively exposing 25 million young people to tobacco imagery"" in 2021.But in India, companies from Netflix to Amazon to Disney, also have popular Hindi content which often shows Bollywood actors smoking, something activists say encourages tobacco use.India is a hot market for streaming giants, and executives fear business impact and higher costs. Ambani's JioCinema has just in recent weeks signed multiple content deals with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros, bringing popular shows like ""Succession"" and ""The Office"" on its platform.Together, the companies have millions of hours of content.""New content being created needs to be changed and old content needs to be modified. It could require insertion of ad-type warning in between,"" said Kaushik Moitra, partner at Bharucha &amp; Partners who advises streaming firms and production houses.During the Friday meeting, Amazon and other companies made the point there was no way films can be edited in three months, said the second source, adding the industry decided to consult lawyers and write letters in protest.Dylan Mohan Gray, a filmmaker who directed documentaries such as ""Fire in the Blood"", said the new Indian rules amount to ""harassment"", saying that murder, war and extremely violent crime scenes were not regulated in the same way.""Smoking, which though certainly a serious public health problem, is both legal and a massive source of government revenue in this country,"" he said.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil in New Delhi, and Biplob Kumar Das in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Tony Tharakan and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; editing by David Evans)]"

The exact tally of the vote is expected to be released in a regulatory filing.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesThe measure asked shareholders to vote on changes to the compensation packages of top Netflix executives, which were revised after fewer than a third of shareholders approved the 2022 deal.Under the terms put to shareholder vote on June 1, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, co-CEOs of Netflix, would see their salaries capped at $3 million each. But they would also be entitled to a minimum 50% allocation to stock options and an annual performance-based cash bonus program, which raised their total compensation package to around $40 million and $34 million respectively. Other executives would have seen their salaries increase or stay the same, although their stock options would have decreased. Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, would have suffered a drastic reduction in salary and stock options.Netflix v WritersUnion leaders from the Writers Guild of America have written letters to major shareholders at several media and entertainment companies, including Netflix and Comcast, asking them to vote against fatter executive pay packages in light of the writers’ battle for fairer compensation.“Netflix’s board needs to spend less time thinking up ways to pay its executive team more money and instead address the writers’ strike that is delaying major shows like Stranger Things” the WGA commented in a statement on Twitter following the vote, referring to the top Netflix series that is one of the shows affected by the strike.Story continuesExecutives at Comcast, which holds its annual general meeting on June 7, might face a similar shareholder rebuke.Quotable:“Approval of this compensation package is inappropriate in light of the ongoing WGA writers’ strike and the associated risks that Netflix executives are creating for investors.” —WGA West president Meredith Stiehm, in a letter to Netflix shareholders dated May 31 and quoted in The Hollywood ReporterBy the digits: Netflix’s executive pay packets$166 million: The total worth of Netflix’s compensation packages for top executives in 2022, including $50 million each to co-CEOs Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos.

Discovery stocks experience rough May",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/disney-paramount-warner-bros-discovery-153040564.html,1685633440,VIDEO,"['PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'WBD', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'CMCSA']","[Amid earnings reports and the ongoing writers' strike, media stocks struggled in the month of May. Yahoo Finance media reporter Allie Canal breaks down the stock performance of several media companies and what to expect going into the summer.Video Transcript- It was a brutal month of May for media stocks from weaker earnings to a writers' strike that plagues the industry. But can investors expect any type of turnaround in June? Well, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now. Allie, what did we see during May, and how does that set up for June now?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, the big question is, will we see some reprieve in June? If we take a look at how many of these prominent companies, especially these streaming facing companies performed, we saw Paramount, Disney, Warner Brothers Discovery, double digit declines over the month falling roughly 32%, 14%, and 17% respectively. Then, Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, that fell 6%.And just to compare, the S&amp;P 500 was relatively flat over the month. So this was not good. The one bright spot here was Netflix. That was able to eke out a nearly 20% gain as it rolled out its password sharing crackdown, which is a key revenue driver across the US and beyond. We also saw some positive data surrounding its ad supported tier last month.But even Netflix, which has been the perceived leader in the streaming wars, it's going to battle a lot of noise moving forward, especially when it comes to potential churn, subscribers leaving the service due to that crackdown. And that's something that all of these companies are really facing right now. We've seen a ton of layoffs business restructurings in the name of profitability.Along with that, content spending has slowed with MoffettNathanson predicting a flattening in 2023, which we have seen across the board. Netflix has been one of the most notorious spenders in the streaming wars. But even they said their content spending is going to be flat year over year at around $17 billion. They are reportedly looking to cut costs in other areas with The Wall Street Journal saying that they are looking to overall spending by about $300 million.Story continuesStill, I do want to call out this one chart from FactSet, which shows that even though Netflix might be pulling back on spending a little bit, it's still one of the only services to offer just a ton of content. That is upcoming summer releases. We've seen Netflix at a whopping 45 new releases this summer. In second place is Disney at 21.So really, I don't think it's a total coincidence that Netflix has been the only streaming giant to really outperform for the month of May heading into the summer season due to that content spend. But really, a lot of risks overall for many of these media companies.- Yeah, and not just a streaming giant just outperforming in general, because you compare that to a legacy company like Paramount, which continues to struggle and has had to do some consolidation-- I mean, they got rid of MTV News.ALLIE CANAL: Yes.- I never thought I would see that happen. I mean, look at that share price now. I mean, sure it's up today but down from some serious highs that it saw once upon a time.Speaking of the larger landscape of media companies, we know they're still grappling with the writer's strike, and there is the potential for another strike, right? So there are certainly some headwinds. Is there any reason to be bullish about media companies?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, you're absolutely right. On the writers' strike, many of these leaders have said, look, we have enough content bank to weather the storm for now. But the longer it goes on, the more it could potentially impact the bottom line.That being said, I do think there are reasons to be bullish. But investors are going to have to be really patient. A big driver here is advertising. That's something that I think a lot of investors are really optimistic about, these ad-supported tiers driving profitability.I also think you're going to see a lot more bundling, which we've already seen in the market with Paramount Plus and Showtime, that combination, the HBO Max and Discovery Plus combo. And then, even Disney said it's going to be folding Hulu content into Disney Plus to eventually offer a one-app experience there. And that drives further customer value.So analysts have by and large said they believe all these initiatives, all these restructurings. Everything that they're doing right now is going to pay off but down the line. So I've seen a lot of analysts telling their clients to really stay on the sidelines for some of these companies right now until they reach that streaming profitability. But again, just a big TBD heading into the summer.- Right, exactly.- Have to keep tabs on there. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal.]"
124,31fe80c7-2ff8-3e76-80a9-c41617edab42,PSX,2023-06-02,EnerSys and Sphere Entertainment have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enersys-sphere-entertainment-highlighted-zacks-122100351.html,1685622060,STORY,"['ENS', 'PSX', 'EOG', 'MPC', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 1, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares EnerSys ENS as the Bull of the Day and Sphere Entertainment SPHR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:EnerSys stock is standing out this earnings season after impressively surpassing its fiscal fourth-quarter EPS estimates on May 24.As a leader in stored energy solutions for industrial products, EnerSys was able to capitalize on its pricing power and increase organic growth. Notably, the Manufacturing-Electronics Industry is in the top 10% of over 250 Zacks industries which further bolsters EnerSys' Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).EnerSys remains well-positioned as a distributor of various industrial batteries, battery chargers, and other power equipment along with outdoor cabinet solutions. Already up +31% this year, there could be legs to the rally in EnerSys stock which scores an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.Q4 ReviewEnerSys achieved record net sales and operating earnings during the fourth quarter. Impressively, earnings came in 32% above EPS expectations at $1.82 per share compared to estimates of $1.38 a share. Fourth-quarter earnings also soared 51% from the prior-year quarter. On the top line, sales surpassed estimates by 4% at $989.90 million and rose 9% year over year.The impressive top and bottom line growth during Q4 also helped EnerSys achieve record numbers in annual sales and earnings. Total sales for EnerSys’ fiscal 2023 came in at $3.7 billion and increased 10% YoY with EPS of $5.34 jumping 19% from a year ago.Record Growth ContinuesMaking EnerSys stock more attractive is that its record fiscal 2023 is expected to be eclipsed going forward. EnerSys’ earnings are expected to soar 28% in its current fiscal 2024 and climb another 19% in FY25 at $8.19 per share.Story continuesFiscal 2025 projections represent 82% EPS growth over the last five years with 2021 earnings at $4.49 per share. Total sales are forecasted to be up 4% in FY24 and rise another 4% in FY25 to $4.04 billion.Bottom LineNow appears to be an ideal time to buy EnerSys stock as the company is poised to continue achieving record growth on its top and bottom lines. While there could certainly be more upside in shares of ENS this year, EnerSys stock is also becoming a very sound investment for 2023 and beyond.Bear of the Day:Sphere Entertainment currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as the company has moved futher away from profitability at the moment.The road ahead may be bumpy upon Sphere's spinoff from Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSG) on April 20. Sphere’s first independent venue is currently under construction in Las Vegas and will weigh on its bottom line with the company planning to open a second venue in London as well.Furthermore, Sphere’s two regional television networks, MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet will naturally face increasing competition from a plethora of streaming services.Declining Earnings EstimatesAlluding to the challenges ahead and the near-term impact of potentially opening a second venue in London is the decline in fiscal 2024 earnings estimates. Fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have largely declined from projections of $2.54 per share a month ago to forecast of an adjusted loss of -$1.77 a share.While earnings estimates for the current year have gone up, an adjusted loss of -$5.43 a share is still expected.Spinoff PerformanceTrading at $23 a share, the declining earnings estimates point to more volatility and downside risk ahead for Sphere stock. To that point, shares of SPHR dropped -20% in May and are now down -60% since its spinoff from Madison Square Garden.Bottom LineAlthough Sphere has a vision of being a next-generation entertainment company its growth potential from live performances is still a few years away. For now, investors may want to stay on the sidelines as declining earnings estimates for FY24 have dimmed Sphere’s outlook.Additional content:3 Dividend Stocks to Gain Despite Energy Market VolatilitySince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the market has witnessed wild swings in oil prices. This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby setting Marathon Petroleum Corp., EOG Resources, Inc. and Phillips 66 up for growth.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at close to $70 per barrel.Dividend Stocks to Keep an Eye OnOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.3 Stocks to GainMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. MPC is well poised to gain on strong refining fundamentals, backed by the reduction in refining capacity across the world. It pays out a quarterly dividend of 75 cents ($3.00 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.78% yield at the current stock price. (Check Marathon Petroleum’s dividend history here).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Marathon Petroleum Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteEOG Resources, Inc: In the United States, EOG Resources is a leading exploration and production player. Since transitioning to premium drilling, EOG boasted that it has returned billions in cash to shareholders. The firm pays a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of 82.5 cents ($3.30 annualized) per share. EOG also paid a special dividend of $1.00 per share on Mar 30.

QuotePhillips 66: Phillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and a logistic player with a presence in Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties businesses. With a strong focus on disciplined capital allocation and maintaining financial strength, PSX is well-positioned to continue rewarding shareholders with dividend growth. Phillips 66 pays a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of $1.05 ($4.20 annualized) per share.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Lead Independent Director, Robert Eckert, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$249 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$214. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of AmgenAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$186m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Amgen Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Amgen insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Amgen insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Amgen.But note: Amgen may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib)Amgen took on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, a KRASG12C inhibitor.1 LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep, and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the KRAS G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation.2Amgen is progressing the largest and broadest global KRASG12C inhibitor development program with unparalleled speed and exploring more than 10 sotorasib combination regimens, with clinical trial sites spanning five continents. To date, over 6,500 patients around the world have received LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS through the clinical development program and commercial use.In May 2021, LUMAKRAS was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to receive regulatory approval with its approval in the U.S., under accelerated approval. LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also approved in the European Union, Japan, United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, Qatar, and in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, Singapore, and Israel under the FDA's Project Orbis. Additionally, Amgen has submitted MAAs in Argentina, Colombia, Kuwait, Macao, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors.3 About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.4 Overall survival rates for NSCLC are improving but remain poor for patients with advanced disease, and 5-year survival is only 9% for those with metastatic disease.5KRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.6 About 13% of patients with NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.7 Unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation whose first-line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working. The outcomes with other approved therapies are suboptimal, with a median progression-free survival of approximately four months following second-line treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.8About Advanced Colorectal Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, comprising 10% of all cancer diagnoses.9 It is also the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.10Patients with previously treated metastatic CRC need more effective treatment options. For patients in the third-line setting standard therapies yield median PFS times of about two months and patients' response rates are less than 2%.11,12KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in colorectal cancers, with the KRAS G12C mutation present in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers.13,14,15About CodeBreaKThe CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to study patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers.CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors.16 Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline.4 The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) is fully enrolled and results have been published.17CodeBreaK 200, the global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC completed enrollment of 345 patients. Eligible patients had previously treated, locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes.18Amgen also has several Phase 1b studies investigating sotorasib monotherapy and sotorasib combination therapy across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.19 A Phase 2 randomized study will evaluate sotorasib in patients with stage IV KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in need of first-line treatment (CodeBreaK 201).20LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) U.S. IndicationLUMAKRAS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) Important U.S. Safety Information Hepatotoxicity LUMAKRAS can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity.Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations.Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severity of adverse reaction.Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis LUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients.Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 20% were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough.Drug Interactions Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, dietary and herbal products.Inform patients to avoid proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists while taking LUMAKRAS.If coadministration with an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, inform patients to take LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after a locally acting antacid.Please see LUMAKRAS full Prescribing Information. About Vectibix® (panitumumab)Vectibix is the first and only fully human monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of mCRC. Vectibix was approved in the U.S. in September 2006 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC after disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.In May 2014, the FDA approved Vectibix for use in combination with FOLFOX, as first-line treatment in patients with wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC. With this approval, Vectibix became the first-and-only biologic therapy indicated for use with FOLFOX, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens, in the first-line treatment of mCRC for patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC.In June 2017, the FDA approved a refined indication for Vectibix for use in in patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) mCRC.INDICATION AND LIMITATION OF USEVectibix® is indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX, and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.Limitation of Use: Vectibix® is not indicated for the treatment of patients with RAS mutant mCRC or for whom RAS mutation status is unknown.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION BOXED WARNING: DERMATOLOGIC TOXICITY Dermatologic Toxicity: Dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients receiving Vectibix monotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix®. The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix® for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune- related effects (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Withhold or discontinue Vectibix® for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications. Dose modifications for Vectibix® concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided in the product labeling.Vectibix® is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic RAS mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either KRAS or NRAS and hereafter is referred to as ""RAS.""Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of RAS mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing RAS mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents. Additionally, in Study 20050203, 272 patients with RAS-mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix® in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) in patients with RAS-mutant mCRC who received Vectibix® and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 20080763) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix® treatment, periodically during Vectibix® treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate.In Study 20020408, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix® administration. Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions.Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix® in combination with chemotherapy.Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix®. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms interrupt Vectibix® therapy. Discontinue Vectibix® therapy if ILD is confirmed.In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix® versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered.Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity. Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix®.Keratitis and ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for corneal perforation, have been reported with Vectibix® use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix® for acute or worsening keratitis.In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix® to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix®-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs &lt; 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0).NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix®-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (&lt; 1%) Vectibix®-treated patients. As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix®, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.Vectibix® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of Vectibix®.In monotherapy, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients with Vectibix® were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) with Vectibix® + FOLFOX were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% difference between treatment arms) were diarrhea and dehydration.To see the Vectibix® Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning visit www.vectibix.com.About Tarlatamab Tarlatamab is an investigational, targeted immunotherapy engineered by Amgen researchers to engage a patient's own T cells to delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) expressed on the surface of SCLC tumor cells.21,22 DLL3 represents an exciting therapeutic target for patients with SCLC, as approximately 85% of patients have expression of DLL3 on the cell surface of SCLC cells, with minimal expression in normal cells.23,24In a Phase 1 study, tarlatamab demonstrated a manageable safety profile along with encouraging response durability in heavily pretreated patients with SCLC.21Amgen is currently investigating tarlatamab in multiple trials, including DeLLphi-301, a potentially registrational Phase 2 study in heavily pretreated SCLC.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

Neighboring Andean producer Chile remains the world's dominant producer and supplier of the red metal.Both Peru and Chile have seen copper production plateau, linked to political and regulatory uncertainty.Peru's Mining Minister Oscar Vera said the country's copper industry could boost output of the key metal needed for the global electrification shift, adding that mines worth some $6 billion were set to come online over the next two years.Vera said Peru mining projects on the horizon include the $1.5 billion Zafranal mine and the $2.5 billion Yanacocha Sulfuros project controlled by Newmont Mining Corp.""The general manager (of Yanacocha) was with us a few weeks ago, and we were told of their decision to continue moving forward and that they plan to invest around $400 million through the end of the year,"" Vera said.Newmont did not respond to a request for comment.Vera also said government authorization would be coming soon for an investment of around $1.3 billion to expand the Aluminum Corp-controlled Toromocho mine.The Andean country has some $53 billion in pending mining projects, according to government data, but most are long term and have been delayed amid social and political unrest.(Reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Kylie Madry; Editing by David Alire Garcia, Edmund Klamann and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before getting started, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our team and how they have continued to navigate an extremely dynamic macro environment. On that note, let's discuss the current macro landscape. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we said that we expected pressure to be more intense in 2023 compared to 2022. Subsequently, demand trends began to worsen in mid-March and further decelerated in April.We believe cooler temperatures and headlines surrounding layoffs and the banking crisis were factors, but so were the compounding effect of some previously identified macro headwinds. The U.S. consumer, particularly at Macy's, pulled back more than we anticipated as they reallocated spend to food, essentials and services. We have planned our business for the remainder of the year, assuming mid-March through April macro headwinds continue and potentially worsen, and we have taken decisive actions in the second quarter and the back half of the year to ensure we are well positioned to compete.We will go into more detail on these shortly. But first, let's discuss first quarter results. We achieved adjusted diluted EPS of $0.56 versus our expectations net sales were below, gross margin rate was above and inventories were in line at down 7% year-over-year. February and early March performed largely in line with expectations. As previously mentioned, trends worsened in late March. We entered April confident in our product and had several important events, including Friends and Family of Macy's, the spring break season and Easter. As April progressed, demand worsened across nameplates. The decline was most pronounced at Macy's, which has the largest exposure to the lower and middle income consumer with roughly 50% of its identified customers and an average household income of $75,000 or under and about 85% at $150,000 or under. By nameplate, Macy's net sales declined 7.7% and comparable sales declined 7.9% on an owned plus licensed basis versus a 10.1% increase last year. We began the quarter with limited inventory carryover. Consistent with our inventory discipline, we had sold through the majority of fall and holiday product in the fourth quarter.In hindsight, we converted too early with spring fashion well set by early March, but without enough balance in weather-appropriate apparel and footwear. Store traffic was healthy but conversion was challenged. Most of the country experienced below average temperatures for an extended period of time, while we were over-indexed in spring and early summer fashion, including special occasion and did not have enough colder weather and seasonless product. Ultimately, sell-throughs were below expectations as our customer became increasingly more deliberate in how they are allocating discretionary spend and buying closer to need. On the flip side, categories we are known for that are less discretionary and weather dependent, including beauty, particularly fragrances, women's career sportswear and men's tailored all outperformed. We also began to experience a comeback in certain pandemic categories including textiles, housewares and top of table, which is encouraging.At Macy's Backstage, which curates lower price point merchandise and flows and freshness more often, store within stores outperformed the full-line locations in which they operate by approximately 150 basis points on a comp owned plus licensed sales basis. These locations benefited from a greater emphasis on seasonless product and a strong value proposition. We currently operate a 310 back stages, including 301 store within stores and plan to open 9 more this year. Our luxury nameplates, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury were also impacted by macro pressures, although not at the same rate or intensity as Macy's. Bloomingdale's results were roughly in line with our expectations. Net sales declined 2.3% and comparable sales were down 4.3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus a 26.9% gain last year.Bloomingdale's registered strength in beauty, particularly fragrances, men's and women's contemporary apparel and housewares. Bloomingdale's outlet, a relatively undeveloped part of the nameplate that appeals to the more value-conscious luxury customer also continued to outperform. At Bluemercury, results once again exceeded expectations, benefiting from our differentiated product mix and unique competitive position as a luxury beauty retailer. Net sales rose 4.4% and comparable sales increased 4.3% versus a 25.2% gain last year, benefiting from strength in clinical and medical skin care as well as color.Quarter-to-date, demand trends have accelerated from April across nameplates. As the weather has turned more seasonal, our customer has been responding well to our compelling offerings and price points. We are likely also benefiting from pent-up demand. Although encouraging, we do not have clarity on whether or not these improvements indicate a trend change reflective of a healthier consumer. These improvements have been strongest at Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, potentially indicating a further bifurcation of customer behavior by income tier, which we are closely monitoring. While first quarter adjusted EPS at Macy's, Inc. was ultimately better than our expectations, we did not end as strong as we would have liked. We will not carry problems from one quarter to the next. We have moved quickly to improve the composition of our assortments for the back half. At the same time, we are also taking a more cautious view of our customer. The high end of our second quarter and full year guidance ranges assume heightened macro pressures experienced in mid-March through April that they persist, while the low end of both contemplates potential deterioration as the year progresses. If demand improves, we will use our ample inventory receipt reserve, which is above last year's levels to chase into areas of strength as they materialize. Availability of goods remains robust, and we are confident that with our strong liquidity position, we will be able to secure the right product to support demand curves, if justified. Now let's turn to the specific actions we have taken to ensure we are well positioned to compete in the back half and longer term. For the second quarter, we have accelerated the timing and depth of promotional events, markdowns and clearance at Macy's to liquidate seasonal merchandise. This includes slower moving first quarter spring transitional receipts as well as May flows that we were unable to impact following the rapid deterioration in demand. We are utilizing our pricing science tools to approach markdowns and promotions with precision to maximize merchandise margin. We have also adjusted the timing, composition, amount and value proposition of receipts. For the third and fourth quarters, we are leaning into categories that are working, like beauty, career sportswear and gifting and are further reducing our emphasis on down-trending categories. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter and our leading position as a gifting destination, this year, we will have more newness compared to last year, including exclusives that leverage our strong vendor relationships in beauty, where we had great Mother's Day and Valentine's Day performance and in toys.We also recognized the need for a better balance of cold and warm weather goods at Macy's. Adjustments have been made to flow product closer to need. In addition, we are working with our partners to offer more seasonless year-round fashion content. Other actions taken, improved receipt flow and in-stock position within our core assortment, enhanced pricing algorithms to maximize sales, margin and competitive positioning and updated marketing messaging to speak to our even stronger value proposition.It is imperative that we have the right assortment, including the appropriate mix of private and national brands that our customers care about with compelling value and price points that appeal to our diverse fashion-conscious base. Value does not mean the lowest price. It means offering the right brands, fashion content and elevated omnichannel shopping experiences. This morning, we are excited to share that we are bringing Nike back to the Macy's nameplate this fall. This mutually beneficial relationship reflects our strategy to provide customers with an enhanced and elevated offering. Starting in October, an expanded Nike selection, including apparel, plus size women's, big and tall men's, kids, bags and gear will be available online and in key locations nationwide. Footwear will continue to be sold in our Finish Line licensed locations. We look forward to scaling our Nike partnership with additional locations in spring of 2024. We remain focused on the long term. Balance sheet health and cash preservation are critical to achieving our goals. About 6 months ago, we embarked on a cost-savings project to reimagine our ways of working, drive clear prioritization across key enterprise capabilities and reduce complexity. Given late first quarter trends, that work was accelerated, and we have identified an additional $200 million of cost savings for this year and roughly $300 million to $350 million of savings in 2024. We have also reduced this year's planned CapEx spend by roughly $50 million. Adrian will discuss the specifics, but investments in our five growth vectors remain protected. Our ambitions are greater than our recent results. As a seasoned retailer, we understand the challenges that we are facing, and we'll continue to pull the levers needed to achieve our aspiration of low single-digit sales growth and a sustainable low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin beginning in 2024.The biggest risk to achieving that goal is that pressures on the consumer further intensify at an accelerated rate next year. I am confident that we have the right strategy and team to lead us into the future. I have a tremendous amount of personal and professional respect for incoming CEO, Tony Spring. He is an excellent merchant and marketer and has a well-deserved reputation as an innovator, brand builder and talent developer. And this marks Adrian's first call as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a promotion that is well deserved. Adrian's strategic thinking and financial acumen have enabled us to achieve our current position of financial strength and has set us up to continue to make crucial investments for future success. Congratulations to you both. I look forward to what you will achieve together. And I know you're all excited to hear from Tony, so I'm going to turn it over to him for some brief comments.Antony SpringThank you for the introduction, Jeff, and for your leadership and tremendous support. And thank you to our Board of Directors for their confidence and support. I also want to acknowledge the entire leadership team and our colleagues for their ongoing commitment to our brands and business. Please know how humbled and honored I am to have been chosen to take on Macy's Inc.'s CEO role this upcoming February.For those of you I have not met before, let's start with my background and approach to leadership. I consider myself a curious generalist, who brings a high level of self-awareness and ambition to the teams I lead. As many of you know, I began my career at Bloomingdale's roughly 36 years ago. During my tenure, I've split my time somewhat equally between merchandise, marketing, stores and senior leadership. As I look back, I've always viewed the area I was in as the engine that was driving the business. Today, I realize how complementary and intertwined they all are. As a merchant, our products must be curated and compelling. As a marketer, our strategy must be engaging, inspiring and personalized.Of course, our digital experience is closely linked as the window to our brands and a large source of commerce. As a stores leader, we must rally our colleagues around an enjoyable and differentiated experience centered on the customer. Finally, as a senior leader, we must ensure that our recipe includes the right balance of all of these elements. Over the last decade, I've had the distinct privilege of leading Bloomingdale's. I want to take a moment to acknowledge my team there.During my tenure, we achieved record sales and customer and colleague engagement. Coming off our 150th anniversary, Bloomingdale's offers a curated merchandise assortment and has a loyal following. Our loyalty program is best-in-class, and our marketing is distinctive with events, activations and pop-ups animating many campaigns, which underscores my personal belief in retailers there. I view Macy's Inc. as an incredible and unparalleled portfolio of nameplates and brands, representing off-price to luxury, on-mall to off-mall, private to national brands, our multichannel, multigenerational and multi-category platform gives us opportunity to satisfy the customers' appetite for all of our categories.It's important to acknowledge the tremendous progress we've made as we've modernized our business, which sets us up for future success, but it's also important to recognize that across nameplates, we have room to improve. That is what makes our potential so exciting to be a part of. My experience at Bloomingdale's bring an outsider insider perspective to the Macy's brand, which is beneficial during this heightened period of uncertainty.Over the next several months, I intend to continue to listen and learn and lead my new areas of responsibility, which include merchandise, marketing and digital strategy. I will do so with clear eyes and a focus on what's possible long term while maintaining a disciplined approach to near-term controllables. I look forward to sharing my thoughts and observations as the year progresses. One thing I know for certain is that this is a renowned business and one which I'm incredibly passionate about. Recent results and our revised outlook have not changed my view. However, we were out of balance in the first quarter, overemphasizing spring seasonal merchandise rather than cold weather and seasonless merchandise. We are containing the related markdown to the second quarter and have adjusted the timing amount and composition of buys for the fall and holiday.Turning to the long term. I now want to take a moment to provide my thoughts on each of our five growth vectors, which are designed to focus our resources and our teams on the leverage that will bring top line growth back to Macy's, Inc. in 2024 and beyond. While still early, we believe that each will be a meaningful contributor to the future. First, let's start with Macy's private brands. I firmly believe that our success is tied to the right combination of compelling private brands, popular national brands and the curation of unique brands appropriate for our target customers, all of the compelling value equation. That has been one of our formulas of success at both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. In my new role, I have had the pleasure of working even more closely with the Macy's private brand team on their strategy.During the first quarter, INC Women's and Club Room Men's both of which have been reimagined, outperformed their respective broader apparel segments at Macy's. Looking ahead, we are excited about the launch of our newest brand, which will offer women's apparel and accessories later this summer. Stay tuned. Our second growth vector is small format stores. These allow us to optimize our total store portfolio at both Macy's and Bloomingdales' through replacement, densification and new market opportunities. They balance our traditional large-format on-mall locations with a more localized off-mall experience that's physically closer to our existing and target customers, encouraging a higher frequency of trips.We're continuing to enhance these stores and are learning every day how we can better serve our customers. Results are very encouraging. During the first quarter, our small format stores opened at least one fiscal year achieved positive comparable owned plus licensed sales group. Customer experience scores, particularly regarding the physical environment, ease of checkout and colleagues being helpful and available are high. Interestingly, we are experiencing limited-to-no cannibalization in existing markets where we open off-mall formats. Instead, customers are making additional shopping trips. Long term, we remain bullish about the small format store opportunity as off-mall retail continues to be a dominant in-person shopping method for U.S. consumers, and we're evaluating potential locations to enable accelerated growth. We look forward to sharing more as this work develops further. Now on to our third growth vector, Macy's marketplace. We are seeing new customers and a younger existing customer respond to our new and expanding categories, which has resulted in increased basket size.During the first quarter, we added approximately 450 brands ending the quarter roughly 950 brands. We're seeing indicators of a strong growth rate with marketplace's gross merchandise value increasing over 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and average order value and units per order approximately 50% above those customers not [shopping] at marketplace. Needless to say, we are very excited to launch a Bloomingdale's marketplace earlier in the fall. Our fourth growth vector is luxury. With fiscal 2022 representing record sales at both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, we're excited to continue to invest in both nameplates. The teams are attracting sought-after brands, leveraging their distinctive marketing and satisfying their core customer.Based on the power of our relationships with our vendors and customers, I see opportunity for store, digital and marketplace growth in both nameplates. At Macy's, we've made a commitment to elevate our beauty business with a larger luxury assortment. We first began to offer more luxury beauty at Macy's in 2018 and has since added many brands, including Carolina Herrera Beauty, which is exclusive; Armani; Saint Laurent; Tom Ford; Gucci, Maison Margiela; and La Mer, just a name a few. This is an area that even in the current environment, we're seeing very limited price resistance and even more partnerships on the horizon. Last but certainly not least, our fifth growth vector, personalized offers and communications. The power to talk to over 40 million consumers with the right offer at the right time really resonates with me. I believe it will be a true unlock for both our promotional offerings and merchandise messaging. During the first quarter, we leaned into personalization of a customer's offer within our typical event structure. These tests, which were based on predictive behavioral models allow us to show different customers' various value propositions by level of discount and category of offer.This is in addition to loyalty life cycle offers such as [data's] earn-back accelerators and targeted offers to at-risk customers. Testing suggest that personalized offers can foster sales growth, margin expansion and stronger customer engagement. We have accelerated our analytics-powered campaigns in the second quarter, and we'll use learnings to inform our view of opportunities at both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury.Now before I turn it over to Adrian, let me say how excited I am to be working even more closely with him and to have his counsel, leadership and partnership. What makes this transition so seamless and the succession so thoughtful is the complementary skills that Adrian and I bring to this company. He has had a noticeable impact on the organization since he joined almost 3 years ago. Our balance sheet health, including no material debt maturities until 2027 and fixed interest rate debt give us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our long-term opportunities and return capital to shareholders despite the uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment.  With Jeff's support, we will return Macy's Inc. to profitable growth. I look forward to getting to know all of you and sharing our progress. Now I'll turn it over to Adrian.Adrian V. MitchellThanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking Jeff and the Board for their ongoing belief and trust in me. From bringing me on three years ago as Chief Financial Officer to recently expanding my responsibilities to include stores, supply chain and technology. With my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer, I have the opportunity to go deeper into the design and execution of our long-term goals. As we aim to maximize opportunity and value, I am hyper-focused on building a faster, more flexible and more efficient operating model that drives sustainable sales and margin growth by creating alignment on those priorities that will have a meaningful longer-term impact on this business.  That's a multiyear effort. And as I think about how to tackle it, I have started with several fundamental questions. What can we do to better serve our customers and improve the end-to-end omnichannel shopping experience? How do we optimize our physical store footprint with the small-format stores to accelerate growth while enhancing our inventory flow, merchandise planning and localized assortment capabilities and evaluating our updated growth aspirations, how do we further modernize our supply chain and technology infrastructure to support the omnichannel shopping experience we aspire to deliver in the future. Reflecting on the last two months, I've been on a listening tour, spending a lot more time in stores, DCs and with the technology team identifying areas of opportunity. As I have been ramping up on these businesses, I've been highly encouraged to see stability in hiring, retention and turnover and have been impressed with the talent across these teams. I've also spent a significant amount of time with Tony. His experience in merchandising, marketing and stores serves as a nice balance to my years in large-scale transformation and consulting and my background in retail operations, including data and analytics, technology, strategy, stores and supply chain.He is a seasoned operator that understands department stores and fashion inside and out while I'm the transformational specialists focused on modernizing our retail operations. We are fully aligned of what is needed to propel Macy's Inc. into the future. We will maintain a disciplined approach to our inventories and markdown liability, offer differentiated products and value to our customers and we'll not chase unprofitable sales. For us, that's now table stakes. Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen the foundation of our core businesses while simultaneously investing in our five growth vectors. Despite recent headwinds, Tony and I remain committed to our aspiration of achieving low single-digit sales growth and a sustainable low double-digit EBITDA margin starting in 2024.Now let's walk through the first quarter results of our five value-creation levers before I provide an update on our 2023 outlook. First, omnichannel sales. We generated net sales of $5 billion, a decline of 6.8% versus the prior year. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 7.2%. Macy's, Inc owned AUR rose 4.7%, driven by ticket increases and category mix. For the year, we continue to expect an improvement in AUR year-over-year through a combination of ticket increases, lower markdowns and category mix.  Next, other revenue. As a reminder, beginning this quarter, we are reclassing credit card revenues and Macy's Media Network revenue to other revenue. Credit card revenues were previously reported as their own cash in, while Macy's Media Network revenue was reported within SG&amp;A. During the quarter, other revenues were 3.8% of net sales. Credit card revenues were $162 million, down $29 million from last year. As a percent of net sales, credit card revenues were 3.3% or 30 basis points lower than last year, primarily reflecting the impact of higher bad debt within the portfolio. Macy's Media Network revenue was $29 million versus $26 million in the prior year. Moving to the second value creation lever, gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 40%, 40 basis points above prior year. Merchandise margin was flat, benefiting from lean beginning of the year inventory levels and lower clearance markdowns, offset by promotion and category mix shifts. As it relates to delivery expense, continued cost mitigation efforts contributed to a 40 basis point improvement versus last year, primarily on better contracted rates, reductions in packages per order and a 1-point decline in digital penetration.The third value creation lever is inventory productivity. Inventory declined 7% year-over-year, in line with our net sales decline. Trailing 12-month inventory turnover was down 2% to last year, reflecting the decline in sales versus the comparable period. Adjustments to the timing, amount and composition of receipts beginning in the second quarter are expected to drive back half sell-throughs and strengthen inventory productivity. Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&amp;A increased $45 million or 2.4% to $1.95 billion. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue was 37.7%, 350 basis points higher than last year. As a reminder, the increase in minimum wage for stores colleagues was fully implemented on May 1 last year. The higher year-over-year SG&amp;A dollars and rate reflects the lapping of these increases and includes continued investments in colleagues across competitive pay incentives and benefits.SG&amp;A also includes the increase in depreciation and amortization expense. After accounting for interest and taxes, first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.56 versus $1.08 in 2022. Lastly, the fifth value creation lever capital allocation. Our top focus is liquidity. We continue to take a thoughtful approach to capital allocation, prioritizing a healthy balance sheet, investments in our business and our five growth vectors and returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we generated $105 million of operating cash flow compared to $248 million last year, primarily due to lower earnings in the current year quarter versus last year. We invested $296 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow inclusive of proceeds from real estate was an outflow of $166 million. As part of our open-ended share repurchase authorization, we bought back approximately 1.4 million shares for $25 million. We also paid $45 million of dividends. Now on to our outlook.Let's start with a discussion of our cost savings efforts. As Jeff mentioned, we have identified an incremental $200 million of cost savings for this year versus our prior outlook. For 2024, we estimate the savings to be between $300 million and $350 million, impacting both gross margin and SG&amp;A. Roughly 30% of the savings in 2023 will be in gross margin, and the remainder will be in SG&amp;A. A small portion has been recognized in the first quarter. Savings build as the year progresses and will be most significant in the fourth quarter.Now let's discuss our full year and second quarter outlook, both of which contemplate ongoing pressure on our customer. The low end assumes macro pressures worsen while the high end assumes they remain stable with levels experienced in mid-March through April. With so many mixed signals, it is prudent to take a cautious stance. We will continue to embrace the financial and operational disciplines that we have implemented over the past several years. If demand improves, we will lean into our reserves and chase intra-quarter. But we are going to wait for proof points to do that, and our improved May trends are not enough.Alternatively, if demand trends worsen, we have the flexibility to make further adjustments. We can and will do better. We have been course correcting and have made adjustments to the second, third and fourth quarters. Looking at the full year, our expectations for Macy's, Inc. are now as follows: net sales of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion. Comparable sales on a 52-week owned-plus license basis to be down about 7.5% to 6% year-over-year. As a reminder, compares ease in the third and fourth quarters. Other revenue to be about 3.6% of net sales with credit card revenues accounting for 82% to 83% of that. The reduction in our credit card revenue outlook is primarily a result of our reduced annual sales expectations. A gross margin rate of 38% to 38.5% on our expectation for deeper markdowns in the second quarter to drive sell-throughs and ensure we enter the third quarter in a clean inventory position. The second quarter should be viewed as an exception, not a change in course.Our philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to be focused on protecting gross margin. We will navigate the year with the intent to stimulate increased conversion and margin dollar expansion. Our annual gross margin rate outlook also includes an estimate for increased shrink, which we call shortage relative to our initial expectations. Starting in Q2, we have further enhanced our pricing science capabilities to automate strategic promotions from vendor direct to owned inventory. This gives us the opportunity to bring an automated pricing solution that incorporates category elasticities, maximizes inventory turnover and optimizes unit sales left and margin dollar expansion to our owned inventory portfolio.In addition, we also continued to refine our competitive intelligence, which provides us a better understanding of the competitive landscape and enhances our decisions around location-level pricing. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue is expected to be about 35.4% to 35.5%, reflecting the reduction in our sales expectations, along with the cost savings work discussed earlier.And adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.8% to 9.4% or 9.1% to 9.7% as a percent of net sales. After interest and taxes, we are estimating annual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70 to $3.20. This takes into account a roughly $0.12 negative impact from increased shortage relative to our previous expectations. Our adjusted EPS guidance does not assume the impact of potential share repurchases but does consider the proactive actions taken for the back half.For the second quarter, we expect net sales of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. Gross margin rate to be down no more than 100 basis points for the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter includes clearance markdowns to address remaining first quarter seasonal inventory and May receipts that we were unable to adjust in time to align with our updated sales expectations. We expect this to be the only quarterly deterioration to prior year.Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15. End-of-quarter inventories to be down low to mid-single digits to last year on a percentage basis. While we cannot control the macro environment and how our consumers respond, we remain focused on offering our customer the best product, experience and value. There is no finish line for this work. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress across the organization. We have reduced our reliance on markdown allowances, shifted to an upfront cost negotiation model with vendors, incentivized merchants at the Macy's Inc. level rather than by their respective category performance and build data and analytics into our processes. Looking ahead, the Macy's nameplate is shifting to cost accounting in 2024, which should help incorporate further disciplines. These actions together speak to how we are running our business from a much healthier and more educated place than in the past. So while we recognize the macroeconomic climate has created a larger headwind on our business than originally anticipated when we first introduced our annual outlook in early March, we are responding and remaining agile to ensure we meet the needs of our customers. The disciplines we have built into our decision-making and culture gives us the foundation to balance the current environment while executing with clarity on our long-term growth goals. We remain committed to our aspiration of achieving low single-digit sales growth and a sustainable low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin beginning in fiscal 2024, even with the assumption that macro pressures persist. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.Jeffrey GennetteThanks, Adrian. We are a modern department store with a rich history that has weathered these storms before, and we will do so again. Our financial health, operational efficiencies and data-driven process and tools are unique advantages that allow us to navigate through uncertain periods as we continue to invest in the future. We are a competitive team here at Macy's. We are not standing still. We are committed to better serving our customers and improving our business. Our teams are fully aligned, and we remain focused on protecting and preserving the second half of 2023 in our future growth opportunities, including achieving our sales and EBITDA goals. And with that, operator, we will open it up for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo first, Tony, congrats on the promotion. Maybe high level, where do you see the largest low-hanging fruit for acceleration opportunity as you take the helm? Jeff, could you elaborate on the cadence of top line trends? And in particular, where have you seen this most recent acceleration, whether by category or across income cohorts? And then finally, for Adrian, with this dynamic backdrop, what's your comfort with inventory on hand and just your confidence in clearing any excess by the end of this quarter?Jeffrey GennetteSo Matt, let me go first, and then we'll turn it over to Tony and Adrian. On the cadence of the top line, what you saw was that when you looked at our demand and what was happening in the -- February hit our expectations. As did early March. It started to deteriorate in the latter part of March, and then it decelerated even further in the month of April. So what we saw there was when you look at the seasonal categories, so we basically had -- we thought the appropriate level of carryover in fall and holiday, we had some fresh transitional receipts there. We sold through that pretty aggressively in the first half of the quarter and did not have enough content in those categories as we look at the back half. We had well transitioned into spring and seasonal, and we did not have the sell-throughs that we expected at regular price and when we started to mark it down. So that's the piece that when we're starting to see those inventory levels come up, which is where we kind of bucketed where we're going to be in the second quarter to deal with that to have the appropriate units going into the third quarter.So that would be on kind of the cadence of the top line. When you look at the recent trends in the month of May, you definitely saw a bounce back across nameplates, but most pronounced when you look at Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. So that's the comment that we're making. We're attributing that to two things. One is that it's a pent-up demand for warm weather categories, which is definitely where we saw the acceleration of sell-throughs or is it an improvement in the macro environment? We don't know that answer yet. So when you look at our guide for both the second quarter and the balance of the year, just to reiterate where we're at, we looked at the trend from the end of March through April and extended that by brand, by category, all the way through the rest of the year.We obviously have lots of penetration differences between quarters. Certain businesses become much more important as you get to the back half of the year. We did this very scientifically. We looked at the 1-year CAGR. We looked at a 2-year CAGR. We even went back and looked at 2019. So that's how we approached when we looked at how we were looking at the top end. And then the lower end of the guide was really if the macro conditions step in and they get worse. So that is what's implied in our guide know that when you look at our overall strategy, our objective is to make sure that we are responding in the moment to how customers are transacting.What I would tell you about the customer right now, particularly on the Macy's side, is they're buying much closer to need. So our opportunity to have the receipt reserves that we have to be able to respond in time with all the abundance of inventory to send to market is prudent. So I'll turn it over to Tony to answer your first part of your question.Antony SpringThanks, Matt. I would say, first off, I'm obviously excited about the opportunity and excited about the team that I see at Macy's as being really dedicated, passionate and certainly committed to the overall business results despite the challenging business climate. Macy's is a beloved brand with a multigenerational customer base. The scale of the business really should be an asset. I do see, however, opportunities to simplify our operation, make the experience easier for our colleagues to execute and more enjoyable for our customer.I believe the Macy's Inc. portfolio should be one that we can leverage more fully from both off-price to luxury. I think we've done a good job of leaning into the opportunity on data science or the STEM part of our business. I think if you think of Steam, the art part of our business, we have more work to do on curation, imagination, storytelling and inspiration.Adrian V. MitchellTerrific. Just to speak and close out on the topic of inventory. The simple answer is that we're confident in clearing through the inventory coming out of the second quarter. And as you know, we have the track record around inventory management. Our track record is clear, and we're getting better and better every quarter. Just to put in perspective, we ended last year down 3% in inventory. We ended the first quarter down 7% in inventory. We expect to end the second quarter down low to mid-single digits on inventory, so we are confident given our capabilities and our tools.Now just to put in context, the way we think about inventories in terms of the volume, the mix and having fresh content. And the reality is what we experienced in the first quarter is that we transitioned early. That was a clear bet for us because we were able to have limited carryover coming out of the fourth quarter and coming out of holiday. So we entered in a very solid position, but the weather cooled. But when you look at our content, beauty healthy numbers; career sportswear, healthy numbers; men's tailored, healthy numbers; warm weather, spring seasonal for most of the quarter, soft numbers. So we're putting in our tools and our actions in place, which we have a clear track record on. And we are confident that we'll be able to work through the inventory and get back to a balanced perspective on inventory entering the fall season.OperatorThe next question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver ChenJeff, Tony and Adrian, I was curious about merchandise margins and promotions for the back half and what's implied in guidance. As you do take the markdowns in Q2, what's the duration of those? And how do you do those most efficiently? Would also love your take on just things you're monitoring with the consumer of that behavior. And I assume that the comp volatility is likely in transaction counts. I would love your thoughts on that. And lastly, Tony, what do you think about the younger customer and the opportunity there more broadly? How are you dissecting strategies with respect to that?Jeffrey GennetteOliver, let me take two of your questions. So the merchandise margins, when you look at that, as we indicated, we think that we're going to be above last year's levels for obviously saw that in the first quarter. We're anticipating that in both the third and the fourth and the second, we thought it was going to be within 100 basis points of last year. Now the full year will be higher than the previous year.What you see and can expect from us is that when you look at the spring overhang that we have right now and are anticipating that we will take the appropriate price markdowns there. And what we've been doing through the first part before we marked it down as we were doing higher POS on those. So that has a cycle that we're playing through. We've got -- we have a number of categories in which we're getting higher AURs and higher margins than we did last year. We're expecting that to continue.And then there's other categories in which we're getting sharper on our price points as we know that the customer is looking for promotional value right now. You can see what we're seeing in our price arms in both outlet as well as Backstage. But what we're doing with specials and what we're doing with flash sales. Those are all going to be comparable to where we were last year, and we're looking at the content right now of where that is going to be. So we have a lot of confidence when we look at the back half with respect to where we're going to be with pricing promotion. Probably more important when we look at the back half is where we're going to be with the newness and where we're going to be with all of our gifting categories and how we've rebuilt that based on all the learnings that we had from fourth quarter of last year. So that is how merchandise margin. So expect merchandise margins to continue to be stable and the promotional as I've described. So Tony.Antony SpringOliver, thanks for the question. Let me say first, we will continue to attract a multi-generational customer. I think it's an advantage of being a department store that we have five generations shopping with us. But in terms of your question and how we target and grow the younger customer base, I start with, I'm proud of the fact that the Bloomingdale team has generated more business with the younger customer than we did years ago.It starts with first having the brands consumers are looking for, so challenging our merchant team to be in the market and inquiring through marketplace or through our own distribution channels, those brands. Second is obviously a strong digital strategy. We know the younger customer starts first online. And then thirdly, making sure that we have a powerful presence in the social space. I think we've made some progress, we still have more work to do. I would also add that remember, all of our brands are great at being a part of life moments. And so whether that is sweet 16s, birthdays, anniversaries, wedding, first house first job, all those connote a younger customer. And I think we have an opportunity to own a greater share of that business.Adrian V. MitchellLet me amplify a point that Jeff made on margin, and then I'll speak to the consumer. With regards to the merch margin, I just want to be very clear that the deterioration of no more than 100 basis points is isolated to the second quarter. When you look at our annual outlook for the year on gross margin, it is going to be higher than last year. And as we think about the back half of last year, we have the opportunity to actually beat just given the softness on margin that we experienced in the third and fourth quarters.With regards to the consumer for the year, we're being cautious about the consumer. Now in the month of May, we have seen slightly better trends than what we saw coming out of April. But it's too early to tell from our perspective. So we're actually taking a cautious approach to the high end of our guide, which reflects the March and April trends, the low end of our guide assumes worsening of consumer trends. As we think about May and that favorability on the trends there, is it warm weather? Is it more compelling values? Is it pent-up demand? Is it a new trend? For us, it's too early to tell, so we're taking a cautious stance.OperatorThe next question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachJeff, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more context on the customer engagement trends that you're seeing between your higher-income demographic cohorts and your lower-income demographic cohorts as you ended the quarter and moved into May. Are you seeing evidence of trade down or further pressure on traffic or ticket among any specific sub demographic? And then for Adrian, can you provide a little bit more context on the additional cost savings that you identified. Where are these cost savings being sourced from? How much do you expect to drop to the bottom line? And are there further opportunities to continue to optimize your cost structure?Jeffrey GennetteSo Brooke, let me start with your question on customer behavior. As we've reported in past quarters, we're not seeing a trade down not yet. What we have seen is that all customer types, I'll speak to the Macy's brand, has been basically down about the exact same percentage. What we're seeing is that in some cases, with customers that are responding to either Backstage or they're responding to Market by Macy's, it's entailing another trip, and we're seeing more spend out of them.When you look at the dynamics of our transactions, what you see across all of our customers is basically an increase in AUR about the exact same basket size is what they had in their visits last year. So what they're doing is they're buying less units. They're buying with the higher AUR, so the basket size is about the same. They're coming with the expectation of spending x and that's what they're going out with. But we're not seeing where you're seeing that -- but when you look at the income types that you're seeing, one showing up in Backstage that didn't before. The ones that are showing up in Backstage are in the main house, and we're getting more spend out of them in aggregate. So what we saw in the month of May, though was a separation of the trend, the improvement in the trend at both Bluemercury as well as Bloomingdale's. So there is something that's on our radar screen to see does that more affluent customer. Are they -- is it showing up right now that they're healthier than the Macy's customer, Roach, obviously, watching that one very carefully.Adrian V. MitchellBrooke, great to be with you as well. With regards to cost savings, let me give a little bit of context. We started this work about 6 months ago. And so what we've been doing, given the trends that we saw in the first quarter and year-to-date is really accelerate those activities. The source of the savings comes from two places. The first is gross margin, which represents about 30%. The second is around SG&amp;A.Within gross margin, we really focus on our inbound freight, our carrier network, our delivery expense, and we've been able to contract lower rates. So this is something that should actually trickle into future years for us. The remaining balance is really around SG&amp;A, and it's about reducing the complexity within the business, repositioning the organization for growth and identifying operating expenses on the non-payroll SG&amp;A side that we can actually take out of the system.This year, we've identified an incremental $200 million of opportunity. Next year, the annualized run rate is $300 million to $350 million. In addition to responding to the environment, we've actually reduced our CapEx forecast laminate at that dimension from $1 billion to about $950 million. But to be clear, the growth vectors are protected. We're investing appropriately in the team and the initiatives to get back to growth in 2024. So we've been very surgical, very disciplined in where we're making adjustments and it's just going to be good for the business longer term.OperatorThe next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyWelcome, Tony, can you please expand on the AUR improvement you're expecting to see in the back half of the year, which categories. And also, can you expand a little bit on the store strategy, both for Bloomingdale's and for Macy's in the small store component? And lastly, welcome, Tony, what do you see as bringing over from Bloomingdale's to Macy's.Jeffrey GennetteDana, so let me take the one on AUR. And what you saw from our first quarter post was about a almost 5% -- a 4.7% increase. We do expect that we're going to have a higher AUR in the back half. A lot of that is category mix. So when you look at some of the higher AUR categories are trending for us, and that is driving up that what you see there. There's other categories in which our AUR is below last year based on where we see the environment, how we're looking at price matching, when you look at our competitive cycle, ensuring that we've got the best value for our customers as they're searching in that particular time.So we do expect an improvement in AUR year-over-year. I think that outlook reflects our expectation for all of the heightened markdowns that we're talking about in the second quarter and the planned markdowns that we have for what we're doing in the back half both POS as well as clearance. What I'd bring up is just that our inventory is in really good shape.So while we are heightened right now in spring merchandise, we are chasing opportunities in other categories, we are very committed to that. We have inventory reserve across all of our categories, even the ones that are down trending because freshness is the name of the game in our business, and we always have available content that's out there in the market to purchase. So any demand signal that our merchants have, just remember that our merchants are all rewarded based on the collective Macy’'s brand and how it's doing. So there's huge opportunities for us to ensure that the right customers are being addressed with the right content at the right time.So there is going to be AUR improvement and -- but through all of that, but at the end of the day, we're making sure that our receipts are consistent with where our customers are going.Antony SpringDana, nice to connect again. I appreciate the question. No one is a bigger fan of the Bloomingdale's brand in business than I am. But I would reframe your question is how do we develop a stronger portfolio. Where we can learn from each other without becoming one another. Bloomingdale's strength is certainly curation, bringing variety versus redundancy to the expanded assortments that we offer.Bloomingdale's has a great, strong, best customer base, representing a large portion of their business, but how do we create stronger best customer programs for each of our brands. While Bloomingdale's gets credit for retail-is-theater, The Parade, The Fireworks, the Flower Show are all a part of Macy's heritage. Each brand needs to develop compelling programs to motivate their customer base to engage more frequently, both in-store and online. So I'm looking forward to what we can do going forward.Adrian V. MitchellDana, good to be with you as well. With regards to our store strategy that focuses on growth and our small format stores is actually part of that. As we think about the store strategy, we feel good about the box size we're looking at, the format we're looking at the locations and the power centers that we've been having conversations with.But the thing that we're very excited about is what Tony spoke to earlier in the conversation, which is on a comp basis on small stores, what we're seeing is no cannibalization against the big box as well as comp positive growth in those stores that are not able to comp. So we're on to something quite special here, and we'll share more information as things progress.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citi.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious how your e-com business performed over the quarter versus stores, if you saw a similar fall off on e-com or was it more isolated to the store level? And then I'm curious if you could just talk about how you came into the year thinking about how you would manage inventory in the second half versus how you're planning inventories currently?Jeffrey GennettePaul dot-com and stores were very similar in terms of what happened to their performance in the first quarter. We came into the year expecting that, that was going to be the case that, however, we were modeling dot-com and stores. So just remember where we were in terms of penetration in dot-com. This is basically the resettling of that as customers are coming more back to the stores channel. Obviously, very influenced by what they see digitally, either they transact there or they do research there. But in 2019, we were at a 25% penetration of digital. And in '22, we were 33% after a high in the pandemic of 40%. That settles in '23 at 33%. So the dot-com business was off 1 point for where stores were in the first quarter, pretty consistent with what we expected. I would tell you that on the big headline with respect to both stores and digital is the traffic has been relatively good. So basically flattish online, slightly up in stores, conversion down in both at about the same rate. So we do expect that this is the reset year with the penetration between them, but we do expect more aggressive growth in digital in the future versus stores as we think about '24 and beyond.And that's going to be [hoisted] by a lot of ideas and strategies, the one of the big ones is going to be what we're doing with Marketplace. Marketplace had an outstanding first quarter. We're in the beginning stages of it. But to Oliver's earlier question, we're very excited to have about Marketplace is really attracting the Gen Z customer, particularly in categories where it was not economically feasible for us to carry in the past. So when it relates to the way that we kind of plan inventory, I think that outside of what happened to us in spring with spring seasonal content and seeing the drop off in sell-throughs across all different value buckets, everything else has pretty much performed as we expected it. Again, just to remind, we have a very healthy reserve. So if we're buying into a sales plan, we hold back in the receipts. We've worked all that out by our new model of working at upfront costing versus working on an MDA model or a markdown allowance model that we used to have in the past. So we're not buying really needless receipts where we have not seen the signal for customer demand, and we are not perfect here. We have so much opportunity. We've got a really good pricing science as it relates to how we mark down goods. We are developing much better pricing science in how we promote goods based on demand signals and personalized marketing and just the opportunities that we see there as well as being very responsive to where in common items like Levi or wherever it might be, a lot of retailers carry but making sure that we're well priced, so that the customer is not disappointed with our values versus a competitor. So all that goes into the mix. And I would just say that inventory control, not a lot of surprises outside of what we talked about in terms of spring seasonal sell-through.Adrian V. MitchellThe one thing I would add, just to amplify a few things on the inventory. Going back to the question earlier around the importance of volume mix and content. As we think about the volume, we've already made adjustments for the back half to align with our sales volume expectations for the balance of the year. The important actions were taken in Q2 to minimize liability going into the back half really gets into the mix for the back half of the year.The one thing I would amplify that Jeff spoke to earlier is we're gifting the destination. And when you think about the shift in our content getting into the back half, we're going to be leaning more into beauty and gifting, which is 30% of our business in the first quarter but exceeds 40% in the fourth quarter. And the beauty business has been growing going through the first quarter. So we feel that we're really moving ourselves into a position of strength. And with newness, we'll have more newness this year than we did last year. And you don't want to forget about the Disney distortion and toys as well as Nike being in the fourth quarter.OperatorThe next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonI just have a couple for the group here. First, I know that higher private label penetration was an opportunity for the year. So I'm just wondering where that stands now and if your view has changed at all there? And then second, just a quick follow-up on the cost savings question from earlier do you still plan to invest in people and tech in the same way you've outlined last quarter? Or has anything been pared back there on the demand slowdown?Adrian V. MitchellAlex, could you repeat your question on the SG&amp;A or the cost savings, we didn't quite catch it. Our apologies.Alexandra Ann StratonNo problem. The question was just do you still plan to invest in people and tech in the same way that you outlined last quarter or if that's been pared back at all on the demand slowdown?Adrian V. MitchellGot you.Jeffrey GennetteAlex, let me take the private brand, and then Adrian will take the second part of your question. Our ambition on private brands remains the same. So it was 16% of our penetration. We do see that growing over time. And as you've heard us talk about in this particular call about INC and Club Room, which have been brands that have been touched and basically -- they basically have been burnished. So they're performing quite well. And then when you look at what we've got coming, we've got a whole portfolio. We have 24 private brands that are all being touched over the next 2.5 years. So we're in the middle of that right now.So the first brand new one is coming in the summer, and we'll stay tuned on all the details of that, but it is across accessories, it's across women's. It does address those key basics that we're talking about seasonal-based -- seasonless basics. We're actually quite excited about where that will be, and we'll give you a full rundown on that. But we do think that the private brands will raise in penetration in out years and it is why it's one of the big growth factors. -- not only is the -- when you look at the [Mugs] opportunity, the margin opportunity. But really importantly, when you look at the five things that we are doing with private brand, brand identity against customer types, original design, really strong strategic sourcing, relevant size and fit, which is one of the biggest pain points for our customer and, of course, compelling value. So we're very bullish on private brands and look forward to sharing all of those learnings and as we develop those strategies and launch them.Adrian V. MitchellAlex, I think what you're hearing from Tony, Jeff and I today is the importance of navigating the near term in terms of what's in front of us, but not losing sight and clarity about the long term. So in terms of being prudent about what's happening in the current environment and the uncertainty that's out there, we've accelerated the $200 million this year, which will translate to $300 million to $350 million in cost savings next year. We've reduced our capital spend from $1 billion to $950 million in terms of our current projections for this year. The key thing to keep in mind is that we will continue to invest in growth, whether that be tech, whether that be people. So as we move through this uncertain period, we're taking the necessary aggressive actions to protect growth investments that will get us to positive growth and profitable growth in future years. So we'll continue to drive efficiencies in our operating model. We'll continue to invest in the growth vectors, and we'll find ways to be more productive with our assets.OperatorThe next question is coming from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett.Charles P. GromJeff, you talked about flowing product closer to need, and I think that's interesting and important for the business. And I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on that a little bit further and how deep the conversations have been on that front with some of your suppliers?Jeffrey GennetteYes, Chuck. So as I mentioned, when you look at the receipt reserve, that is always available to respond in season. So we're not allocating that in advance. So when we cut back, we went to kind of the upfront cost model versus the MDA model that gave us all of the liquidity that we wanted to build into the system. And that when a customer is signaling something in season, we're able to jump on that. So that is a discipline that has been well honed over the past year that you will see play out for the balance of the year.We did, though, do receive cuts when you look at total to make sure that we retain that liquidity, and we didn't take our full reserve to respond to where we took sales down for the balance of the year. So there were conversations that we had with brands. We see downtrend in categories that are not doing well to ensure that we're able to put the right receipts against those categories that are trending. This is a balanced conversation for us. Every single merchant knows that those receipts are really company assets to serve our customers and not their own.And that has -- expect that discipline to continue with us. So as soon as -- I mean we're ordering every single week based on how things are trending. And as I mentioned, we find there's plenty of inventory in the market to be able to respond to that.Charles P. GromOkay. Helpful. And then from a category perspective, I wonder if you could just elaborate across the board, what you saw in apparel and other areas. And in particular, you called out textiles and top of table and housewares improving which is interesting. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that and what that tells you about trends over the next few quarters in that area.Jeffrey GennetteYes. So what we're seeing right now in apparel is that when you think about the bulk of our drop in the first quarter from our expectations has been in the seasonal categories in men's, women's and kids. So that would be all the spring and early summer content. And again, too early to tell whether or not that is content or whether or not that is environment. So we're working through that right now. But we're going to -- as mentioned, all the pricing that we are taking is to ensure that we have the right number of units going into the third quarter.What's going on in the rest of the business is that you've got pockets of strength in center core. The beauty category continues to be strong across fragrance, color and treatment. You've got the home categories, as you mentioned. Things like textiles has been a real turnaround for us with newness coming, like our [Mugs] opportunity that you're going to see from us in the fourth quarter. The Housewares and the tabletop, they were quite depressed based on coming out of the pandemic and the demand curve there. We're starting to see signs of life there. On our last call, we talked about looking for signs of life there. We started to see that in the first quarter. We really see it in the Bloomingdale's brand right now where the home business is quite robust. We're starting to see signs of that in -- on the Macy's side. So again, when you look at the overall categories, I think to a comment that Adrian made to Paul Lejuez' question earlier, what you need to look at is look at the categories and how they penetrate in each quarter. So this idea about beauty and gifting being our two strengths that are trending positively in the first quarter and having a much higher penetration of those in the fourth quarter is our confidence in where we completely de-risked our plan for what we know today with our customers today for the back half of the year. And we feel like our guide is appropriate and conservative for what we see in the customer underpinning.OperatorWe're showing time for one final question today. The final question is coming from Jay Sole of UBS.Jay Daniel SoleI wanted to ask about this new Nike partnership. Maybe can you just tell us a little bit about how that partnership came together? And maybe how big was NIKE as a percent of sales back the last time Macy’'s had it? And do you expect this to be like a long-term partnership? Or is this getting inventory for a couple of quarters and then sort of we'll see from there?Jeffrey GennetteLong-term partnership. So I look at it as we took a pause. We've been out of the Nike brand outside of where we are in footwear and certain license businesses in the kids really for the last 1.5 years. And we're committing to a long-term partnership together and our opportunity to basically provide our customer a multi-brand or a multi-category experience that is elevated and enhanced. And so we're not quoting what we used to do, but obviously, it's one of the most important brands for our customer.We had lots of customers that were disappointed that we didn't carry it over the past year. So this is very important to uniform for many of our customers. It gives [heft] to the balance of our active assortments. We're excited about things like our Reebok engagement, obviously, what we're doing with the other brands. This is going to be, we believe, a real catalyst without cannibalizing much else in the balance of the apparel assortments. So this is a win for us. And we think it's a win for Nike.When you look at our 40 million-plus customers that come to us for curation across multi-categories and wanting Nike. So those are the conversations that we had with Nike Management on the pause that we took. So you're going to see it come in, in the month of October. You have it in apparel, that's including plus size women's, it's big and tall men's -- it's the kids area that we weren't carrying it through the licensed areas. It's badge, It's gear. It's going to be in key locations, obviously, online and then expands out to many, many more locations as we get into '24. Our finish line business has been quite strong, and so that will continue in all the doors that we have in today.OperatorThank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gannette for closing comments.Jeffrey GennetteJust thank you, everybody, for your interest in Macy's, and everybody, have a great summer. Look forward to talking to you again in August with our first -- with our second quarter results.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.]"

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with our results for the first quarter, which demonstrates the strength of the Lands' End brand and deep customer affinity, the value of our core offerings and our company-wide focus on stellar execution. We generated revenues of $310 million at the high end of our expectations and adjusted EBITDA of $19.5 million, well exceeding our guidance.I'll provide more commentary on our strong first quarter in a moment. But first, I want to focus on the progress we're seeing from our strategic initiatives that I shared with you last quarter, and the work we continue to do to enhance value for our customers, employees and shareholders. As you know, I believe Lands' End has a tremendous opportunity ahead and we are well positioned to generate value for all our stakeholders to achieve that value creation, we are taking a page from our iconic brand's 60-year history, deepening our customer focus and ensuring that we're providing our customers and partners with the high-quality products they are looking for.In just a few short months, we're seeing progress as our renewed focus on our customers and prioritization of core products is driving tangible results. To be clear, we shared last quarter that Swim was performing well and that it is a priority for us alongside its natural vacation adjacencies like totes, towels and cover-ups. Year-over-year, our Swim business is up high single digits. And the NPD scores we're seeing in our women's swim business show that we have the leading brand in the swim category and they're a top gainer of market share.What's exciting for us and gives us confidence in the path we are pursuing is that customers are responding well to newness. We've taken steps to rightsized our inventory, which enables us to run more targeted promotions and leverage cost tailwinds that support our gross margin expansion with swim and vacation as our template informed by insights from our bar file and broader consumer trends we believe we can replicate this strategy in other categories and in particular, those categories that our customers are looking for and that drive outsized value creation.The key attributes of swim fit performance and functionality are also present in other categories like bottoms and outerwear, which each have franchise items and where we have authority in the marketplace. Underpinning this strategy is bringing innovation back to Lands' End, innovation and how we more deeply engage with our customers, innovation and how we look critically at our product strategy and innovation in how we better execute. While innovation is a key value driver for us. We will do so consistent with our 60-year legacy, which is appreciated by customers across the country and around the world.At its core, Lands' End is a solutions company. We are in the business of providing products that solve lives issues by obsessing about our customers' needs we can better plan for, anticipate and prepare for the many avenues where we can serve them. We can and will continue to execute from a position of strength, knowing that we are uniquely positioned to deliver consumers and our partners, high-quality products they're looking for themselves, their families and their businesses and associates. We also believe there's an opportunity to create value by pursuing a licensing strategy that enables Lands' End to do what we do best, or bringing in partners that can leverage their own strengths.Since our last call, we have brought on a new partner to supply Lands' End products to Costco, and we are actively considering category, channel and geographic licenses with others. The potential for us to utilize this asset-light model enables us to free up our resources and better focus on our solution-driven authority in areas that are significant value drivers for Lands' End between asset-light balance sheet gains, royalties, and increased brand visibility from multichannel distribution, we see the potential for a significant source of incremental profitability, coupled with an improvement in operating margins.On our last quarterly call, we spoke to you about the work we're doing to better leverage our strong buyer file and the proprietary data it provides us that we can use to inform our decision-making. For the quarter, our U.S. buyer file stabilized with flat growth, and we saw strength in the rebuy rates of our active customers. We're continuing to conduct qualitative and quantitative reviews of our data to refine our strategy so that we can better reach and cater to the needs of our existing customers and expand our customer base over time.We've already started rolling out the learnings of this work and have seen positive results. For example, we're weighing our marketing of the swim and vacation stories more heavily on Instagram, where we can broaden our customer base and reach a younger audience that recognizes Lands' End as an authority in the category. We'll continue to roll out additional updates to our strategy and marketing as that process continues. We're also working to further improve our operations and better leverage our data to enhance efficiency through greater collaboration and faster decision-making. Our goal is to be the nimble problem solvers that our customers demand, and we're doing that by empowering our team with the information, tools and processes to provide differentiated value for our customers, which should lead to improved operating results and enhanced value creation for our shareholders.Now turning back to our strong first quarter results. Building on what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer activity continued to progress during the quarter, resulting in strong momentum across the business. In the first quarter, our sales came in at the high end of our guidance range with $310 million in revenue, a 2% increase year-over-year.Importantly, we capitalized on supply chain cost improvements and utilize more targeted promotions, which resulted in strong year-over-year margin performance. Regarding inventory, we continue to make progress and are pleased to report that as of the end of Q1, we have returned to normalized inventory levels consistent with what we said last quarter. As a result of our work to better match anticipated demand with supply, which is largely informed by our proprietary data, we expect that inventory levels will continue to come down and that by the end of Q2 we will be at or below pre-pandemic levels, supporting our ability to lean into gross margin opportunities.Critical to our improved inventory levels is a focus on driving terms, increasing our freshness factor and leveraging our vendor relationships. We did not and will not accept that a return to normalized supply chains is enough. Our go-forward stance is to reduce the time to market. Already for fall holiday inventories, we have removed as much as 9 weeks from the calendar and implemented vendor-managed inventories on a handful of core net programs with a view to expanding that strategy.Now taking a look at our products and what our customers are responding to, the underlying theme is that the trends towards casualization and hybrid life appear to be sustaining. We, of course, reference swim as a leading category we've surrounded that with other vacation essentials that our customers are responding exceptionally well too. We've also seen good momentum in linen and core knit tops as well as seasonally appropriate attire like long sleeve T-shirts and woven tops for both men and women.Bottoms for both men and women performed well. And in our experience, that bodes well for sales of tops. Lastly, and this is a critical point, as I mentioned earlier, customers are responding well to the overall newness in our assortment. As we move forward, we are committed to regularly injecting newness into our offerings throughout seasons and across categories.Turning to the Outfitters business. As I've said before, this is a successful business with plenty of opportunity ahead. Both on its own and as a potential customer acquisition engine for our consumer business. Recently, we signed a 5-year extension with American Airlines, which takes that agreement to 2028. As we expected and reflected in the guidance we provided on our last quarterly call, we wrapped up our work with Delta during the quarter, resulting in some nonrecurring revenue, which Bernie will detail shortly.In addition, we have hired a new leader for the Outfitters business, Jim O'Connor. He will be joining Lands' End in June. Jim brings over 20 years of general management and sales leadership expertise in B2B and B2C businesses, including at Shoes For Crews and Timberland. I'm confident Jim will be a great addition to our leadership team as we continue our focus on driving and expanding the Outfitters business. We are a digitally native business, serving our customers across a variety of online venues from landsend.com to Amazon to department store marketplaces.As over 90% of Lands' End purchases happen with a click, we're pleased with our online performance and in particular, landsend.com. Our Lands' End fulfill business which enables us to sell through our partners', online marketplaces and deliver direct from our warehouse provides a valuable opportunity to reach additional customers not engaging directly with our brand. This business continues to demonstrate growth and provide strong margins. We see significant opportunity in our newer partners, including Target and our most recent addition, Macy's, which we launched this quarter.Increasingly, we view this business as an integral part of our domestic B2C digital journey, which combines produced mid-single-digit growth for the quarter. We'll continue to explore opportunities to leverage this program platform with new and existing partners and speak increasingly about the growth of the consumer digital journey.Lastly, from my vantage point, our international business is an opportunity for us to grow demand and earnings faster than our core U.S. business, tapping a customer that is excited about the lifestyle we offer and the value we bring. We're exploring various opportunities to expose our products in new geographies, including through online expansion, distribution partners, and as I mentioned earlier, license fees. In our existing Europe business, we are reacting to ongoing lower levels of consumer demand in the region by applying much of the approach that has been critical to our success in the U.S. This includes a focus on key categories where we have authority in Europe, particularly linen and dresses and incorporating newness in the assortment to which customers are responding positively. This approach combines with a deep focus on cost control and more disciplined promotional activity resulted in flat profitability year-on-year and gives us a platform for future growth and development.I'm proud of the way we executed throughout the quarter and the progress we've made on our strategic plans. There's more work ahead, and I look forward to sharing additional updates on our efforts in the coming quarters.With that, I will turn it over to Bernie.Bernard Louis McCrackenThank you, Andrew. For the first quarter, as Andrew mentioned, total revenue performance was at the high end of our guidance range at $310 million, an increase of 2% compared to last year. Our U.S. e-commerce, which represents our largest go-to-market segment saw a sales increase of 2% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by targeted promotions within swim and adjacent product categories. Our Europe e-commerce business in the quarter was down 29%, reflecting the continued lower levels of consumer demand in Europe, as Andrew noted.Globally, e-commerce sales decreased 7% from 2022 or 4% when adjusting for Japan, which closed last year and accounted for $8.5 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2022. Results from our Lands' End Outfitters were strong year-over-year, with revenue up 37% over the first quarter of 2023, which was lifted by the inventory sales to Delta at the anticipated conclusion of their 5-year contract in April. Excluding the $18 million difference in year-over-year revenue from Delta, the Lands' End Outfitters business was up 4%. We continue to be pleased with revenue for our third-party business, which increased 6% as compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by growth in our partners' online marketplaces, as noted, swim was a winning category for us, and that included selling swim inventory through these important partners. We launched our Macy's partnership in the quarter and expect it to contribute to the future strength of our third-party business.Moving to our retail stores, we delivered revenue of $10 million, with U.S. same-store sales increasing approximately 9.5% from the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin in the first quarter increased to 45%, approximately a 210-basis point improvement from 2022. The margin improvement was driven by leveraging our strength in owning the vacation and travel across our channels as well as improvements in supply chain costs. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A was 38%, approximately flat to 2022, driven by lower digital marketing spend, offset by higher employee-related costs. Our performance led to a net loss for the quarter of $1.7 million or $0.05 per share compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.07 per share in 2022.In addition to these GAAP measures, adjusted EBITDA is an important profitability measure that we use to manage our business internally. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased by 41% to $19.5 million, which exceeded the higher end of our expectations. Looking at the balance sheet. Inventories at the end of the quarter were $376 million compared to $437 million a year ago. The 14% decrease in inventory was a result of the actions we took to leverage normalized supply chain in transit times to receive spring and summer inventory closer to the selling season and late receipts last year due to the supply chain challenge.Accordingly, net cash used in operations was $100 million less than last year due to the improved inventory flow. Regarding our debt. At the end of the first quarter, our term loan balance was $241 million and our $275 million ABL had $100 million of borrowings outstanding, which was $25 million lower than last year. As part of our efforts to enhance shareholder value creation, we are continuing to explore opportunities to refinance our debt and are committed to doing so subject to market conditions. During the first quarter, we repurchased $3.8 million worth of shares under the company's previously announced $50 million share repurchase authorization, bringing the balance of the remaining authorization to $38 million as of the end of the quarter.Turning to the second quarter. We expect net revenue to be between $320 million and $335 million. We expect a net loss of $4.5 million to $2 million and diluted loss per share to be between $0.14 and $0.06. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Based on our strong first quarter results, we are updating our full year guidance and now expect net revenue of $1.56 billion to $1.62 billion. We expect net income to be in the range of a net loss of $4.5 million to net income of $2.5 million and diluted loss per share of $0.13 to earnings per share of $0.08. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $75 million to $84 million. Our guidance for the full year incorporates approximately $35 million in capital expenditures.With that, I will turn the call back over to Andrew.Andrew J. McLeanThank you, Bernie. As you've heard me say before, we are taking aggressive achievable actions to improve the business today to drive growth and profitability over time, and our strong first quarter results give us confidence in the strategy we're pursuing. With swim and vacation is our template, we'll continue innovating our product strategy, customer engagement and internal approach to ensure we're building on and staying true to Land's End's history and brand.We also continue to make key hires that are further rounding out our leadership team. In addition to Jim O'Connor, joining us as Senior Vice President and General Manager of Lands' End Outfitters, Stuart Hogue joined Lands' End as SVP U.S. e-commerce in April. Stuart is a digitally savvy leader with more than 20 years of industry experience. He enjoyed a successful career at Nike and joined us from McKinsey, where he advised clients on digital, omnichannel retail and marketing transformation initiatives. With the strength and growth potential for our profitable U.S. direct business, we're pleased to have such a strong leader as Stuart as part of our team. As we execute our strategy and bring innovation across the business, we'll continue to provide updates about how our work is delivering for our customers, employees and shareholders.With that, we look forward to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.And once again, Dana Telsey if you would like to ask your question, please speak now.Dana Lauren TelseyCan you hear me okay?Andrew J. McLeanWe can hear you fine.Dana Lauren TelseySo congratulation on the nice progress. As you think of the swim and vacation related apparel, how's do you see this expanding beyond the purview during the remainder of the year beyond summer? Secondly, on the marketplace initiative that you have, where you're seeing the greatest growth from and how was margins there? And also on the inventory levels, which are brought in nicely, how do you see that going through the rest of the year? And what are you seeing in the promotional landscape?Andrew J. McLeanOkay. Thank you, Dana. Talking to swim and vacation. I mean, we took a view coming into the quarter that we had a leading market share and the best thing to do with a leading market share is defend (inaudible) attack, and we went out and we actually found that we took market share by starting earlier and running longer and then being able to get ourselves into trend faster by being able to pull product through our supply chain faster. So we've been able to react to trends. We used our data to give us a good insight into where the trends were going to go. And we expect that market now will continue to be something that prolongs into the back half.Traditionally, we've wrapped up swim in the June, July time frame. We now expect to see that continue on into late summer and to all intents and purposes, be part of a year-round business for us particularly given what we saw in the fourth quarter with some of our swim sales. Where vacation goes is we're going to continue to evolve it. So vacation for us will evolve into the back half of the year. And we'll pick up at somewhere. We have a strong market share position in outerwear. And largely, our intention is to do with outerwears what we've done with swim and we feel really strong about the product that we put behind that.What we're seeing is it expands having vacation and having this ownership and having these solutions, we're able to expand beyond that. So we've seen ownership in our bottoms business, which we called out on the call, been really strong, and we're seeing trends, particularly wide lag, particularly knits that are long lasting and enduring for us. We knew early it wasn't going to be a denim cycle. We actively managed our inventory around that. And we're able to like lean into knit bottoms. We've made them part of the vacation solutions. For us vacation could be walk in the dog, it can be a staycation. There can be -- it's about your lifestyle, it's about a state of mind. And so it's about evolving those categories to have authorities and might really back up what we're doing in that marketplace.I'll take the marketplace as the next question, and then I'm going to let Bernie answer on inventory. We're really very happy with where we're going with the marketplace. I said it on the call, I view that as just part of our domestic consumer digital journey. And if I look at Lands' End fulfill product for the marketplaces along with Lands' End along with Amazon. That was a mid-single-digit growth for us. And when you put it all together and we see consistency in the journey, but we see opportunities. So I actually like lost my words for a minute. We actually see opportunities to stratify product strategies against the Target, against the Macy's, against the Amazon.So Amazon, for example, would be more about basics. And then I think as we build it out from there, we're finding a new customer and by offering them a certain profile on that marketplace and then being able to expand the offering. With landsend.com, we bring them from the marketplace to the main site. It's like we see the growth, and it helps us to pick up customers. I would say that the margins for the Lands' End fulfill business continue to please us and it's the side of the business that we feel strongest about versus the wholesale doors. It just leverages the inventory that we own. We're not buying specifically for it and becomes a merchandising strategy that allows us to leverage a single inventory. Turning to inventory, Bernie?Bernard Louis McCrackenThanks, Andrew. Yes. So inventory, the transportation has stabilized for us on the inbound and we've really taken advantage of that. The team's worked very hard to get our inventory flows aligned with our selling periods. And we are now going to be able to keep our inventories down mid-double digits in that 15% range for the rest of the year on the quarters. We are -- as far as the promotional business, it is definitely a very promotional market still, where we found strength is in newness, as Andrew has noted. And that is where we are going to lean in and try to drive our higher margin business and know that there are other products, we will have to join the rest of the promotional industry and have to go into a discount to liquidate that inventory. But from a total inventory standpoint, we feel very good about our inventory levels and our normal -- and will be at normalized levels for the rest of the year.Andrew J. McLeanDana, just to add to that, as like we want -- we're determined to drive a turn up and keep that freshness at much higher and I think that traditionally, we've got a cataloging background. We were one of the original catalogers, and in fact we would bring in a lot of inventory set at the beginning of the season and let it run down. So it starts to get a little stale as you get towards the end of the season. In fact, we're going to and are progressively bringing in the inventory in shots and matching it better against the revenue. It's better for cash flow. It's better for freshness. It's better for markdowns. There's just a whole lot of advantages to it. But as we move forward, you'll see the business run that way. And it will come through materially in margins for us, and you'll see it reflected in turns as well as we're able to keep that inventory better matched to the revenue profile.Dana Lauren TelseyGot it. And just one follow-up. With the better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA uptick from the prior guidance, the main driver of that is that on the gross margin side, the SG&amp;A side? How do we unpack that in terms of the levers?Bernard Louis McCrackenYes, Dana, it's driven by gross margin. And our improvements in -- as you have heard from most of our industry, transportation costs are down and we're benefiting from that. And we also see continued improvement in our average unit cost of our product coming in, and we see real tailwinds in our lower cost and our ability to drive those lower costs through, as Andrew said, the timing and have it at the right times.Andrew J. McLeanYes. I mean one of the opportunities Dana as we speed our [churn] it looks like we're sitting on less inventory progressively from last year at a higher cost. And so we see that as a tailwind that we can take forward for some considerable period of time.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.Alex Joseph FuhrmanNice to speak with you. Congratulations on a really nice start to the year here. Let's see, Dana didn't leave a whole lot to ask about. But maybe just to start from a high level here. A lot of other retailers have been talking about just seeing demand soften over the last month or 2? Obviously, it doesn't sound like you're seeing that with a really strong guidance for the year. Is there anything you have noticed lately in terms of maybe basket size or customer acquisition costs that would kind of be indicative of that? Or has it really just been kind of steady as she goes here for your customer over since the last update?Andrew J. McLeanI mean, overall, Alex, it's been pretty steady. But I mean, as you can imagine, and I know you're a keen watcher of our site. It's just like it's choppy. Every day is a little different, and we're thinking more -- we think a lot more about how to reach our customers across the various channels from Macy's to Target, to Amazon to landsend.com and how we're -- how we're best in the position for them. And I think that we're doing a better job as a company working out how to address our customers in those channels. So for example, we're reaching a much younger consumer with our swim business, and we're able to do that via Instagram. I don't know if you noticed, but we made the Instagram site shoppable and that's become a viable place to acquire new customers. And we've seen about a 10% lift in the number of followers that we're getting off Instagram. And I just called that as an example because it's one that's probably shown the most change and it's probably the easiest to track. So we're being more thoughtful about the levers that we pull within the channels that we operate and viewing them as one digital enterprise rather than a series of silos where we think about Macy's differently, where we think about Amazon differently, we're actually connected the dots between them all and are able to amplify that and get leverage across the business. So I think you're seeing more of that coming through. And that, along with everything we talked to Dana about it gives us some running as we get through the rest of the year.Alex Joseph FuhrmanOkay. That's really helpful. And then Andrew, I thought it was interesting the commentary about licensing. I feel like that's something we've seen kind of some efforts that never really got off the ground, several CEOs ago in that area. Can you give us a little bit more insight into how those talks have progressed and what categories you might be looking to license?Andrew J. McLeanSo yes, sure, it's a good question. For us, it's very important that we maintain a stance as a family variety retailer. We've always been that. It's been our heritage. We're going to stay with that at $1.6 billion, we can't be putting all of our eggs in one basket. We've got this resource that we're spreading across a lot of categories and a lot of geographies. And for us, we view licensing as an opportunity to still remain really competitive in categories or channels or geographies that we wouldn't otherwise be able to show up in a way that we were completely proud of. And at the same time, it allows us to take that resource and position it behind things where we know we can really, really set ourselves apart like swim or light bottoms or like outerwear.So it's more about where we want to invest our next dollar ourselves and then look for partners to really support the growth of the business. And I would say to you, it's going to be the lesser categories or the noncore categories and geographies and channels that we haven't necessarily got to. We're in conversations geographically to take the business into places like Latin America or into the Middle East. We couldn't possibly go in there ourselves. We don't have that expertise to get in there, but we recognize from our digital sales that there's demand that we can capture. And so having that partner in place really helps us. And again, I mean, you can do the math on it. It really -- it's a great opportunity for us to build our margins and build our expansion and demand much quicker than we could sort of organically just given some of the constraints we face.Alex Joseph FuhrmanOkay. That's really helpful. And congratulations again on the great start to the year.Andrew J. McLeanYes, thank. Appreciate it.OperatorAnd there are no more questions at this time. That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. you may now disconnect.]"

On Friday, all eyes will be on the May jobs report. Economists are expecting 195,000 jobs were added last month.Video Transcript- Closing time here at Yahoo Finance, here's a look at some of the top stories of the day. Optimism on Wall Street after the House passed the debt ceiling bill. Investors taking off June to the upside. The Dow closing higher by half of 1%. The S&amp;P 500 was up just shy of 1%. And no surprise here, the NASDAQ was the top performer-- performer of the day.But now the debt ceiling deal may face a delay in the Senate as some senators call for more defense spending.SEANA SMITH: Some of the top movers of the day were in retail. Dollar General down nearly 20%. The company missing estimates and slashing its guidance. On the flip side, Macy's shares closed the day, higher earnings beat expectations. But the outlook did come in below the Street's expectations.And the focus for Wall Street tomorrow, the May jobs report. The expectation is for 195,000 jobs added in the unemployment rate to edge higher at 3.5%. It will be closely watched, especially ahead of the Fed decision later this month.SEANA SMITH: Certainly, we'll have that for you live right here at Yahoo Finance, 8:30 AM Eastern time.]"

Shifting to the auto industry, EV maker Lucid's stock dropped after announcing a new stock offering. On the AI front, C3.ai shares plunged after the company issued a disappointing outlook.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Look at some of those individual movers. Well, Macy's closing the day slightly in the green, looking at gains of just about 1%, despite reporting results that did miss some expectations. The retailer also slashing its full year outlook amid growing concerns about the consumer.Dollar General shares sliding there on the day as they also lowered their full-year forecast for both sales and earnings. Earnings per share now projected to decline as much as 8% on the year. Looking at losses of just about 20%. So clearly, consumers pulling back here.But I also want to highlight what we saw play out with Nordstrom today because that was a bright spot in retail. And now it's very important to put this all in context. Clearly Nordstrom has been struggling now for quite some time. But when it comes to their results, they actually did relatively well. Shares closing up nearly about 5% today.And looking at these results here, better than expected first quarter earnings, held its full year outlook despite what some of those executives said with it being a very uncertain and challenging macroeconomic backdrop.- I think they're able to sort of better manage their inventory there. Their focused on a more of a higher end consumer. Maybe that has something to do with it as well. But I think it's more about that inventory management control.Also, the Nordstrom Rack business, focusing more on that, I know a lot of people, including my mom who are big fans of that business.SEANA SMITH: I'm one of them.- I mean, I shouldn't say me too as well. So I think they have the right kind of mix there for that for what's going to happen with the consumer down the line. Obviously, these lower-- lower low income names like Dollar General, Dollar Tree kind of hurting right now, as people go to Walmart and places like that so.Story continuesAlso, I'm thinking here watching Lucid stocks sliding today after the EV maker announced another stock offering worth $3 billion via private placement, an affiliate of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. Now, the Saudis already own 60% of the company before this move. So it wasn't that unexpected that they would raise money from them.And people had expected that they would probably need more money because they probably have I think enough money to go through 2023, 2024, as they ramp up their new vehicles, the Gravity SUV, things like that. So not surprising there.But I think for investors it's still a concern that these pure play non-legacy EV makers need so much cash to just keep going to compete with Tesla, compete with Ford and GM. It's going to be a long road ahead for them, but they have the right product.SEANA SMITH: Very long road ahead for them. And also the consensus out here on the Street that maybe this fundraising really reduces those expectations that Lucid could potentially go private at least in the near term. Morgan Stanley was out making some comments on the heels of this news, saying that the ability to access such a substantial amount of equity financing is unique.Also, provides just greater time in order for Lucid to really explore some of the changes to their business that they need to make. Also, their cash position strategy required to potentially keep moving forward.But you mentioned the fact that the company has been struggling so much. I think a lot of investors are just trying to figure out what exactly the future does look like here for Lucid.Let's also take a look at one of the AI movers on the move today. It's really been on the move here for this year. But C3 AI reported its fourth quarter earnings last night after the bell. And despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom line, shares plunged today as the company's full year revenue outlook came in shy of Wall Street's expectations.This comes after a massive, massive run off in the stock price since January 1st. But shares plunging their 2024 revenue forecast on the lighter side of what the Street was looking for. And that was enough to send shares down significantly lower today.- Yeah, we're just seeing today the stock up 250% this year alone. So any little chance investors could take to sell this stock after a huge run up, I think they took it, and they were able to kind of do that as your catalyst for that big downdraft there.I'm not an AI expert, but I feel like maybe there's more sort of juice behind the AI hardware plays like Nvidia and Marvell, as opposed to the software plays, which is sort of dominated by Google, Microsoft, and, of course, OpenAI, things like that. So I think maybe that's sort of what's going on here at play is more of a valuation, kind of, let's make take some money off the table right now.]"

Merchandise margins were flat, gaining from lean beginning-of-year inventory levels and reduced clearance markdowns, compensated by promotions and category mix shifts. Delivery expenses, as a rate of net sales, were 40 basis points higher than the year-ago fiscal period, owing to improvements in the company’s contracted carrier rates, lower packages per order and a 1-percentage point fall in digital penetration year over year.As a percentage of net sales, selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 350 basis points year over year to 37.7%.

M’s inventories were 7% lower than fiscal 2022.During first-quarter fiscal 2023, Macy’s provided cash by operating activities of $105 million.A Sneak Peek of GuidanceManagement is taking a cautious approach for the rest of the fiscal year and is thus lowering its annual sales and earnings view to reflect the expected macroeconomic impacts. On the low end, the revised guidance assumes macro pressures on the consumers. The high end assumes the persistence of increasing macro pressures.The new earnings guidance also consists of gains from an incremental $200 million cost savings, which is likely to impact the gross margin and SG&amp;A expenses. Net sales are now projected to be $22.8-$23.2 billion, down from the prior view of $23.7-$24.2 billion. Comparable owned plus licensed sales on a 52-week basis are expected to decline 6-7.5% versus the prior view of a 2-4% decrease year over year.Adjusted earnings per share are envisioned in the bracket of $2.70-$3.20 for the fiscal year, down from $3.67-$4.11 expected earlier and $4.48 earned in the last fiscal year.Solid Picks in RetailWe have highlighted three top-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, American Eagle Outfitters AEO and Hibbett Sports HIBB.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a leading casual apparel retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this casino operator have returned -9.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Gaming industry, which Wynn falls in, has lost 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wynn is expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share, indicating a change of +137.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +206.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.70 points to a change of +138% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +61.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.87 indicates a change of +186.6% from what Wynn is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Wynn is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WYNN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Wynn, the consensus sales estimate of $1.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +62.4%. The $6.01 billion and $6.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +59.9% and +12.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWynn reported revenues of $1.42 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.3%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with -$1.21 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.5%. The EPS surprise was +261.11%.Over the last four quarters, Wynn surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wynn is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wynn. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

143,1c458feb-21e9-3af1-b624-9b698e8cbb6d,NEE,2023-06-02,2 Great Large Cap Stocks to Buy On Sale in June,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-great-large-cap-stocks-210500163.html,1685653500,STORY,"['NEE', 'HD', '^GSPC']","[There are plenty of fantastic large-cap stocks on sale right now that long-term investors might want to start buying in June and beyond.  With the debt-ceiling deal almost done, Wall Street could begin to focus more on the fact that the stellar 2023 performances of Nvidia, Meta, and the other biggest tech companies on the planet have papered over the rather mundane showing from most of the S&amp;P 500. Investors who can stomach the possibility of more near-term downside should start looking around for all the deals out there in the market right now.The best investors don’t need to try to call bottoms on individual stocks. Instead, investors with long-term horizons should search for proven companies trading at rather attractive levels by their own historical standards.Some of the best times to buy established giants are when they are seemingly ice cold. Investors are often bullish to buy stocks at what might soon prove to be the near-term peaks and very nervous to buy strong stocks at levels that will likely look ‘cheap’ years from now.Here are two large-cap stocks that have more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the past 20 years that boast proven business models that should thrive for years to come. Both stocks are also trading at prices and valuations that make them potentially attractive long-term buys right now.  NextEra Energy (NEE)NextEra Energy operates one of the largest electric utilities, Florida Power &amp; Light Company, in the U.S., which services over 12 million people. NEE is also one of the biggest producers of wind and solar energy on the planet. NextEra is a battery storage leader as well, and it is exposed to the potential long-term upside of nuclear power. The company combines the huge growth potential of renewable energy and the stability of an electric utility.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNEE boasts a roughly $150 billion market cap and it is the largest holding in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU). NextEra expanded its contracted renewables and storage backlog in the first quarter to boost its total backlog to roughly 20.4 gigawatts. Story continuesNEE reaffirmed both its 2023 earnings guidance and its long-term financial outlook, which includes strong bottom-line expansion and dividend growth. NextEra’s dividend currently yields 2.6% and it has raised its payout by an average of 11% annually over the past five years.NextEra’s revenue is projected to grow by 26% in FY23 to $26.48 billion and then climb 8% higher next year to help boost its bottom line by 7% and 9%, respectively, based on Zacks estimates. NEE’s FY24 earnings outlook has risen steadily since early 2022 and it has consistently topped our EPS estimates in recent years. Plus, nine of the 13 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for NEE are “Strong Buys,” with no “Sells.” Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNEE stock has climbed by 270% in the past decade and 770% in the last 20 years, with a total return of roughly 1,500% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 330% run over the last 20 years and 575% total return. This outperformance includes over two years of recent sluggishness, highlighted by some big up and down moves. NextEra currently trades around where it was in September of 2020 and over 20% below its records.The downturn has NEE trading 33% beneath its highs at 22.8X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its decade-long median. NextEra is flirting with some potentially worrisome technical levels. But it could be poised to break out of its slump at some point and possibly reward investors who are thinking about holding the stock for year and years to come. NextEra currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Home Depot (HD) Home Depot stock has fallen around 30% from its records as Wall Street began to price in slowing demand after the pandemic home building and improvement spending bonanza. The home improvement power posted 20% revenue growth in FY20 and over 14% higher sales in FY21 vs. an average of around 6% top-line growth during the five prior years. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings surged by around 17% and 29%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHome Depot was never going to be able to keep up that scorching pace as the economy returned closer to normal. Yet sales still popped 4% in 2022 to help boost by adjusted earnings by 7%. Home Depot then provided somewhat disappointing fiscal 2023 guidance when it reported its Q1 results on May 16.In fact, HD warned that its annual sales would fall for the first time since 2009. Zacks estimates call for Home Depot’s revenue to slip by 3.5% from $157 billion to around $152 billion and then pop 2% to $155 billion in FY24. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to slip by 10% in 2023 and then bounce back to the tune of a 7% gain next year.Home Depot’s longer-term outlook remains intact since Millennials are now driving the housing market and Baby Boomers are finally retiring and moving. Plus, home builders didn’t overbuild during the covid boom, which means there is plenty of upside. And the average home in the U.S. is growing older, likely leading to more repairs and remodels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHome Depot lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now and its earnings outlook for FY24 is only down by around 5% since its Q1 report. Fourteen of the 24 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for HD are “Strong Buys,” with no sell ratings. And its Building Products – Retail space lands in the top 7% of over 250 Zacks industries. Home Depot’s dividend yields 2.9% at the moment and it has raised its payout by 15% on an annualized basis over the past five years.HD shares have climbed around 266% in the last decade and 1,100% in the past 15 years to blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 240% 15-year move and its Zacks Econ Sector’s 300%. Home Depot is currently neck-and-neck with the benchmark in the trailing five years, with it down 8% in the past two. HD stock is trading around where it was in the summer of 2020. Home Depot is also trading at an 8% discount to its own 10-year median at 18.5X forward 12-month earnings.(Disclosure: Ben Rains owns NEE in the Zacks Alternative Energy Innovators service) Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since then, the cardholders denote the most loyal clients of JTV in terms of growing purchase volumes and Customer Lifetime Value, thereby creating a base for the tie-up renewal.The expanded alliance concentrates on the digitization of payment solutions and leveraging data analytics to bring about increased personalization for customers. SYF will provide an opportunity for JTV consumers to seek credit and financing prior to purchase and hence, grasp an idea of their affordability.  In addition to this, a real-time pre-approval can be received instantly by JTV consumers while shopping without any effect on their credit score.The benefits of the renewed tie-up can be reaped by clients who will indulge in purchases with JTV either through its online business or through television broadcasts of the jewelry retailer.In addition to the recently infused benefits, the JTV Preferred Account credit card comprises other notable benefits as well. Cardholders do not have to bear an annual card fee. An acquisition bonus awaits when a consumer uses their JTV Preferred Account. Cardholders are liable to pay no interest if the promotional balance is repaid in full within a year, provided the purchases are worth $299 or more. Further, special Preferred Account offers remain in store the entire year.The recent initiative reinforces Synchrony Financial’s efforts to solidify ties with JTV since the latter has widespread reach to millions of American households. Additionally, the partnership expansion bears testament to SYF’s efforts to broaden consumer payment choices, widen credit accessibility, cement solid customer relationships, fetch new clients and bring increased repeat sales.Story continuesThis, in turn, is likely to bolster the revenue base of Synchrony Financial since it derives most of its revenues from extending credit products in accordance with program agreements with partners.SYF is likely to establish a robust foothold across the jewelry marketplace through the latest tie-up renewal. It is steadily pursuing a series of acquisitions and renewal of alliances with several payment solutions partners throughout the United States to broaden and diversify its portfolio. The list of SYF’s partners is perpetually increasing, with more than 15 partners being added or relationships being renewed in the first quarter of 2023.Shares of Synchrony Financial have lost 14.5% in a year compared with the industry’s 19% decline.

Our approach is explained in further detail in our Human Rights Statement.We require all employees to complete training and certification on The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct, including the subsection on human rights.As part of our human rights due diligence efforts, we regularly conduct formal, third-party human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) of our operations as a whole or at the market level. These assess potential risks across our operations and/or value chain, including risks related to employees, manufacturing facilities, supply chain and communities. HRIAs help us identify our salient human rights issues - those human rights at potential risk of negative impact due to our Company activities or business relationships.Because we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing, assembly and most of the testing of our semiconductor products, we do not generally encounter issues with child labor, forced labor or human trafficking in our direct operations. Indirect salient human rights risks exist primarily in our supply chains and with local community members. Although we may not have direct control over or causal relationships with these risks, we are committed to raising awareness of our expectations and working toward mitigating any potential link or contribution to these risks.Story continuesDue to our reliance on suppliers, our Company has taken specific steps to prevent human rights abuses in our supply chain through our engagement with the RBA. Our efforts to prevent, mitigate and remediate our human rights risks and impacts in our supply chain include annual assessments of suppliers' operations in accordance with the RBA SAQ, engagement with suppliers to ensure conformance to our expectations, risk-based onsite audits and participation in multi-stakeholder initiatives.As previously discussed, we require our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA SAQ, which includes human rights risks, such as working hours, child labor, freedom of association and more. All our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers comply with this requirement, and all have low-risk manufacturing facilities according to the SAQ ratings. In addition, we encourage our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete an RBA Validated Assessment Process (VAP) audit.During VAP audits, certified third-party auditors conduct record reviews, manager interviews and worker interviews for conformance to all standards of the RBA Code of Conduct covering labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. For more information on the VAP, please see the RBA VAP guidance documents.Our internal Human Rights Working Group focuses on strengthening our management of human rights risks. This cross-functional team includes representatives from departments including Legal, Procurement, Corporate Responsibility, Government Affairs, Environment, Health and Safety, Security, DEI, Supply Chain, Risk and Compliance, Privacy and Cybersecurity. The working group is responsible for implementing, improving and supporting adherence to our human rights practices and for engaging external stakeholders on our human rights approach.We are committed to providing remedies for individuals or communities where we have identified that our Company or third parties acting on our behalf caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $200 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure critical long lead material and associated efforts to support maintenance of the full rate production timeline for the congressionally added F/A-18E/F aircraft.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in El Segundo, CA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.46%.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 7.2% improvement from the previous year’s reported figure.Price Movement and Zacks RankShares of Boeing have risen 48.1% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

152,dcefbc5b-4f1b-3f9f-9842-771a8eafa464,PHM,2023-06-02,"‘House Prices Are Set to Plunge,’ According to Elon Musk, but Deutsche Bank Smells Opportunity in These Homebuilder Stocks",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/house-prices-set-plunge-according-171653560.html,1685639813,STORY,"['DBK.DE', 'DHI', 'PHM', 'MTH']","[The housing market has long been one of the major supports of the US economy. More than a decade of low interest rates made mortgages more affordable, in both the residential and commercial markets, and real estate properties were considered solid investments. But is that changing?The real estate landscape is definitely shifting and has been for the past year. The Federal Reserve’s tighter monetary policy and significantly higher interest rates – all in the service of tackling inflation – are increasing mortgage costs, making homes less affordable.In the eyes of Elon Musk, this represents a real problem on the horizon, which he has described as the “most serious looming issue.”“The massive jump in monthly payments for a 30-year mortgage, due to significantly higher interest rates, obviously greatly reduces home affordability. Mortgage portfolios are at risk if housing prices drop significantly,” Musk added.On the other hand, taking a controversial stance, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer has become decisively bullish on new residential construction.“Optimism was palpable in January around new resi, and this has been largely substantiated by company outlooks and homebuilder results and commentary through the first five months of the year,” Ahlersmeyer explained.Against this backdrop, Ahlersmeyer has been pointing out homebuilder stocks that investors should consider now. Here are the details on three of his top picks.DR Horton (DHI)The first Deutsche Bank pick is DR Horton, the Texas-based construction firm that leads the pack in the US homebuilding sector. By business volume, DHI is the nation’s largest homebuilder, and has held that position for over 20 years now. The company operates in 33 states and 110 residential markets, and builds multi-family apartment complexes as well as single-family homes.In the single-family home market, DHI operates in every income bracket, building smaller, low-end homes priced near $150,000 and working up to mansions for $1 million or more. DR Horton has subsidiaries to back up its core homebuilding business; these companies provide vital homebuyer services such as mortgage financing, title services, and home insurance.Story continuesA look at DR Horton has to start with the share performance. DHI stock has outperformed the broader markets in the past year, and by a wide margin. It’s up some 42% in the past year, compared to just 2% on the S&amp;P 500. Narrowing the focus just to 2023, when the S&amp;P has posted better gains, DHI is still ahead, with a 17% year-to-date gain compared to 10% on the S&amp;P index.This share performance has been backed up by solid financial results. The last reported quarter, the fiscal 2023 second quarter, showed a top line of $8 billion in total revenue. While flat year-over-year, this result beat the analyst forecasts by $1.49 billion. The company’s income was just as strong. DHI reported an EPS figure of $2.73 per diluted share, 82 cents ahead of expectations.These results were based on 19,664 home sale closures during the quarter, for home sale revenues, the core of the company’s business, of $7.4 billion.Looking ahead, DHI has net sales orders for 23,142 homes, to an order value of $8.6 billion. The company has bumped up its fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance into the $31.5 billion to $33 billion range – where analysts had been expected guidance of about $28.5 billion.In his coverage of DHI, Deutsche Bank’s Ahlersmeyer paints an upbeat picture of the firm’s future: “Several years from now, we see DHI with a greater number of Top 3 market positions in the fifty largest markets, possessing higher share in each of those markets as well as higher overall national share, and we also expect stronger volume growth than any other builder under our coverage…. We also see upside to valuation as the company continues to outperform peers in the marketplace and demonstrate sustainably higher returns on inventory and equity.”Ahlersmeyer goes on to rate DHI shares as a Buy, with a $150 price target that suggests a gain of ~39% in the next 12 months. (To watch Ahlersmeyer’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street rates this stock as a Moderate Buy. DHI has 14 recent analyst reviews, with a breakdown of 8 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The current trading price of $108.08 and the average price target of $123.81 combine to give a 14.5% one-year upside potential. (See DHI stock forecast)Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH)The second stock on our list, Meritage, shows that it’s not just the very top US homebuilders who are succeeding in today’s market. Meritage is the fifth largest of the country’s home construction companies, with a significantly smaller market share than DHI above. But, Meritage has still seen its shares grow more than 35% in the past year, and 23% this year along.The company has built this success through 37 years of operations in 9 states. Meritage is known as a leader in building energy-efficient homes, and to date has built some 165,000 houses. In 2021, the company saw total revenues of $5.14 billion; that number grew to $6.29 billion in 2022.A look at the company’s recent 1Q23 results, released at the end of April, shows that Meritage is doing better than the analysts predicted. The firm’s top line revenue figure, of $1.28 billion, slipped one percent y/y but was $245 million ahead of the estimates. The bottom line EPS, of $3.54 per share, was down 39% from the previous year but was 90 cents better than the forecast.On two important positive notes, Meritage reported that the 2,897 home closings it had in Q1, and the nearly $1.3 billion in quarterly home closing revenue, represented company records for a first quarter.In the eyes of Deutsche Bank’s Ahlersmeyer this company deserves a second look from investors. The analyst writes: “We expect Meritage to continue to execute well on its strategy to nearly exclusive build spec-built entry-level homes, and we believe that greater scale and standardization will continue to lead to better margins as well as quicker sales turnover in each community. This should lead to higher returns on inventory, which we believe could settle out in the range of 15%+.”These comments back up Ahlersmeyer’s Buy rating, while his $200 price target implies a robust 70% gain on the one-year time horizon.Overall, MTH has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 4 Buys and 3 Holds set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $117.80, and at $211 the average price target suggests a 79% upside potential. (See MTH stock forecast)PulteGroup (PHM)Wrapping up, we’ll take a look at PulteGroup. This firm, founded in 1950, has since become America’s #3 homebuilder, and can rake in more than $16 billion in annual revenue. PulteGroup has an active presence in over 40 major metropolitan areas, and its assets include ownership of important brand names like Centex, American West, and, of course, Pulte. The company has built more than 800,000 homes in its lifetime.Over its long history, PulteGroup has built a reputation for bringing returns to investors – a trend that has continued in the past year. The company’s 12-month share appreciation is more than 49%, and the shares are up 43% for 2023. PulteGroup has shown consistent year-over-year revenue gains for the past year, despite headwinds in the real estate sector. PulteGroup last year invested some $17 billion into land acquisition – an important point of positioning for a home construction firm.PulteGroup’s current position is solid. The company’s 1Q23 revenues grew 14% year-over-year, to reach $3.58 billion, and came in $310 million ahead of expectations. On earnings, PulteGroup reported $2.35 in non-GAAP EPS, a figure that was 53 cents better than the forecast. Those numbers were backed up by a 6% y/y increase in quarterly home closings, to 6,394. The company saw a 9% increase in the average home price, to $545,000.Looking ahead, PulteGroup has a ‘unit backlog’ of 13,129 homes, valued at approximately $8 billion.Given all of the above, Deutsche Bank’s Joe Ahlersmeyer has high hopes. Along with a Buy rating, he gives PHM a $95 price target, which puts the upside potential at 42%.Backing his stance, Ahlersmeyer writes: “PHM can pull the right growth and returns levers to drive higher TBV/sh, as land investments in recent years underpin the outlook for growth in communities and greater spec sales will drive higher absorptions…. We envision PHM sustaining higher margins, driven once again by efficiency gains and only modestly offset by further mix headwinds from entry level product. PHM should exhibit a smooth transition as strong profitability in backlog flows through while the company puts a floor under returns with increases in specs.”Overall, PulteGroup gets a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 recent reviews that include 9 Buys against 3 Holds. The shares have a current selling price of $66.75, and the average price target of $78.67 implies ~18% increase from that level.

MHO has been riding high, given its diverse markets and product offerings, and strong balance sheet. Importantly, the lack of existing homes for sale and more stabilized mortgage rates have been boosting the confidence of homebuilders. Also, lumber prices have been declining since March 2023, helping companies drive margins to some extent.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have gained 53.1% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 27.3% rally. The stock has fared better than the Zacks Construction sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 12.8% and 10.7% rallies, respectively.The solid price performance was backed by the above-mentioned factors and an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing 13 quarters, with the average surprise being 30%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Earnings estimates for 2023 have moved north to $12.40 per share from $11.12 over the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the company’s prospects. This bullish trend justifies the stock’s addition to investors’ portfolios. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of B. This helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, growth and momentum.Let’s delve into the driving factors.Diverse Offerings: Based in Columbus, OH, M/I Homes is one of the nation's leading builders of single-family homes. The company designs, markets, constructs and sells single-family homes and attached townhomes to first-time, millennial, move-up, empty-nester and luxury buyers under the M/I Homes brand name.Owing to this tailwind, the company has been benefiting, which is reflected in the homes closed. In the first quarter of 2023, homes delivered increased 10% to 2,007 homes. M/I Homes had 200 communities at Mar 31, 2023 compared to 176 communities at Mar 31, 2022.MHO increased first-quarter 2023 revenues by 16% to a record $1 billion, increased pre-tax income by 11% to $136 million and delivered 2,007 homes. In addition, quarterly results reflect a 50-basis point improvement in the overhead expense ratio.Improving Builders’ Sentiment: Builders are now cautiously optimistic for 2023 as the lack of existing inventory is shifting demand to the new home market. Builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes in May inched up five points to 50, according to the National Association of Home Builders /Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. This marks the fifth straight month that builder confidence has increased and is the first time sentiment levels have reached the midpoint mark of 50 since July 2022.Stable Financial Condition: The company ended the quarter with record shareholders' equity of $2.2 billion (increasing 28% year over year), book value of $79 per share, cash of $543 million, zero borrowings on $650 million credit facility, and a homebuilding debt-to-capital ratio of 24%.Higher Return on Equity (ROE): The company’s trailing 12-month ROE is 25.8%, higher than the industry’s 21.4%. This implies that the company is getting less efficient at creating profits and increasing shareholders’ value with respect to its industry.Story continuesOther Top-Ranked Stocks From the Construction SectorMeritage Homes Corporation’s MTH strategic shift to a pure-play entry-level and first-move-up builder is expected to yield higher absorptions, aided by an improving community count growth trajectory.Meritage Homes currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The information was shielded by a protective order in the mass tort litigation meant to prevent disclosure of J&amp;J's trade secrets.""We accordingly find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that (plaintiffs) had, once again, violated the protective orders and in imposing the weighty sanction of dismissal with prejudice,"" Circuit Judge Lara Montecalvo wrote for the panel. Montecalvo was joined by Chief Judge David Barron and Circuit Judge Kermit Lipez.J&amp;J and a lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.J&amp;J's DePuy Orthopaedics Inc unit stopped selling its metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implant devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its regulations on artificial hips.Story continuesThe devices became the subject of more than 10,000 product liability lawsuits consolidated before a federal judge in Texas. After being hit with several adverse jury verdicts, J&amp;J agreed to settle thousands of cases in 2019 for about $1 billion, though some are still pending.Nargol and Langton were serving as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs in that litigation when they sued DePuy under the federal False Claims Act in 2012. They claimed the company marketed the defective hip implant devices to unsuspecting doctors, who were then reimbursed by government health insurance programs.The case is United States ex rel Nargol et al v.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.In the midst of uncertain economic conditions globally, the healthcare sector has displayed a notable degree of resilience. Historically, the demand for healthcare products and services has proven to be relatively inelastic. The healthcare sector’s strength was evident during the equity downturn experienced in 2022 as well, where the sector outperformed broader equity markets. According to BlackRock, healthcare stocks demonstrated 23% less volatility compared to the overall market during the last year. In the past seven recessions, the healthcare sector has consistently surpassed broad market performance by an average margin of 10%. Furthermore, over the span of the last six recessions, earnings within the industry have experienced an average growth of 21%. Some of the best healthcare stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Like many other industries, the healthcare sector underwent significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report released by Deloitte, approximately 70% of the global population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.  As the global economy returns to the new normal and the COVID-19 pandemic moves towards the endemic stage, the healthcare sector is adapting to new trends to shape its future outlook. One notable shift in the industry is the increasing virtualization of care, which has not only transformed the way healthcare services are delivered but has also attracted new players in the industry. For instance, in 2021, the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente jointly invested $110 million into Medically Home Group, a venture company focused on hospital-at-home services.Story continuesIndustry's Growth TrajectoryThe delivery of healthcare services is no longer restricted to healthcare companies only, but leading technology and retail companies are now making a play at it as well. In November 2021, leading electronics retailer Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) invested $400 million to acquire the care-at-home platform Current Health. Meanwhile, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also partnered with Zimmer Biomet to develop remote sensors that could be installed in smartphones and smartwatches and used to track the recovery of patients following their knee replacement surgery. As per Deloitte, the remote monitoring devices segment is expected to gain more mainstream attention as its size is forecasted to increase from $30 billion in 2021 to $101 billion in 2028. This reflects an annual average growth rate of 18.9%.The overall demand for the healthcare sector can be gauged by the fact that one in three adults across the world has chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as of 2023. Meanwhile, one in every four individuals is expected to experience a form of mental illness during their life. According to Deloitte, over a period of 20 years, the world is expected to face an economic loss of $16.3 trillion due to mental illnesses. However, despite the rising demand for healthcare services, the sector’s ability to deliver remains constrained due to numerous factors. Around $935 billion, or 25% of the US healthcare expenditure, is wasted due to administrative red tape or inefficiencies, pricing irregularity, and labour shortages. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a shortage of 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals by 2035. Experts think an active adoption of technology and virtual delivery systems can help overcome such a significant shortage of healthcare professionals in the near future.15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe initially compiled an extensive list of companies actively involved in the healthcare sector.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was upgraded from a Market Perform to an Outperform rating, and the target price was revised from $90 to $100 by Evan Seigerman at BMO Capital. The analyst highlighted that the Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company has the “best-in-class” cell therapy portfolio that is backed by a stellar manufacturing ability. Furthermore, the company is also focused on improving its solid tumour oncology division by bringing Trodelvy into its portfolio by getting the drug’s commercialization rights in the Asian market from Everest Medicines.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”13. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a Nashville, Tennessee-based healthcare services company founded in 1968. The company operates a vast network of hospitals, outpatient centres, and other healthcare facilities across the US and UK. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is expanding its presence in Texas as it announced the acquisition of 41 urgent care centres from FastMed earlier this month. Presently, the company has 92 urgent care centres along with 45 hospitals and 395 physician practices present in the Lone Star State. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) has made an investment outlay of $6.6 billion in the last six years in the state. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 0.86% as of May 29.Renaissance Investment Management shared its stance on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Lastly, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) was another contributor. The company is seeing solid improvements in surgical volumes and overall healthcare usage. Meanwhile, labor expenses, which have weighed heavily on operating margins, appear to be reversing as extra headcount brought on to accommodate spikes in patient volumes due to COVID is finally subsiding.”12. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a San Diego, California-based medical device company founded in 1999 that specializes in the development and manufacturing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Matthew Blackman at Stifel increased the price target on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) from $130 to $140 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock in an investment note issued on April 28. The analyst shared that the company’s Q1 2023 results checked “all the important boxes,” in his opinion.Baron Funds shared its outlook on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”11. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67On May 18, Richard Newitter at Truist raised the price target on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) from $325 to $347 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. In April 2023, the stock price of the Sunnyvale, California-based robotic surgical system producer recorded the highest increase in three years following the release of the company’s Q1 2023 results. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) saw its revenue increase by 13.4% YoY to $1.69 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast of $1.68 billion. Meanwhile, the adjusted EPS was posted at $1.23 and was three cents higher than analysts' forecast.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.”10. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) secured tenth position on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy now. On May 11, an analyst at Argus raised the price target on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) from $320 to $350 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst noted that the acceptance of a supplemental biologics license application by the FDA for Leqembi for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s could be a growth catalyst for Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock. Furthermore, the review of Lecanemab in China, Europe, and Japan and, subsequently, its approval in these markets could provide further impetus to the growth outlook of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB).9. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based provider of health insurance products and services to individuals, employers, and government-sponsored programs.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is likely to be approved for obesity in 2023. Lilly has two new obesity drugs advancing into Phase 3 trials. Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations, and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”6. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73On May 18, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) received encouraging news as an independent panel of experts at the US FDA recommended the approval of Abrysvo, a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE).

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $200 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure critical long lead material and associated efforts to support maintenance of the full rate production timeline for the congressionally added F/A-18E/F aircraft.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in El Segundo, CA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

""You can say we're disappointed because it means a delay, but the team is proud that we're making the right choices.""The delay for the crewed flight test is the latest hitch in Boeing's Starliner program, which has suffered numerous setbacks and engineering hurdles since it first attempted to dock to the ISS during a 2019 test flight that was cut short over software failures.Boeing discovered last week that a type of tape used across the spacecraft to bundle its sprawling system of wires was flammable, Nappi said, with it now mulling a plan to wrap the flammable tape with new material in the most vulnerable areas to reduce any fire hazard.Boeing has reported $883 million in total losses on its Starliner program, regulatory filings show. Its fixed-price NASA contract for the spacecraft's testing, development and six astronaut missions has swelled by roughly $300 million to $4.5 billion, according to contract data.Nappi said it was too early to tell if the two new issues would add to Boeing's losses and suggested that the company, not NASA, would bear the cost of the required fixes.

(AP) — Boeing’s astronaut capsule faces more launch delays after the discovery of problems that should have been caught earlier, officials said.Boeing and NASA announced the latest setback Thursday.Until recently, the Starliner capsule was on track for a July test flight with two astronauts to the International Space Station, a planned trip that was already well behind schedule.But final reviews uncovered issues with the parachute lines and other problems that were present on last year's test flight with no one on board and, officials said, should have been caught years ago.As for whether Starliner might fly by year's end, Boeing program manager Mark Nappi said, “I think it’s feasible, but I certainly don’t want to commit to any dates or time frames"" until the problems are fixed.The capsule is full of wire harnesses wrapped in white tape that's flammable, according to Nappi. Rather than trying to remove the hundreds of feet of tape, which was supposed to protect against scuffing, the company may cover it with a safer material.The parachute lines also were not designed to be strong enough to meet safety standards.“These tests were run many years ago. We reviewed those results. We missed those results, and this could have been caught sooner,” Nappi said.Following the retirement of the space shuttles more than a decade ago, NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to transport astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX has now completed 10 crew flights, three of them private. Boeing had to repeat its 2019 test flight without a crew because of software and other issues.“NASA desperately needs a second provider for crew transportation,” said Steve Stich, the space agency's commercial crew program manager.The goal is to have one SpaceX and one Boeing taxi flight to the station each year.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The results are published in two papers in the June 2 issue of Science (issue 6648), detailing the training of the algorithm and its application to half a million genomes in the UK Biobank cohort. Two accompanying papers on the primate evolution research that informed the development of PrimateAI-3D also published in the journal today.Illumina today announced the new PrimateAI-3D, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm trained on genomic sequencing data from 233 species of nonhuman primates. Because of their closeness to the human genome, nonhuman primate species are uniquely valuable in teaching us about the genetic basis of human diseases. PrimateAI-3D is shown to predict with unprecedented accuracy disease-causing genetic mutations in patients. The results are published in two papers in the June 2 issue""It is exciting to see PrimateAI-3D and the latest in AI technology combine with the most advanced DNA sequencing capabilities,"" said Francis deSouza, chief executive officer of Illumina. ""Helping clinicians and researchers keep up with the vast quantities of genomic data now being generated from our platforms holds the potential to exponentially accelerate the critical work underway to better serve patients.""According to the National Institutes of Health, the amount of genomic data being generated is approaching 40 billion gigabytes each year. The ability to share, analyze, and interpret genomic data is critical to unlocking discoveries that will advance understanding of human health and improve precision medicine.An AI algorithm trained by natural selectionEach person carries millions of genetic variants that underlie individual differences in health and disease risk, but most of these variants are presently of unknown function. By highlighting disease-causing variants with unparalleled accuracy, PrimateAI-3D addresses a critical challenge facing the successful implementation of personalized genomic medicine.Story continuesTo achieve its state-of-the-art performance, PrimateAI-3D utilizes deep neural network architectures similar to ChatGPT and AlphaFold, but is trained on genome sequences rather than human language. However, unlike generative language models such as ChatGPT, where existing texts can be used to inform training, the genetic variants that cause disease in the human genome are largely unknown.To overcome this, PrimateAI-3D effectively uses natural selection to train the parameters of the deep neural network, using millions of benign genetic variants identified through the sequencing of 233 diverse primate species, the largest such sequencing effort of nonhuman primate species to date. Sequencing nonhuman primates can help scientists infer the pathogenicity of human genetic variants, and thus improve clinical variant interpretation on a genome-wide scale.The result is a deep neural network that has been shown to identify disease-causing variants with superior accuracy in all six clinical cohorts that were tested, and provide individualized predictions of genetic disease risk that have been validated in a cohort of nearly half a million people.""Because of their closeness to the human genome, nonhuman primate species are uniquely valuable, both for what they can teach us about the genetic basis of human diseases, and in their own right,"" said Kyle Farh, vice president of Artificial Intelligence at Illumina and senior author of the publications.Unlocking precision medicine and genetic-based drug target discoveryAs described in the accompanying paper published in Science, Illumina scientists, along with academic collaborators, next applied the PrimateAI-3D algorithm to identify rare pathogenic mutations in nearly half a million individuals in the UK Biobank. They found that the genomes of 97% of otherwise healthy members of the general population harbor highly actionable variants for at least one of 90 different clinical conditions that they surveyed. PrimateAI-3D also greatly improved the accuracy of genetic risk prediction, enabling the first demonstration of polygenic risk scores that were largely unaffected by ancestry bias, a key step toward the equitable implementation of genetic-based precision medicine for diverse, non-European populations.""The application of the latest advances in AI to genomics opens tremendous opportunities for Illumina in both genetic risk prediction and drug target discovery by decoding the basis of complex genetic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and autoimmune diseases,"" said Alex Aravanis, chief technology officer of Illumina.PrimateAI-3D will be made broadly available to the genomics community PrimateAI-3D will be made broadly available to the genomics community integrated across Illumina Connected Software.Use of forward-looking statementsThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Shares have added about 2.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Repligen due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Repligen Beats on Q1 Earnings, Revises 2023 GuidanceRepligen reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 64 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents and our model estimates of 57 cents. The bottom line, however, declined 30% year over year.Total revenues of $183 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $181 million and our model estimates of $179.9 million. Sales declined 12% year over year and 9% at constant currency (cc) due to predicted decline in COVID-related revenues.Quarter in DetailsThe company reported product revenues of $182.6 million, down 11.5% from that recorded in the year-ago period. It also recorded royalty and other revenues of $0.39 million, almost flat year over year.Repligen’s base business revenues were up 7% year over year on cc basis.The chromatography and proteins businesses were the major growth drivers in the first quarter of 2023. The uptick in these two business franchises offset the decline in COVID-related revenues.The company’s chromatography business performed well with 20% growth in revenues. This improvement can be attributed to an increased demand for OPUS pre-packed columns due to growing resin requirement.Repligen expects its chromatography business to witness a 10% growth rate in 2023.The protein franchise had a good quarter as well, driven by strong demand for NGL ligands that Repligen supplies to Purolite. However, the surge in revenues was partially offset by a decline in demand for Cytiva. The company expects this business’s 2023 revenues to be flat year over year.Story continuesThe filtration franchise’s sales declined 20% year over year due to a decline in COVID-related revenues. The base filtration business was also down almost 5%. The company expects this business to recover in the third quarter of 2023 as the macro headwinds, such as the impact of currency, are likely to subside by then.The process analytics franchise had an excellent quarter. Revenues were up 30% year over year. Repligen anticipates this business to grow 15-20% in 2023.The gene-therapy business recorded 20% growth in revenues.Adjusted gross margin was 55.2%, down 520 basis points (bps) year over year due to increased material cost, currency headwinds and a less favorable product mix.Adjusted research and development expenses came in at $12.1 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter’s level.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $47.7 million, up 5% year over year.Adjusted operating income totaled $40.9 million, down 39% from that recorded in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, down 1020 bps year over year.Updated 2023 GuidanceRepligen lowered its sales and profit guidance for 2023.The company now expects total revenues in the range of $720-$760 million, down from the earlier projected level of $760-$800 million. Thisis due to lower base business revenues.Repligen also anticipates base business revenues to increase 4-8% on a reported and constant currency basis. The range is lower than the previous guidance of 11-15% on a reported basis and 12-16% at cc.Adjusted net income is projected in the band of $134-$138 million, down from the earlier guidance of $149-$154 million. Adjusted operating income is anticipated in the $153-$158 million range, lower than the earlier projected band of $176-$182 million.Repligen projects adjusted gross margin in the 52-53% range, down from the previous guidance of 52.5-53.5%. Adjusted operating margin is expected in the range of 20.5-21.5%, also down from the earlier guidance of 22.5-23.5%.Adjusted EPS is anticipated between $2.35 and $2.42, indicating a decline from the prior estimation of $2.61-$2.69.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -18.18% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Repligen has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Repligen has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerRepligen belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Another stock from the same industry, Illumina (ILMN), has gained 0.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Illumina reported revenues of $1.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.1%. EPS of $0.08 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Illumina is expected to post earnings of $0.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -94.7%.

""She's a phenomenal communicator who is dispelling the myths and misconceptions about nuclear energy through her interactions across the country and even internationally.""Seeking to learn more about core design, she met with reactor engineers at Vogtle 1&amp;2 and visited the spent fuel pool. Later, the Vogtle 3&amp;4 chapter of North American Young Generation in Nuclear (NAYGN) hosted Grace for lunch and a Q&amp;A session, where she talked about what drew her to nuclear (her dad was an engineer who has survived cancer with the aid of nuclear medicine). She answered questions based on her classwork, research on advanced reactors, and internships related to fusion and commercial nuclear power. She also shared stories from her childhood, competition experiences and fun facts such as she's a classical violinist who also learned fiddle tunes like ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia.""""Grace is a rockstar for nuclear!"" said Vogtle 3&amp;4 NAYGN Chair Paul Rodi. ""She was relatable, down to earth, and hilarious! Our NAYGN members are excited to hear more from her as a keynote at our national annual conference next month.""Story continuesGrace was thrilled to be on site as the project announced a new milestone for Unit 4 - the completion of Hot Functional Testing. She went in Unit 4 containment to see the reactor vessel firsthand, visited the Unit 3 Control Room, and was able to run simulations at the Unit 3&amp;4 Training Center - including initiating a manual reactor trip. She noted how exciting it was to experience first-hand the digital modernization at the site.""The energy industry is fortunate to have Grace as an ambassador,"" said Communications Coordinator Mike McCracken, who accompanied her throughout her time in Augusta. ""As a nuclear engineer, she understands the importance of a diverse energy mix and helps her audiences, who typically don't know anything about either nuclear or the energy grid, understand how all of the technologies work together to ensure clean, reliable electricity. It's exciting to watch her tell our story.""Following graduation, Grace wants to have hands-on plant experience while learning energy policy and continuing to positively advocate for the future of the nuclear industry.Southern Company, Thursday, June 1, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Southern Company on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Southern CompanyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/southern-companyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Southern CompanyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758718/Miss-America-Grace-Stanke-Visits-Georgias-Plant-Vogtle-Nuclear-Site]"

So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before getting started, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our team and how they have continued to navigate an extremely dynamic macro environment. On that note, let's discuss the current macro landscape. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we said that we expected pressure to be more intense in 2023 compared to 2022. Subsequently, demand trends began to worsen in mid-March and further decelerated in April.We believe cooler temperatures and headlines surrounding layoffs and the banking crisis were factors, but so were the compounding effect of some previously identified macro headwinds. The U.S. consumer, particularly at Macy's, pulled back more than we anticipated as they reallocated spend to food, essentials and services. We have planned our business for the remainder of the year, assuming mid-March through April macro headwinds continue and potentially worsen, and we have taken decisive actions in the second quarter and the back half of the year to ensure we are well positioned to compete.We will go into more detail on these shortly. But first, let's discuss first quarter results. We achieved adjusted diluted EPS of $0.56 versus our expectations net sales were below, gross margin rate was above and inventories were in line at down 7% year-over-year. February and early March performed largely in line with expectations. As previously mentioned, trends worsened in late March. We entered April confident in our product and had several important events, including Friends and Family of Macy's, the spring break season and Easter. As April progressed, demand worsened across nameplates. The decline was most pronounced at Macy's, which has the largest exposure to the lower and middle income consumer with roughly 50% of its identified customers and an average household income of $75,000 or under and about 85% at $150,000 or under. By nameplate, Macy's net sales declined 7.7% and comparable sales declined 7.9% on an owned plus licensed basis versus a 10.1% increase last year. We began the quarter with limited inventory carryover. Consistent with our inventory discipline, we had sold through the majority of fall and holiday product in the fourth quarter.In hindsight, we converted too early with spring fashion well set by early March, but without enough balance in weather-appropriate apparel and footwear. Store traffic was healthy but conversion was challenged. Most of the country experienced below average temperatures for an extended period of time, while we were over-indexed in spring and early summer fashion, including special occasion and did not have enough colder weather and seasonless product. Ultimately, sell-throughs were below expectations as our customer became increasingly more deliberate in how they are allocating discretionary spend and buying closer to need. On the flip side, categories we are known for that are less discretionary and weather dependent, including beauty, particularly fragrances, women's career sportswear and men's tailored all outperformed. We also began to experience a comeback in certain pandemic categories including textiles, housewares and top of table, which is encouraging.At Macy's Backstage, which curates lower price point merchandise and flows and freshness more often, store within stores outperformed the full-line locations in which they operate by approximately 150 basis points on a comp owned plus licensed sales basis. These locations benefited from a greater emphasis on seasonless product and a strong value proposition. We currently operate a 310 back stages, including 301 store within stores and plan to open 9 more this year. Our luxury nameplates, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury were also impacted by macro pressures, although not at the same rate or intensity as Macy's. Bloomingdale's results were roughly in line with our expectations. Net sales declined 2.3% and comparable sales were down 4.3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus a 26.9% gain last year.Bloomingdale's registered strength in beauty, particularly fragrances, men's and women's contemporary apparel and housewares. Bloomingdale's outlet, a relatively undeveloped part of the nameplate that appeals to the more value-conscious luxury customer also continued to outperform. At Bluemercury, results once again exceeded expectations, benefiting from our differentiated product mix and unique competitive position as a luxury beauty retailer. Net sales rose 4.4% and comparable sales increased 4.3% versus a 25.2% gain last year, benefiting from strength in clinical and medical skin care as well as color.Quarter-to-date, demand trends have accelerated from April across nameplates. As the weather has turned more seasonal, our customer has been responding well to our compelling offerings and price points. We are likely also benefiting from pent-up demand. Although encouraging, we do not have clarity on whether or not these improvements indicate a trend change reflective of a healthier consumer. These improvements have been strongest at Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, potentially indicating a further bifurcation of customer behavior by income tier, which we are closely monitoring. While first quarter adjusted EPS at Macy's, Inc. was ultimately better than our expectations, we did not end as strong as we would have liked. We will not carry problems from one quarter to the next. We have moved quickly to improve the composition of our assortments for the back half. At the same time, we are also taking a more cautious view of our customer. The high end of our second quarter and full year guidance ranges assume heightened macro pressures experienced in mid-March through April that they persist, while the low end of both contemplates potential deterioration as the year progresses. If demand improves, we will use our ample inventory receipt reserve, which is above last year's levels to chase into areas of strength as they materialize. Availability of goods remains robust, and we are confident that with our strong liquidity position, we will be able to secure the right product to support demand curves, if justified. Now let's turn to the specific actions we have taken to ensure we are well positioned to compete in the back half and longer term. For the second quarter, we have accelerated the timing and depth of promotional events, markdowns and clearance at Macy's to liquidate seasonal merchandise. This includes slower moving first quarter spring transitional receipts as well as May flows that we were unable to impact following the rapid deterioration in demand. We are utilizing our pricing science tools to approach markdowns and promotions with precision to maximize merchandise margin. We have also adjusted the timing, composition, amount and value proposition of receipts. For the third and fourth quarters, we are leaning into categories that are working, like beauty, career sportswear and gifting and are further reducing our emphasis on down-trending categories. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter and our leading position as a gifting destination, this year, we will have more newness compared to last year, including exclusives that leverage our strong vendor relationships in beauty, where we had great Mother's Day and Valentine's Day performance and in toys.We also recognized the need for a better balance of cold and warm weather goods at Macy's. Adjustments have been made to flow product closer to need. In addition, we are working with our partners to offer more seasonless year-round fashion content. Other actions taken, improved receipt flow and in-stock position within our core assortment, enhanced pricing algorithms to maximize sales, margin and competitive positioning and updated marketing messaging to speak to our even stronger value proposition.It is imperative that we have the right assortment, including the appropriate mix of private and national brands that our customers care about with compelling value and price points that appeal to our diverse fashion-conscious base. Value does not mean the lowest price. It means offering the right brands, fashion content and elevated omnichannel shopping experiences. This morning, we are excited to share that we are bringing Nike back to the Macy's nameplate this fall. This mutually beneficial relationship reflects our strategy to provide customers with an enhanced and elevated offering. Starting in October, an expanded Nike selection, including apparel, plus size women's, big and tall men's, kids, bags and gear will be available online and in key locations nationwide. Footwear will continue to be sold in our Finish Line licensed locations. We look forward to scaling our Nike partnership with additional locations in spring of 2024. We remain focused on the long term. Balance sheet health and cash preservation are critical to achieving our goals. About 6 months ago, we embarked on a cost-savings project to reimagine our ways of working, drive clear prioritization across key enterprise capabilities and reduce complexity. Given late first quarter trends, that work was accelerated, and we have identified an additional $200 million of cost savings for this year and roughly $300 million to $350 million of savings in 2024. We have also reduced this year's planned CapEx spend by roughly $50 million. Adrian will discuss the specifics, but investments in our five growth vectors remain protected. Our ambitions are greater than our recent results. As a seasoned retailer, we understand the challenges that we are facing, and we'll continue to pull the levers needed to achieve our aspiration of low single-digit sales growth and a sustainable low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin beginning in 2024.The biggest risk to achieving that goal is that pressures on the consumer further intensify at an accelerated rate next year. I am confident that we have the right strategy and team to lead us into the future. I have a tremendous amount of personal and professional respect for incoming CEO, Tony Spring. He is an excellent merchant and marketer and has a well-deserved reputation as an innovator, brand builder and talent developer. And this marks Adrian's first call as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, a promotion that is well deserved. Adrian's strategic thinking and financial acumen have enabled us to achieve our current position of financial strength and has set us up to continue to make crucial investments for future success. Congratulations to you both. I look forward to what you will achieve together. And I know you're all excited to hear from Tony, so I'm going to turn it over to him for some brief comments.Antony SpringThank you for the introduction, Jeff, and for your leadership and tremendous support. And thank you to our Board of Directors for their confidence and support. I also want to acknowledge the entire leadership team and our colleagues for their ongoing commitment to our brands and business. Please know how humbled and honored I am to have been chosen to take on Macy's Inc.'s CEO role this upcoming February.For those of you I have not met before, let's start with my background and approach to leadership. I consider myself a curious generalist, who brings a high level of self-awareness and ambition to the teams I lead. As many of you know, I began my career at Bloomingdale's roughly 36 years ago. During my tenure, I've split my time somewhat equally between merchandise, marketing, stores and senior leadership. As I look back, I've always viewed the area I was in as the engine that was driving the business. Today, I realize how complementary and intertwined they all are. As a merchant, our products must be curated and compelling. As a marketer, our strategy must be engaging, inspiring and personalized.Of course, our digital experience is closely linked as the window to our brands and a large source of commerce. As a stores leader, we must rally our colleagues around an enjoyable and differentiated experience centered on the customer. Finally, as a senior leader, we must ensure that our recipe includes the right balance of all of these elements. Over the last decade, I've had the distinct privilege of leading Bloomingdale's. I want to take a moment to acknowledge my team there.During my tenure, we achieved record sales and customer and colleague engagement. Coming off our 150th anniversary, Bloomingdale's offers a curated merchandise assortment and has a loyal following. Our loyalty program is best-in-class, and our marketing is distinctive with events, activations and pop-ups animating many campaigns, which underscores my personal belief in retailers there. I view Macy's Inc. as an incredible and unparalleled portfolio of nameplates and brands, representing off-price to luxury, on-mall to off-mall, private to national brands, our multichannel, multigenerational and multi-category platform gives us opportunity to satisfy the customers' appetite for all of our categories.It's important to acknowledge the tremendous progress we've made as we've modernized our business, which sets us up for future success, but it's also important to recognize that across nameplates, we have room to improve. That is what makes our potential so exciting to be a part of. My experience at Bloomingdale's bring an outsider insider perspective to the Macy's brand, which is beneficial during this heightened period of uncertainty.Over the next several months, I intend to continue to listen and learn and lead my new areas of responsibility, which include merchandise, marketing and digital strategy. I will do so with clear eyes and a focus on what's possible long term while maintaining a disciplined approach to near-term controllables. I look forward to sharing my thoughts and observations as the year progresses. One thing I know for certain is that this is a renowned business and one which I'm incredibly passionate about. Recent results and our revised outlook have not changed my view. However, we were out of balance in the first quarter, overemphasizing spring seasonal merchandise rather than cold weather and seasonless merchandise. We are containing the related markdown to the second quarter and have adjusted the timing amount and composition of buys for the fall and holiday.Turning to the long term. I now want to take a moment to provide my thoughts on each of our five growth vectors, which are designed to focus our resources and our teams on the leverage that will bring top line growth back to Macy's, Inc. in 2024 and beyond. While still early, we believe that each will be a meaningful contributor to the future. First, let's start with Macy's private brands. I firmly believe that our success is tied to the right combination of compelling private brands, popular national brands and the curation of unique brands appropriate for our target customers, all of the compelling value equation. That has been one of our formulas of success at both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. In my new role, I have had the pleasure of working even more closely with the Macy's private brand team on their strategy.During the first quarter, INC Women's and Club Room Men's both of which have been reimagined, outperformed their respective broader apparel segments at Macy's. Looking ahead, we are excited about the launch of our newest brand, which will offer women's apparel and accessories later this summer. Stay tuned. Our second growth vector is small format stores. These allow us to optimize our total store portfolio at both Macy's and Bloomingdales' through replacement, densification and new market opportunities. They balance our traditional large-format on-mall locations with a more localized off-mall experience that's physically closer to our existing and target customers, encouraging a higher frequency of trips.We're continuing to enhance these stores and are learning every day how we can better serve our customers. Results are very encouraging. During the first quarter, our small format stores opened at least one fiscal year achieved positive comparable owned plus licensed sales group. Customer experience scores, particularly regarding the physical environment, ease of checkout and colleagues being helpful and available are high. Interestingly, we are experiencing limited-to-no cannibalization in existing markets where we open off-mall formats. Instead, customers are making additional shopping trips. Long term, we remain bullish about the small format store opportunity as off-mall retail continues to be a dominant in-person shopping method for U.S. consumers, and we're evaluating potential locations to enable accelerated growth. We look forward to sharing more as this work develops further. Now on to our third growth vector, Macy's marketplace. We are seeing new customers and a younger existing customer respond to our new and expanding categories, which has resulted in increased basket size.During the first quarter, we added approximately 450 brands ending the quarter roughly 950 brands. We're seeing indicators of a strong growth rate with marketplace's gross merchandise value increasing over 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and average order value and units per order approximately 50% above those customers not [shopping] at marketplace. Needless to say, we are very excited to launch a Bloomingdale's marketplace earlier in the fall. Our fourth growth vector is luxury. With fiscal 2022 representing record sales at both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, we're excited to continue to invest in both nameplates. The teams are attracting sought-after brands, leveraging their distinctive marketing and satisfying their core customer.Based on the power of our relationships with our vendors and customers, I see opportunity for store, digital and marketplace growth in both nameplates. At Macy's, we've made a commitment to elevate our beauty business with a larger luxury assortment. We first began to offer more luxury beauty at Macy's in 2018 and has since added many brands, including Carolina Herrera Beauty, which is exclusive; Armani; Saint Laurent; Tom Ford; Gucci, Maison Margiela; and La Mer, just a name a few. This is an area that even in the current environment, we're seeing very limited price resistance and even more partnerships on the horizon. Last but certainly not least, our fifth growth vector, personalized offers and communications. The power to talk to over 40 million consumers with the right offer at the right time really resonates with me. I believe it will be a true unlock for both our promotional offerings and merchandise messaging. During the first quarter, we leaned into personalization of a customer's offer within our typical event structure. These tests, which were based on predictive behavioral models allow us to show different customers' various value propositions by level of discount and category of offer.This is in addition to loyalty life cycle offers such as [data's] earn-back accelerators and targeted offers to at-risk customers. Testing suggest that personalized offers can foster sales growth, margin expansion and stronger customer engagement. We have accelerated our analytics-powered campaigns in the second quarter, and we'll use learnings to inform our view of opportunities at both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury.Now before I turn it over to Adrian, let me say how excited I am to be working even more closely with him and to have his counsel, leadership and partnership. What makes this transition so seamless and the succession so thoughtful is the complementary skills that Adrian and I bring to this company. He has had a noticeable impact on the organization since he joined almost 3 years ago. Our balance sheet health, including no material debt maturities until 2027 and fixed interest rate debt give us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our long-term opportunities and return capital to shareholders despite the uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment.  With Jeff's support, we will return Macy's Inc. to profitable growth. I look forward to getting to know all of you and sharing our progress. Now I'll turn it over to Adrian.Adrian V. MitchellThanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking Jeff and the Board for their ongoing belief and trust in me. From bringing me on three years ago as Chief Financial Officer to recently expanding my responsibilities to include stores, supply chain and technology. With my new responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer, I have the opportunity to go deeper into the design and execution of our long-term goals. As we aim to maximize opportunity and value, I am hyper-focused on building a faster, more flexible and more efficient operating model that drives sustainable sales and margin growth by creating alignment on those priorities that will have a meaningful longer-term impact on this business.  That's a multiyear effort. And as I think about how to tackle it, I have started with several fundamental questions. What can we do to better serve our customers and improve the end-to-end omnichannel shopping experience? How do we optimize our physical store footprint with the small-format stores to accelerate growth while enhancing our inventory flow, merchandise planning and localized assortment capabilities and evaluating our updated growth aspirations, how do we further modernize our supply chain and technology infrastructure to support the omnichannel shopping experience we aspire to deliver in the future. Reflecting on the last two months, I've been on a listening tour, spending a lot more time in stores, DCs and with the technology team identifying areas of opportunity. As I have been ramping up on these businesses, I've been highly encouraged to see stability in hiring, retention and turnover and have been impressed with the talent across these teams. I've also spent a significant amount of time with Tony. His experience in merchandising, marketing and stores serves as a nice balance to my years in large-scale transformation and consulting and my background in retail operations, including data and analytics, technology, strategy, stores and supply chain.He is a seasoned operator that understands department stores and fashion inside and out while I'm the transformational specialists focused on modernizing our retail operations. We are fully aligned of what is needed to propel Macy's Inc. into the future. We will maintain a disciplined approach to our inventories and markdown liability, offer differentiated products and value to our customers and we'll not chase unprofitable sales. For us, that's now table stakes. Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen the foundation of our core businesses while simultaneously investing in our five growth vectors. Despite recent headwinds, Tony and I remain committed to our aspiration of achieving low single-digit sales growth and a sustainable low double-digit EBITDA margin starting in 2024.Now let's walk through the first quarter results of our five value-creation levers before I provide an update on our 2023 outlook. First, omnichannel sales. We generated net sales of $5 billion, a decline of 6.8% versus the prior year. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 7.2%. Macy's, Inc owned AUR rose 4.7%, driven by ticket increases and category mix. For the year, we continue to expect an improvement in AUR year-over-year through a combination of ticket increases, lower markdowns and category mix.  Next, other revenue. As a reminder, beginning this quarter, we are reclassing credit card revenues and Macy's Media Network revenue to other revenue. Credit card revenues were previously reported as their own cash in, while Macy's Media Network revenue was reported within SG&amp;A. During the quarter, other revenues were 3.8% of net sales. Credit card revenues were $162 million, down $29 million from last year. As a percent of net sales, credit card revenues were 3.3% or 30 basis points lower than last year, primarily reflecting the impact of higher bad debt within the portfolio. Macy's Media Network revenue was $29 million versus $26 million in the prior year. Moving to the second value creation lever, gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 40%, 40 basis points above prior year. Merchandise margin was flat, benefiting from lean beginning of the year inventory levels and lower clearance markdowns, offset by promotion and category mix shifts. As it relates to delivery expense, continued cost mitigation efforts contributed to a 40 basis point improvement versus last year, primarily on better contracted rates, reductions in packages per order and a 1-point decline in digital penetration.The third value creation lever is inventory productivity. Inventory declined 7% year-over-year, in line with our net sales decline. Trailing 12-month inventory turnover was down 2% to last year, reflecting the decline in sales versus the comparable period. Adjustments to the timing, amount and composition of receipts beginning in the second quarter are expected to drive back half sell-throughs and strengthen inventory productivity. Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&amp;A increased $45 million or 2.4% to $1.95 billion. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue was 37.7%, 350 basis points higher than last year. As a reminder, the increase in minimum wage for stores colleagues was fully implemented on May 1 last year. The higher year-over-year SG&amp;A dollars and rate reflects the lapping of these increases and includes continued investments in colleagues across competitive pay incentives and benefits.SG&amp;A also includes the increase in depreciation and amortization expense. After accounting for interest and taxes, first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.56 versus $1.08 in 2022. Lastly, the fifth value creation lever capital allocation. Our top focus is liquidity. We continue to take a thoughtful approach to capital allocation, prioritizing a healthy balance sheet, investments in our business and our five growth vectors and returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we generated $105 million of operating cash flow compared to $248 million last year, primarily due to lower earnings in the current year quarter versus last year. We invested $296 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow inclusive of proceeds from real estate was an outflow of $166 million. As part of our open-ended share repurchase authorization, we bought back approximately 1.4 million shares for $25 million. We also paid $45 million of dividends. Now on to our outlook.Let's start with a discussion of our cost savings efforts. As Jeff mentioned, we have identified an incremental $200 million of cost savings for this year versus our prior outlook. For 2024, we estimate the savings to be between $300 million and $350 million, impacting both gross margin and SG&amp;A. Roughly 30% of the savings in 2023 will be in gross margin, and the remainder will be in SG&amp;A. A small portion has been recognized in the first quarter. Savings build as the year progresses and will be most significant in the fourth quarter.Now let's discuss our full year and second quarter outlook, both of which contemplate ongoing pressure on our customer. The low end assumes macro pressures worsen while the high end assumes they remain stable with levels experienced in mid-March through April. With so many mixed signals, it is prudent to take a cautious stance. We will continue to embrace the financial and operational disciplines that we have implemented over the past several years. If demand improves, we will lean into our reserves and chase intra-quarter. But we are going to wait for proof points to do that, and our improved May trends are not enough.Alternatively, if demand trends worsen, we have the flexibility to make further adjustments. We can and will do better. We have been course correcting and have made adjustments to the second, third and fourth quarters. Looking at the full year, our expectations for Macy's, Inc. are now as follows: net sales of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion. Comparable sales on a 52-week owned-plus license basis to be down about 7.5% to 6% year-over-year. As a reminder, compares ease in the third and fourth quarters. Other revenue to be about 3.6% of net sales with credit card revenues accounting for 82% to 83% of that. The reduction in our credit card revenue outlook is primarily a result of our reduced annual sales expectations. A gross margin rate of 38% to 38.5% on our expectation for deeper markdowns in the second quarter to drive sell-throughs and ensure we enter the third quarter in a clean inventory position. The second quarter should be viewed as an exception, not a change in course.Our philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to be focused on protecting gross margin. We will navigate the year with the intent to stimulate increased conversion and margin dollar expansion. Our annual gross margin rate outlook also includes an estimate for increased shrink, which we call shortage relative to our initial expectations. Starting in Q2, we have further enhanced our pricing science capabilities to automate strategic promotions from vendor direct to owned inventory. This gives us the opportunity to bring an automated pricing solution that incorporates category elasticities, maximizes inventory turnover and optimizes unit sales left and margin dollar expansion to our owned inventory portfolio.In addition, we also continued to refine our competitive intelligence, which provides us a better understanding of the competitive landscape and enhances our decisions around location-level pricing. SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue is expected to be about 35.4% to 35.5%, reflecting the reduction in our sales expectations, along with the cost savings work discussed earlier.And adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.8% to 9.4% or 9.1% to 9.7% as a percent of net sales. After interest and taxes, we are estimating annual adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70 to $3.20. This takes into account a roughly $0.12 negative impact from increased shortage relative to our previous expectations. Our adjusted EPS guidance does not assume the impact of potential share repurchases but does consider the proactive actions taken for the back half.For the second quarter, we expect net sales of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. Gross margin rate to be down no more than 100 basis points for the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter includes clearance markdowns to address remaining first quarter seasonal inventory and May receipts that we were unable to adjust in time to align with our updated sales expectations. We expect this to be the only quarterly deterioration to prior year.Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15. End-of-quarter inventories to be down low to mid-single digits to last year on a percentage basis. While we cannot control the macro environment and how our consumers respond, we remain focused on offering our customer the best product, experience and value. There is no finish line for this work. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress across the organization. We have reduced our reliance on markdown allowances, shifted to an upfront cost negotiation model with vendors, incentivized merchants at the Macy's Inc. level rather than by their respective category performance and build data and analytics into our processes. Looking ahead, the Macy's nameplate is shifting to cost accounting in 2024, which should help incorporate further disciplines. These actions together speak to how we are running our business from a much healthier and more educated place than in the past. So while we recognize the macroeconomic climate has created a larger headwind on our business than originally anticipated when we first introduced our annual outlook in early March, we are responding and remaining agile to ensure we meet the needs of our customers. The disciplines we have built into our decision-making and culture gives us the foundation to balance the current environment while executing with clarity on our long-term growth goals. We remain committed to our aspiration of achieving low single-digit sales growth and a sustainable low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin beginning in fiscal 2024, even with the assumption that macro pressures persist. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.Jeffrey GennetteThanks, Adrian. We are a modern department store with a rich history that has weathered these storms before, and we will do so again. Our financial health, operational efficiencies and data-driven process and tools are unique advantages that allow us to navigate through uncertain periods as we continue to invest in the future. We are a competitive team here at Macy's. We are not standing still. We are committed to better serving our customers and improving our business. Our teams are fully aligned, and we remain focused on protecting and preserving the second half of 2023 in our future growth opportunities, including achieving our sales and EBITDA goals. And with that, operator, we will open it up for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo first, Tony, congrats on the promotion. Maybe high level, where do you see the largest low-hanging fruit for acceleration opportunity as you take the helm? Jeff, could you elaborate on the cadence of top line trends? And in particular, where have you seen this most recent acceleration, whether by category or across income cohorts? And then finally, for Adrian, with this dynamic backdrop, what's your comfort with inventory on hand and just your confidence in clearing any excess by the end of this quarter?Jeffrey GennetteSo Matt, let me go first, and then we'll turn it over to Tony and Adrian. On the cadence of the top line, what you saw was that when you looked at our demand and what was happening in the -- February hit our expectations. As did early March. It started to deteriorate in the latter part of March, and then it decelerated even further in the month of April. So what we saw there was when you look at the seasonal categories, so we basically had -- we thought the appropriate level of carryover in fall and holiday, we had some fresh transitional receipts there. We sold through that pretty aggressively in the first half of the quarter and did not have enough content in those categories as we look at the back half. We had well transitioned into spring and seasonal, and we did not have the sell-throughs that we expected at regular price and when we started to mark it down. So that's the piece that when we're starting to see those inventory levels come up, which is where we kind of bucketed where we're going to be in the second quarter to deal with that to have the appropriate units going into the third quarter.So that would be on kind of the cadence of the top line. When you look at the recent trends in the month of May, you definitely saw a bounce back across nameplates, but most pronounced when you look at Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. So that's the comment that we're making. We're attributing that to two things. One is that it's a pent-up demand for warm weather categories, which is definitely where we saw the acceleration of sell-throughs or is it an improvement in the macro environment? We don't know that answer yet. So when you look at our guide for both the second quarter and the balance of the year, just to reiterate where we're at, we looked at the trend from the end of March through April and extended that by brand, by category, all the way through the rest of the year.We obviously have lots of penetration differences between quarters. Certain businesses become much more important as you get to the back half of the year. We did this very scientifically. We looked at the 1-year CAGR. We looked at a 2-year CAGR. We even went back and looked at 2019. So that's how we approached when we looked at how we were looking at the top end. And then the lower end of the guide was really if the macro conditions step in and they get worse. So that is what's implied in our guide know that when you look at our overall strategy, our objective is to make sure that we are responding in the moment to how customers are transacting.What I would tell you about the customer right now, particularly on the Macy's side, is they're buying much closer to need. So our opportunity to have the receipt reserves that we have to be able to respond in time with all the abundance of inventory to send to market is prudent. So I'll turn it over to Tony to answer your first part of your question.Antony SpringThanks, Matt. I would say, first off, I'm obviously excited about the opportunity and excited about the team that I see at Macy's as being really dedicated, passionate and certainly committed to the overall business results despite the challenging business climate. Macy's is a beloved brand with a multigenerational customer base. The scale of the business really should be an asset. I do see, however, opportunities to simplify our operation, make the experience easier for our colleagues to execute and more enjoyable for our customer.I believe the Macy's Inc. portfolio should be one that we can leverage more fully from both off-price to luxury. I think we've done a good job of leaning into the opportunity on data science or the STEM part of our business. I think if you think of Steam, the art part of our business, we have more work to do on curation, imagination, storytelling and inspiration.Adrian V. MitchellTerrific. Just to speak and close out on the topic of inventory. The simple answer is that we're confident in clearing through the inventory coming out of the second quarter. And as you know, we have the track record around inventory management. Our track record is clear, and we're getting better and better every quarter. Just to put in perspective, we ended last year down 3% in inventory. We ended the first quarter down 7% in inventory. We expect to end the second quarter down low to mid-single digits on inventory, so we are confident given our capabilities and our tools.Now just to put in context, the way we think about inventories in terms of the volume, the mix and having fresh content. And the reality is what we experienced in the first quarter is that we transitioned early. That was a clear bet for us because we were able to have limited carryover coming out of the fourth quarter and coming out of holiday. So we entered in a very solid position, but the weather cooled. But when you look at our content, beauty healthy numbers; career sportswear, healthy numbers; men's tailored, healthy numbers; warm weather, spring seasonal for most of the quarter, soft numbers. So we're putting in our tools and our actions in place, which we have a clear track record on. And we are confident that we'll be able to work through the inventory and get back to a balanced perspective on inventory entering the fall season.OperatorThe next question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver ChenJeff, Tony and Adrian, I was curious about merchandise margins and promotions for the back half and what's implied in guidance. As you do take the markdowns in Q2, what's the duration of those? And how do you do those most efficiently? Would also love your take on just things you're monitoring with the consumer of that behavior. And I assume that the comp volatility is likely in transaction counts. I would love your thoughts on that. And lastly, Tony, what do you think about the younger customer and the opportunity there more broadly? How are you dissecting strategies with respect to that?Jeffrey GennetteOliver, let me take two of your questions. So the merchandise margins, when you look at that, as we indicated, we think that we're going to be above last year's levels for obviously saw that in the first quarter. We're anticipating that in both the third and the fourth and the second, we thought it was going to be within 100 basis points of last year. Now the full year will be higher than the previous year.What you see and can expect from us is that when you look at the spring overhang that we have right now and are anticipating that we will take the appropriate price markdowns there. And what we've been doing through the first part before we marked it down as we were doing higher POS on those. So that has a cycle that we're playing through. We've got -- we have a number of categories in which we're getting higher AURs and higher margins than we did last year. We're expecting that to continue.And then there's other categories in which we're getting sharper on our price points as we know that the customer is looking for promotional value right now. You can see what we're seeing in our price arms in both outlet as well as Backstage. But what we're doing with specials and what we're doing with flash sales. Those are all going to be comparable to where we were last year, and we're looking at the content right now of where that is going to be. So we have a lot of confidence when we look at the back half with respect to where we're going to be with pricing promotion. Probably more important when we look at the back half is where we're going to be with the newness and where we're going to be with all of our gifting categories and how we've rebuilt that based on all the learnings that we had from fourth quarter of last year. So that is how merchandise margin. So expect merchandise margins to continue to be stable and the promotional as I've described. So Tony.Antony SpringOliver, thanks for the question. Let me say first, we will continue to attract a multi-generational customer. I think it's an advantage of being a department store that we have five generations shopping with us. But in terms of your question and how we target and grow the younger customer base, I start with, I'm proud of the fact that the Bloomingdale team has generated more business with the younger customer than we did years ago.It starts with first having the brands consumers are looking for, so challenging our merchant team to be in the market and inquiring through marketplace or through our own distribution channels, those brands. Second is obviously a strong digital strategy. We know the younger customer starts first online. And then thirdly, making sure that we have a powerful presence in the social space. I think we've made some progress, we still have more work to do. I would also add that remember, all of our brands are great at being a part of life moments. And so whether that is sweet 16s, birthdays, anniversaries, wedding, first house first job, all those connote a younger customer. And I think we have an opportunity to own a greater share of that business.Adrian V. MitchellLet me amplify a point that Jeff made on margin, and then I'll speak to the consumer. With regards to the merch margin, I just want to be very clear that the deterioration of no more than 100 basis points is isolated to the second quarter. When you look at our annual outlook for the year on gross margin, it is going to be higher than last year. And as we think about the back half of last year, we have the opportunity to actually beat just given the softness on margin that we experienced in the third and fourth quarters.With regards to the consumer for the year, we're being cautious about the consumer. Now in the month of May, we have seen slightly better trends than what we saw coming out of April. But it's too early to tell from our perspective. So we're actually taking a cautious approach to the high end of our guide, which reflects the March and April trends, the low end of our guide assumes worsening of consumer trends. As we think about May and that favorability on the trends there, is it warm weather? Is it more compelling values? Is it pent-up demand? Is it a new trend? For us, it's too early to tell, so we're taking a cautious stance.OperatorThe next question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachJeff, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more context on the customer engagement trends that you're seeing between your higher-income demographic cohorts and your lower-income demographic cohorts as you ended the quarter and moved into May. Are you seeing evidence of trade down or further pressure on traffic or ticket among any specific sub demographic? And then for Adrian, can you provide a little bit more context on the additional cost savings that you identified. Where are these cost savings being sourced from? How much do you expect to drop to the bottom line? And are there further opportunities to continue to optimize your cost structure?Jeffrey GennetteSo Brooke, let me start with your question on customer behavior. As we've reported in past quarters, we're not seeing a trade down not yet. What we have seen is that all customer types, I'll speak to the Macy's brand, has been basically down about the exact same percentage. What we're seeing is that in some cases, with customers that are responding to either Backstage or they're responding to Market by Macy's, it's entailing another trip, and we're seeing more spend out of them.When you look at the dynamics of our transactions, what you see across all of our customers is basically an increase in AUR about the exact same basket size is what they had in their visits last year. So what they're doing is they're buying less units. They're buying with the higher AUR, so the basket size is about the same. They're coming with the expectation of spending x and that's what they're going out with. But we're not seeing where you're seeing that -- but when you look at the income types that you're seeing, one showing up in Backstage that didn't before. The ones that are showing up in Backstage are in the main house, and we're getting more spend out of them in aggregate. So what we saw in the month of May, though was a separation of the trend, the improvement in the trend at both Bluemercury as well as Bloomingdale's. So there is something that's on our radar screen to see does that more affluent customer. Are they -- is it showing up right now that they're healthier than the Macy's customer, Roach, obviously, watching that one very carefully.Adrian V. MitchellBrooke, great to be with you as well. With regards to cost savings, let me give a little bit of context. We started this work about 6 months ago. And so what we've been doing, given the trends that we saw in the first quarter and year-to-date is really accelerate those activities. The source of the savings comes from two places. The first is gross margin, which represents about 30%. The second is around SG&amp;A.Within gross margin, we really focus on our inbound freight, our carrier network, our delivery expense, and we've been able to contract lower rates. So this is something that should actually trickle into future years for us. The remaining balance is really around SG&amp;A, and it's about reducing the complexity within the business, repositioning the organization for growth and identifying operating expenses on the non-payroll SG&amp;A side that we can actually take out of the system.This year, we've identified an incremental $200 million of opportunity. Next year, the annualized run rate is $300 million to $350 million. In addition to responding to the environment, we've actually reduced our CapEx forecast laminate at that dimension from $1 billion to about $950 million. But to be clear, the growth vectors are protected. We're investing appropriately in the team and the initiatives to get back to growth in 2024. So we've been very surgical, very disciplined in where we're making adjustments and it's just going to be good for the business longer term.OperatorThe next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyWelcome, Tony, can you please expand on the AUR improvement you're expecting to see in the back half of the year, which categories. And also, can you expand a little bit on the store strategy, both for Bloomingdale's and for Macy's in the small store component? And lastly, welcome, Tony, what do you see as bringing over from Bloomingdale's to Macy's.Jeffrey GennetteDana, so let me take the one on AUR. And what you saw from our first quarter post was about a almost 5% -- a 4.7% increase. We do expect that we're going to have a higher AUR in the back half. A lot of that is category mix. So when you look at some of the higher AUR categories are trending for us, and that is driving up that what you see there. There's other categories in which our AUR is below last year based on where we see the environment, how we're looking at price matching, when you look at our competitive cycle, ensuring that we've got the best value for our customers as they're searching in that particular time.So we do expect an improvement in AUR year-over-year. I think that outlook reflects our expectation for all of the heightened markdowns that we're talking about in the second quarter and the planned markdowns that we have for what we're doing in the back half both POS as well as clearance. What I'd bring up is just that our inventory is in really good shape.So while we are heightened right now in spring merchandise, we are chasing opportunities in other categories, we are very committed to that. We have inventory reserve across all of our categories, even the ones that are down trending because freshness is the name of the game in our business, and we always have available content that's out there in the market to purchase. So any demand signal that our merchants have, just remember that our merchants are all rewarded based on the collective Macy’'s brand and how it's doing. So there's huge opportunities for us to ensure that the right customers are being addressed with the right content at the right time.So there is going to be AUR improvement and -- but through all of that, but at the end of the day, we're making sure that our receipts are consistent with where our customers are going.Antony SpringDana, nice to connect again. I appreciate the question. No one is a bigger fan of the Bloomingdale's brand in business than I am. But I would reframe your question is how do we develop a stronger portfolio. Where we can learn from each other without becoming one another. Bloomingdale's strength is certainly curation, bringing variety versus redundancy to the expanded assortments that we offer.Bloomingdale's has a great, strong, best customer base, representing a large portion of their business, but how do we create stronger best customer programs for each of our brands. While Bloomingdale's gets credit for retail-is-theater, The Parade, The Fireworks, the Flower Show are all a part of Macy's heritage. Each brand needs to develop compelling programs to motivate their customer base to engage more frequently, both in-store and online. So I'm looking forward to what we can do going forward.Adrian V. MitchellDana, good to be with you as well. With regards to our store strategy that focuses on growth and our small format stores is actually part of that. As we think about the store strategy, we feel good about the box size we're looking at, the format we're looking at the locations and the power centers that we've been having conversations with.But the thing that we're very excited about is what Tony spoke to earlier in the conversation, which is on a comp basis on small stores, what we're seeing is no cannibalization against the big box as well as comp positive growth in those stores that are not able to comp. So we're on to something quite special here, and we'll share more information as things progress.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citi.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious how your e-com business performed over the quarter versus stores, if you saw a similar fall off on e-com or was it more isolated to the store level? And then I'm curious if you could just talk about how you came into the year thinking about how you would manage inventory in the second half versus how you're planning inventories currently?Jeffrey GennettePaul dot-com and stores were very similar in terms of what happened to their performance in the first quarter. We came into the year expecting that, that was going to be the case that, however, we were modeling dot-com and stores. So just remember where we were in terms of penetration in dot-com. This is basically the resettling of that as customers are coming more back to the stores channel. Obviously, very influenced by what they see digitally, either they transact there or they do research there. But in 2019, we were at a 25% penetration of digital. And in '22, we were 33% after a high in the pandemic of 40%. That settles in '23 at 33%. So the dot-com business was off 1 point for where stores were in the first quarter, pretty consistent with what we expected. I would tell you that on the big headline with respect to both stores and digital is the traffic has been relatively good. So basically flattish online, slightly up in stores, conversion down in both at about the same rate. So we do expect that this is the reset year with the penetration between them, but we do expect more aggressive growth in digital in the future versus stores as we think about '24 and beyond.And that's going to be [hoisted] by a lot of ideas and strategies, the one of the big ones is going to be what we're doing with Marketplace. Marketplace had an outstanding first quarter. We're in the beginning stages of it. But to Oliver's earlier question, we're very excited to have about Marketplace is really attracting the Gen Z customer, particularly in categories where it was not economically feasible for us to carry in the past. So when it relates to the way that we kind of plan inventory, I think that outside of what happened to us in spring with spring seasonal content and seeing the drop off in sell-throughs across all different value buckets, everything else has pretty much performed as we expected it. Again, just to remind, we have a very healthy reserve. So if we're buying into a sales plan, we hold back in the receipts. We've worked all that out by our new model of working at upfront costing versus working on an MDA model or a markdown allowance model that we used to have in the past. So we're not buying really needless receipts where we have not seen the signal for customer demand, and we are not perfect here. We have so much opportunity. We've got a really good pricing science as it relates to how we mark down goods. We are developing much better pricing science in how we promote goods based on demand signals and personalized marketing and just the opportunities that we see there as well as being very responsive to where in common items like Levi or wherever it might be, a lot of retailers carry but making sure that we're well priced, so that the customer is not disappointed with our values versus a competitor. So all that goes into the mix. And I would just say that inventory control, not a lot of surprises outside of what we talked about in terms of spring seasonal sell-through.Adrian V. MitchellThe one thing I would add, just to amplify a few things on the inventory. Going back to the question earlier around the importance of volume mix and content. As we think about the volume, we've already made adjustments for the back half to align with our sales volume expectations for the balance of the year. The important actions were taken in Q2 to minimize liability going into the back half really gets into the mix for the back half of the year.The one thing I would amplify that Jeff spoke to earlier is we're gifting the destination. And when you think about the shift in our content getting into the back half, we're going to be leaning more into beauty and gifting, which is 30% of our business in the first quarter but exceeds 40% in the fourth quarter. And the beauty business has been growing going through the first quarter. So we feel that we're really moving ourselves into a position of strength. And with newness, we'll have more newness this year than we did last year. And you don't want to forget about the Disney distortion and toys as well as Nike being in the fourth quarter.OperatorThe next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonI just have a couple for the group here. First, I know that higher private label penetration was an opportunity for the year. So I'm just wondering where that stands now and if your view has changed at all there? And then second, just a quick follow-up on the cost savings question from earlier do you still plan to invest in people and tech in the same way you've outlined last quarter? Or has anything been pared back there on the demand slowdown?Adrian V. MitchellAlex, could you repeat your question on the SG&amp;A or the cost savings, we didn't quite catch it. Our apologies.Alexandra Ann StratonNo problem. The question was just do you still plan to invest in people and tech in the same way that you outlined last quarter or if that's been pared back at all on the demand slowdown?Adrian V. MitchellGot you.Jeffrey GennetteAlex, let me take the private brand, and then Adrian will take the second part of your question. Our ambition on private brands remains the same. So it was 16% of our penetration. We do see that growing over time. And as you've heard us talk about in this particular call about INC and Club Room, which have been brands that have been touched and basically -- they basically have been burnished. So they're performing quite well. And then when you look at what we've got coming, we've got a whole portfolio. We have 24 private brands that are all being touched over the next 2.5 years. So we're in the middle of that right now.So the first brand new one is coming in the summer, and we'll stay tuned on all the details of that, but it is across accessories, it's across women's. It does address those key basics that we're talking about seasonal-based -- seasonless basics. We're actually quite excited about where that will be, and we'll give you a full rundown on that. But we do think that the private brands will raise in penetration in out years and it is why it's one of the big growth factors. -- not only is the -- when you look at the [Mugs] opportunity, the margin opportunity. But really importantly, when you look at the five things that we are doing with private brand, brand identity against customer types, original design, really strong strategic sourcing, relevant size and fit, which is one of the biggest pain points for our customer and, of course, compelling value. So we're very bullish on private brands and look forward to sharing all of those learnings and as we develop those strategies and launch them.Adrian V. MitchellAlex, I think what you're hearing from Tony, Jeff and I today is the importance of navigating the near term in terms of what's in front of us, but not losing sight and clarity about the long term. So in terms of being prudent about what's happening in the current environment and the uncertainty that's out there, we've accelerated the $200 million this year, which will translate to $300 million to $350 million in cost savings next year. We've reduced our capital spend from $1 billion to $950 million in terms of our current projections for this year. The key thing to keep in mind is that we will continue to invest in growth, whether that be tech, whether that be people. So as we move through this uncertain period, we're taking the necessary aggressive actions to protect growth investments that will get us to positive growth and profitable growth in future years. So we'll continue to drive efficiencies in our operating model. We'll continue to invest in the growth vectors, and we'll find ways to be more productive with our assets.OperatorThe next question is coming from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett.Charles P. GromJeff, you talked about flowing product closer to need, and I think that's interesting and important for the business. And I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on that a little bit further and how deep the conversations have been on that front with some of your suppliers?Jeffrey GennetteYes, Chuck. So as I mentioned, when you look at the receipt reserve, that is always available to respond in season. So we're not allocating that in advance. So when we cut back, we went to kind of the upfront cost model versus the MDA model that gave us all of the liquidity that we wanted to build into the system. And that when a customer is signaling something in season, we're able to jump on that. So that is a discipline that has been well honed over the past year that you will see play out for the balance of the year.We did, though, do receive cuts when you look at total to make sure that we retain that liquidity, and we didn't take our full reserve to respond to where we took sales down for the balance of the year. So there were conversations that we had with brands. We see downtrend in categories that are not doing well to ensure that we're able to put the right receipts against those categories that are trending. This is a balanced conversation for us. Every single merchant knows that those receipts are really company assets to serve our customers and not their own.And that has -- expect that discipline to continue with us. So as soon as -- I mean we're ordering every single week based on how things are trending. And as I mentioned, we find there's plenty of inventory in the market to be able to respond to that.Charles P. GromOkay. Helpful. And then from a category perspective, I wonder if you could just elaborate across the board, what you saw in apparel and other areas. And in particular, you called out textiles and top of table and housewares improving which is interesting. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that and what that tells you about trends over the next few quarters in that area.Jeffrey GennetteYes. So what we're seeing right now in apparel is that when you think about the bulk of our drop in the first quarter from our expectations has been in the seasonal categories in men's, women's and kids. So that would be all the spring and early summer content. And again, too early to tell whether or not that is content or whether or not that is environment. So we're working through that right now. But we're going to -- as mentioned, all the pricing that we are taking is to ensure that we have the right number of units going into the third quarter.What's going on in the rest of the business is that you've got pockets of strength in center core. The beauty category continues to be strong across fragrance, color and treatment. You've got the home categories, as you mentioned. Things like textiles has been a real turnaround for us with newness coming, like our [Mugs] opportunity that you're going to see from us in the fourth quarter. The Housewares and the tabletop, they were quite depressed based on coming out of the pandemic and the demand curve there. We're starting to see signs of life there. On our last call, we talked about looking for signs of life there. We started to see that in the first quarter. We really see it in the Bloomingdale's brand right now where the home business is quite robust. We're starting to see signs of that in -- on the Macy's side. So again, when you look at the overall categories, I think to a comment that Adrian made to Paul Lejuez' question earlier, what you need to look at is look at the categories and how they penetrate in each quarter. So this idea about beauty and gifting being our two strengths that are trending positively in the first quarter and having a much higher penetration of those in the fourth quarter is our confidence in where we completely de-risked our plan for what we know today with our customers today for the back half of the year. And we feel like our guide is appropriate and conservative for what we see in the customer underpinning.OperatorWe're showing time for one final question today. The final question is coming from Jay Sole of UBS.Jay Daniel SoleI wanted to ask about this new Nike partnership. Maybe can you just tell us a little bit about how that partnership came together? And maybe how big was NIKE as a percent of sales back the last time Macy’'s had it? And do you expect this to be like a long-term partnership? Or is this getting inventory for a couple of quarters and then sort of we'll see from there?Jeffrey GennetteLong-term partnership. So I look at it as we took a pause. We've been out of the Nike brand outside of where we are in footwear and certain license businesses in the kids really for the last 1.5 years. And we're committing to a long-term partnership together and our opportunity to basically provide our customer a multi-brand or a multi-category experience that is elevated and enhanced. And so we're not quoting what we used to do, but obviously, it's one of the most important brands for our customer.We had lots of customers that were disappointed that we didn't carry it over the past year. So this is very important to uniform for many of our customers. It gives [heft] to the balance of our active assortments. We're excited about things like our Reebok engagement, obviously, what we're doing with the other brands. This is going to be, we believe, a real catalyst without cannibalizing much else in the balance of the apparel assortments. So this is a win for us. And we think it's a win for Nike.When you look at our 40 million-plus customers that come to us for curation across multi-categories and wanting Nike. So those are the conversations that we had with Nike Management on the pause that we took. So you're going to see it come in, in the month of October. You have it in apparel, that's including plus size women's, it's big and tall men's -- it's the kids area that we weren't carrying it through the licensed areas. It's badge, It's gear. It's going to be in key locations, obviously, online and then expands out to many, many more locations as we get into '24. Our finish line business has been quite strong, and so that will continue in all the doors that we have in today.OperatorThank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gannette for closing comments.Jeffrey GennetteJust thank you, everybody, for your interest in Macy's, and everybody, have a great summer. Look forward to talking to you again in August with our first -- with our second quarter results.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.]"

Shares have lost about 1.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pfizer due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Q1 Earnings Beat, COVID Jab Sales Down as ExpectedPfizer’s first-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales.Pfizer reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.23, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 per share as well as our estimate of $1.05 per share. Earnings declined 24% year over year.Revenues came in at $18.28 billion, down 29% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis, reflecting an operational decline of 26% and currency headwinds of 3%. The decline, as expected, in direct sales and alliance revenues from BioNTech for Comirnaty hurt total revenues in the quarter. One fewer selling day in international markets also hurt the top line in the quarter.However total revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion.Excluding revenues from COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, sales rose 5% operationally. Higher sales of key brands like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax globally and Eliquis in the United States were partially offset by weaker sales of Xeljanz and Ibrance globally. Newly acquired products like Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbrytaa and higher revenues of anti-infective Sulperazon in China also contributed to the top line.International revenues declined 37% to $9.78 billion. U.S. revenues declined 5% to $8.51 billion.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&amp;A) expenses rose 37% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.35 billion due to increased spending for Paxlovid, new products and recently acquired products. Adjusted R&amp;D expenses rose 10% to $2.49 billion due to costs to develop recently acquired programs and some vaccine candidates.Story continuesSegment DiscussionPfizer reports its revenues under three broad sub-segments of its Biopharma operating segment, Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. Sales in the Primary Care segment declined 37% operationally to $11.51 billion. The Specialty Care unit recorded sales of $3.6 billion, up 8%. Sales of Oncology declined 1% to $2.86 billion.Primary CareIn Primary Care, direct sales and alliance revenues from BioNTech for Comirnaty were $3.06 billion in the quarter, down 75% year over year. Comirnaty sales declined 86% in the United States due to lower contracted deliveries to the U.S. government. Comirnaty sales declined 73% outside U.S. markets due to lower demand and contracted deliveries. Comirnaty sales missed our estimate of $3.51 billion.Paxlovid contributed $4.07 billion to sales in the first quarter, compared with $1.47 billion in the year-ago quarter. Paxlovid sales beat our estimate of $2.57 billion. The favorable timing of final deliveries to the U.S. government, strong demand in China due to increased COVID-19 infections and some international launches boosted Paxlovid’s sales.Alliance revenues from Bristol-Myers (for Eliquis) and direct sales rose 7% to $1.87 billion. Continued oral anti-coagulant adoption and market share gains in non-valvular atrial fibrillation benefited alliance revenues from Eliquis sales in the United States and some European markets. However, generic competition in some international markets hurt sales. Alliance revenues for Eliquis missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 billionGlobal Prevnar family revenues rose 4% to $1.59 billion. The Prevnar family includes revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult). Prevnar revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion.Prevnar sales rose 6% in the United States. Prevnar revenues were flat in international markets.Newly acquired product Nurtec ODT/Vydura contributed $167 million in the first quarter compared with $211 million in the previous quarter. Sales were lower sequentially due to seasonality impact of annual copay reset dynamics. Nurtec ODT/Vydura was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Biohaven in 2022.Specialty CareRare disease drug, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax recorded sales of $686 million in the quarter, up 16% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $711 million.Xeljanz sales declined 33% to $237 million due to lower prices and prescription volumes as doctors’ prescribing patterns shifted away from JAK inhibitors following label warnings.Enbrel revenues declined 22% to $199 million due to continued biosimilar competition in key European markets and Japan.New product, Oxbryta generated sales of $71 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.OncologyIn Oncology, Ibrance revenues declined 5% year over year to $1.14 billion due to planned price decreases in some international developed markets and lower clinical trial purchases. Sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 billion.Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $258 million in the quarter, down 4% year over year. Inlyta revenues were $259 million in the quarter, up 14%.2023 GuidancePfizer maintained its previously issued financial guidance for 2023.Revenues are expected in the range of $67.0 to $71.0 billion, indicating an operational decline of 29 from the 2022 level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged $68.41 billion.The revenue guidance includes approximately $13.5 billion in sales from Comirnaty, down 64% from the 2022 level, and Paxlovid sales of approximately $8 billion, down 58%.Pfizer expects to launch both products in traditional commercial markets in the United States in the second half of 2023 as the company transitions away from the government market due to lower demand.Pfizer expects significantly lower sales from its COVID products in the second quarter versus the first quarter. More substantial deliveries are expected to start in late third quarter in the United States and beginning of the fourth quarter in international markets.Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer expects its revenues to rise 7% to 9% on an operational basis in 2023, with the growth mostly expected to occur in the second half of the year due to the timing of new product launches.Pfizer has the largest number of new product and indication launches planned for 2023, most of which are expected to occur in the second half of the year. Dr. Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer, said that the new product launches coupled with business development activities, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, positions Pfizer strongly for operational growth in 2025 and beyond.Pfizer’s new products Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta revenues declined sequentially in the first quarter due to seasonality impact. However, the new drugs are seeing strong demand trends and better sales are anticipated in the latter quarters.Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, implying an operational decline of 47 from the 2022 level.The expected decline in adjusted earnings is due to lower revenues from COVID products coupled with higher spending for near-term launches and late-stage pipeline candidates.Adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, is expected in the range of 28 of total revenues. Research and development expense is expected in the range of $12.4-$13.4 billion. SI&amp;A spending is expected in the range of $13.8-$14.8 billion. Both SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus 2022 to support the launch of potential new products as well as recently acquired assets.Acquired IPR&amp;D expenses are expected to be approximately $0.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 15% in 2023. Adjusted other (income)/deductions are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion of income.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.46% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Pfizer has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The NDA seeks approval for troriluzole to treat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (“SCA3”), an ultra-rare neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive disability.This NDA is supported by data from a phase III study (BHV4157-206) wherein treatment with troriluzole demonstrated benefits across multiple outcome measures in study participants. Troriluzole has also been granted fast track and orphan drug designations by the FDA in SCA indication. The candidate is also being developed in two late-stage studies for obsessive-compulsive disorder (“OCD”).The company also announced that it expects to complete enrolment in the global phase III study evaluating taldefgrobep alfa, another candidate, in spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) by this year’s end. Management also intends to start a phase II study later this year to evaluate this drug in metabolic disorders.In the year so far, shares of Biohaven have increased 26.2% against the industry’s 9.7% fall.Biohaven also announced several clinical updates on its pre-clinical/early-stage pipeline candidates. It stated that it has advanced BHV-8000, a TYK-1/JAK1 inhibitor for treating brain disorders, to clinical development. Management recently initiated a phase I study to evaluate BHV-8000 in healthy volunteers. The candidate was acquired in March 2023 from China-based Hangzhou Highlightll Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.The firm also revealed its plans to start the phase I EEG study to evaluate BHV-7000, a Kv7.2/3 activator in first-half 2023. Management intends to start pivotal clinical studies evaluating the candidate in focal epilepsy and bipolar disorder indications by this year’s end.Story continuesAlongside the above updates, BHVN plans to submit investigational new drug (IND) applications to the FDA to start clinical studies on multiple pipeline candidates. This includes BHV-1300, a novel IgG degrader, whose IND application is on track for submission later this year.Currently, Biohaven has no marketed drugs in its portfolio and is dependent on its pipeline for growth. The company is a new publicly traded company, which has retained the non-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) development stage pipeline compounds of legacy Biohaven.Last year, the company turned to a new direction after it announced that its CGRP business was acquired by Pfizer PFE for $148.50 per share or an aggregate equity value of $11.6 billion. Following this acquisition, the newly-incorporated Biohaven has been focused on advancing its non-CGRP pipeline compounds targeting neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases like SMA, SCA and OCD. The acquisition also resulted in Pfizer adding legacy Biohaven’s sole marketed drug Nurtec ODT to its product portfolio. Pfizer also added Biohaven’s other CGRP programs, including zavegepant nasal spray to its product portfolio. Zavegepant received FDA approval in March for the acute treatment of migraine. Pfizer is marketing this spray under the brand name Zavzpret.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderBiohaven currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.In the midst of uncertain economic conditions globally, the healthcare sector has displayed a notable degree of resilience. Historically, the demand for healthcare products and services has proven to be relatively inelastic. The healthcare sector’s strength was evident during the equity downturn experienced in 2022 as well, where the sector outperformed broader equity markets. According to BlackRock, healthcare stocks demonstrated 23% less volatility compared to the overall market during the last year. In the past seven recessions, the healthcare sector has consistently surpassed broad market performance by an average margin of 10%. Furthermore, over the span of the last six recessions, earnings within the industry have experienced an average growth of 21%. Some of the best healthcare stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Like many other industries, the healthcare sector underwent significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report released by Deloitte, approximately 70% of the global population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.  As the global economy returns to the new normal and the COVID-19 pandemic moves towards the endemic stage, the healthcare sector is adapting to new trends to shape its future outlook. One notable shift in the industry is the increasing virtualization of care, which has not only transformed the way healthcare services are delivered but has also attracted new players in the industry. For instance, in 2021, the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente jointly invested $110 million into Medically Home Group, a venture company focused on hospital-at-home services.Story continuesIndustry's Growth TrajectoryThe delivery of healthcare services is no longer restricted to healthcare companies only, but leading technology and retail companies are now making a play at it as well. In November 2021, leading electronics retailer Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) invested $400 million to acquire the care-at-home platform Current Health. Meanwhile, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also partnered with Zimmer Biomet to develop remote sensors that could be installed in smartphones and smartwatches and used to track the recovery of patients following their knee replacement surgery. As per Deloitte, the remote monitoring devices segment is expected to gain more mainstream attention as its size is forecasted to increase from $30 billion in 2021 to $101 billion in 2028. This reflects an annual average growth rate of 18.9%.The overall demand for the healthcare sector can be gauged by the fact that one in three adults across the world has chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as of 2023. Meanwhile, one in every four individuals is expected to experience a form of mental illness during their life. According to Deloitte, over a period of 20 years, the world is expected to face an economic loss of $16.3 trillion due to mental illnesses. However, despite the rising demand for healthcare services, the sector’s ability to deliver remains constrained due to numerous factors. Around $935 billion, or 25% of the US healthcare expenditure, is wasted due to administrative red tape or inefficiencies, pricing irregularity, and labour shortages. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a shortage of 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals by 2035. Experts think an active adoption of technology and virtual delivery systems can help overcome such a significant shortage of healthcare professionals in the near future.15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe initially compiled an extensive list of companies actively involved in the healthcare sector.

(NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”13. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a Nashville, Tennessee-based healthcare services company founded in 1968. The company operates a vast network of hospitals, outpatient centres, and other healthcare facilities across the US and UK. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is expanding its presence in Texas as it announced the acquisition of 41 urgent care centres from FastMed earlier this month. Presently, the company has 92 urgent care centres along with 45 hospitals and 395 physician practices present in the Lone Star State. HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Meanwhile, labor expenses, which have weighed heavily on operating margins, appear to be reversing as extra headcount brought on to accommodate spikes in patient volumes due to COVID is finally subsiding.”12. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a San Diego, California-based medical device company founded in 1999 that specializes in the development and manufacturing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Matthew Blackman at Stifel increased the price target on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) from $130 to $140 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock in an investment note issued on April 28. The analyst shared that the company’s Q1 2023 results checked “all the important boxes,” in his opinion.Baron Funds shared its outlook on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”11. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67On May 18, Richard Newitter at Truist raised the price target on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) from $325 to $347 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. In April 2023, the stock price of the Sunnyvale, California-based robotic surgical system producer recorded the highest increase in three years following the release of the company’s Q1 2023 results. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) saw its revenue increase by 13.4% YoY to $1.69 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast of $1.68 billion. Meanwhile, the adjusted EPS was posted at $1.23 and was three cents higher than analysts' forecast.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.”10. Biogen Inc.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced positive results from the Phase 3 program comprising the REVISIT (NCT03329092) and ASSEMBLE (NCT03580044) studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the novel investigational antibiotic combination aztreonam-avibactam (ATM-AVI) in treating serious bacterial infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, including metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing multidrug-resistant pathogens for which there are limited or no treatment options. Data support that ATM-AVI is effective and well-tolerated, with no new safety findings and a similar safety profile to aztreonam alone.""We believe these data demonstrate that ATM-AVI, if approved, could be an important treatment option for patients with life-threatening bacterial infections that are resistant to almost all currently available antibiotics,"" said James Rusnak, Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine, Anti-Infectives and Hospital, Pfizer. ""We are committed to meeting this critical need and helping to address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance.""The REVISIT study compared ATM-AVI ± metronidazole (MTZ) with meropenem (MER) ± colistin (COL) for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Key results include:For patients with cIAI, cure rate in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis set was 76.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) [70.3, 81.8]) for the ATM-AVI ± MTZ treatment arm vs 74.0% (95% CI [65.0, 81.7]) for the MER ± COL treatment arm, with a treatment difference of 2.4% (95% CI [-12.4, 19.1]). In the clinically evaluable (CE) analysis set, cure rate was 85.1% (95% CI [79.2, 89.9]) for ATM-AVI ± MTZ versus 79.5% (95% CI [69.9, 87.1]) for MER ± COL.For patients with HAP/VAP, cure rate in the ITT analysis set was 45.9% (95% CI [34.9, 57.3]) for ATM-AVI ± MTZ versus 41.7% (95% CI [26.7, 57.9]) for MER ± COL, with a treatment difference of 4.3% (95% CI [-25.6, 32.2]). In the CE analysis set, cure rate was 46.7% (95% CI [32.7, 61.1]) for ATM-AVI ± MTZ vs 54.5% (95% CI [34.3, 73.7]) for MER ± COL.All-cause 28-day mortality rates were 4/208 (1.9%) for ATM-AVI ± MTZ versus 3/104 (2.9%) for MER ± COL in cIAI, and 8/74 (10.8%) for ATM-AVI ± MTZ versus 7/36 (19.4%) for MER ± COL in HAP/VAP.ATM-AVI ± MTZ was well-tolerated, with an overall observed pattern of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in line with that described for aztreonam alone. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar between treatment groups (53 [19.3%] patients in the ATM-AVI ± MTZ group and 25 [18.2%] patients in the MER ± COL group). No patient treated with ATM-AVI ± MTZ experienced a treatment-related SAE.Story continuesThese results are further supported by the ASSEMBLE study, which found that 5/12 (41.7%) of the ATM-AVI ± MTZ patients with infections due to confirmed MBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria were cured at TOC versus 0/3 (0%) of those on best available therapy (BAT). ATM-AVI patients experienced TEAEs that were in line with those of aztreonam alone. No patient treated with ATM-AVI experienced a treatment-related SAE.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, is widely recognized as one of the biggest threats to global health and developing new treatments for infections caused by these bacteria has been highlighted as a critical area of need by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 An estimated 1.27 million deaths globally were caused by bacterial AMR in 2019 alone.2 Without solutions, a continued rise of AMR could make routine medical procedures too risky to perform.3""These clinical findings show that ATM-AVI, if approved, could help provide coverage against Gram-negative bacteria without compromising on efficacy or safety,"" said Yehuda Carmeli, Head, National Institute for Antibiotic Resistance and Infection Control, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. ""These data are particularly promising given the complexities of managing cIAI and HAP/VAP infections in these hospitalized, critically ill patients, and the challenges of real-world patient recruitment within this population.""Full results from the studies will be submitted for scientific publication. Data from the REVISIT and ASSEMBLE studies are expected to form the basis for planned regulatory filings in the European Union, United Kingdom, China, and the U.S. in the second half of 2023. Pfizer holds the global rights to commercialize ATM-AVI outside of the U.S. and Canada, where the rights are held by its development partner AbbVie.These studies were sponsored by Pfizer and funded in whole or part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under OTA number HHSO100201500029C. The research leading to these results has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking under grant agreement 115620, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies in kind contribution. Additional information about the studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov under the identifiers NCT03329092 and NCT03580044.About the Aztreonam-Avibactam (ATM-AVI) Phase 3 Development ProgramThe Phase 3 development program for ATM-AVI is comprised of two studies: REVISIT and ASSEMBLE. These studies were not designed for inferential testing of efficacy, but do provide randomized, assessor-blinded descriptive efficacy data and contribute to the safety database. This streamlined development approach for ATM-AVI has been confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).REVISIT is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, open label, central assessor blinded, parallel group comparative study conducted with 422 hospitalized adult patients across 81 locations in 20 countries. The study was to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ATM-AVI ± MTZ versus MER ± COL in the treatment of hospitalized adults with cIAI or nosocomial pneumonia including HAP and VAP, in regions with endemic or emerging carbapenem resistance, and where MBL-producing multidrug-resistant pathogens are suspected.ASSEMBLE is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel group comparator study conducted with 15 adult patients across 12 locations in 9 countries. The study was to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ATM-AVI versus BAT in the treatment of hospitalized adults with infections confirmed due to MBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria.About Aztreonam-Avibactam (ATM-AVI)Aztreonam-avibactam (ATM-AVI) is an investigational treatment for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with limited treatment options.4,5,6 It combines aztreonam, a monobactam β-lactam, with avibactam, a recent broad-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitor.5,6 Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are a class of β-lactamase enzymes which are not inhibited by current β-lactamase inhibitors and hydrolyze nearly all β-lactam antibiotics, the exception being monobactams such as aztreonam. However, monobactams are degraded by other β-lactamases that are frequently co-produced with MBLs, limiting the clinical usefulness of aztreonam monotherapy.The combination of aztreonam with avibactam restores aztreonam’s activity against bacteria that co-produce MBLs and other β-lactamases and, if approved, could offer a much-needed safe and effective treatment option against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.5ATM-AVI is being jointly developed with AbbVie. Pfizer holds the global rights to commercialize this investigative therapy outside of the U.S. and Canada, where the rights are held by AbbVie. Development of ATM-AVI is also supported by public-private partnerships between Pfizer and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and between Pfizer and the European Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) – a partnership between the European Union and the European pharmaceutical industry, under a project called COMBACTE-CARE (Combating Bacterial Resistance in Europe – Carbapenem Resistance). The COMBACTE-CARE consortium is a unique public-private collaboration that unites the knowledge and capabilities of leading drug resistant bacterial infection experts and is supported by the COMBACTE clinical and laboratory networks.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Shares have lost about 4.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Petroleum due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marathon Q1 Earnings Top on Margin Gains, Buyback RaisedIndependent oil refiner and marketer, Marathon Petroleum Corporation reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.09, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 and compared with a profit of merely $1.49 per share in the year-ago period.The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.9%.In October 2022, the company completed its target of buying back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp; Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion.In the first quarter, MPC repurchased $3.2 billion of shares and a further $1.2 billion worth of shares in April. The company, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $9 billion.Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $768 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and refined product sales that more than offset lower capacity utilization.Story continuesSpecifically, the refining margin of $26.15 per barrel improved significantly from $15.31 a year ago. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 89% compared to 91% in the corresponding period of 2022. The tickdown reflects planned maintenance activity in the Gulf Coast region. The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $768 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and refined product sales that more than offset lower capacity utilization.Meanwhile, total refined product sales volumes were 3,352 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,293 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput also edged up from 2,833 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,837 mbpd but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,851 mbpd.Further, operating costs per barrel increased 8.8% year over year to $5.68. The cost escalation was blamed on turnaround-related outgo.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 13.2% from the first quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.   Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 13.2% from the first quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Costs, Capex &amp; Balance Sheet  In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $690 million on capital programs (61% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $573 million in the year-ago period. As of Mar 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 45.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -24.01% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Marathon Petroleum has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Marathon Petroleum has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

207,31fe80c7-2ff8-3e76-80a9-c41617edab42,MPC,2023-06-02,EnerSys and Sphere Entertainment have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enersys-sphere-entertainment-highlighted-zacks-122100351.html,1685622060,STORY,"['ENS', 'PSX', 'EOG', 'MPC', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 1, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares EnerSys ENS as the Bull of the Day and Sphere Entertainment SPHR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:EnerSys stock is standing out this earnings season after impressively surpassing its fiscal fourth-quarter EPS estimates on May 24.As a leader in stored energy solutions for industrial products, EnerSys was able to capitalize on its pricing power and increase organic growth. Notably, the Manufacturing-Electronics Industry is in the top 10% of over 250 Zacks industries which further bolsters EnerSys' Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).EnerSys remains well-positioned as a distributor of various industrial batteries, battery chargers, and other power equipment along with outdoor cabinet solutions. Already up +31% this year, there could be legs to the rally in EnerSys stock which scores an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.Q4 ReviewEnerSys achieved record net sales and operating earnings during the fourth quarter. Impressively, earnings came in 32% above EPS expectations at $1.82 per share compared to estimates of $1.38 a share. Fourth-quarter earnings also soared 51% from the prior-year quarter. On the top line, sales surpassed estimates by 4% at $989.90 million and rose 9% year over year.The impressive top and bottom line growth during Q4 also helped EnerSys achieve record numbers in annual sales and earnings. Total sales for EnerSys’ fiscal 2023 came in at $3.7 billion and increased 10% YoY with EPS of $5.34 jumping 19% from a year ago.Record Growth ContinuesMaking EnerSys stock more attractive is that its record fiscal 2023 is expected to be eclipsed going forward. EnerSys’ earnings are expected to soar 28% in its current fiscal 2024 and climb another 19% in FY25 at $8.19 per share.Story continuesFiscal 2025 projections represent 82% EPS growth over the last five years with 2021 earnings at $4.49 per share. Total sales are forecasted to be up 4% in FY24 and rise another 4% in FY25 to $4.04 billion.Bottom LineNow appears to be an ideal time to buy EnerSys stock as the company is poised to continue achieving record growth on its top and bottom lines. While there could certainly be more upside in shares of ENS this year, EnerSys stock is also becoming a very sound investment for 2023 and beyond.Bear of the Day:Sphere Entertainment currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as the company has moved futher away from profitability at the moment.The road ahead may be bumpy upon Sphere's spinoff from Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSG) on April 20. Sphere’s first independent venue is currently under construction in Las Vegas and will weigh on its bottom line with the company planning to open a second venue in London as well.Furthermore, Sphere’s two regional television networks, MSG Network and MSG Sportsnet will naturally face increasing competition from a plethora of streaming services.Declining Earnings EstimatesAlluding to the challenges ahead and the near-term impact of potentially opening a second venue in London is the decline in fiscal 2024 earnings estimates. Fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have largely declined from projections of $2.54 per share a month ago to forecast of an adjusted loss of -$1.77 a share.While earnings estimates for the current year have gone up, an adjusted loss of -$5.43 a share is still expected.Spinoff PerformanceTrading at $23 a share, the declining earnings estimates point to more volatility and downside risk ahead for Sphere stock. To that point, shares of SPHR dropped -20% in May and are now down -60% since its spinoff from Madison Square Garden.Bottom LineAlthough Sphere has a vision of being a next-generation entertainment company its growth potential from live performances is still a few years away. For now, investors may want to stay on the sidelines as declining earnings estimates for FY24 have dimmed Sphere’s outlook.Additional content:3 Dividend Stocks to Gain Despite Energy Market VolatilitySince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the market has witnessed wild swings in oil prices. This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby setting Marathon Petroleum Corp., EOG Resources, Inc. and Phillips 66 up for growth.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at close to $70 per barrel.Dividend Stocks to Keep an Eye OnOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.3 Stocks to GainMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. MPC is well poised to gain on strong refining fundamentals, backed by the reduction in refining capacity across the world. It pays out a quarterly dividend of 75 cents ($3.00 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.78% yield at the current stock price.

208,94713062-8648-3bb2-9a01-921b964ac8ea,TAP,2023-06-02,Molson Coors (TAP) Down 4.8% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-tap-down-4-153112607.html,1685633472,STORY,"['TAP-A', 'SAM']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Molson Coors Brewing (TAP). Shares have lost about 4.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Molson Coors due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Molson Coors’ Q1 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat EstimatesMolson Coors reported first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Results gained from strength in core brands, as well as the above premium portfolio and contributions from its Revitalization Plan.Quarterly DetailsThe company’s adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share surged 86.2% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents and our estimate of 22 cents.Net sales grew 5.9% to $2,346.3 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,230 million and our estimate of $2,217 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 8.2%, driven by favorable price and sales mix, which was offset by a slight decline in financial volume.Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from premiumization.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 2.1% to 16.2 million due to sluggishness in America, as well as in EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 17 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) advanced 89% year over year to $157.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, EBT surged 82.8% owing to higher net pricing and a positive sales mix, somewhat offset by cost inflation related to materials, conversion and energy costs.Story continuesSegmental InformationMolson Coors operates under the following geographical segments.Americas: Net sales in the segment increased 5.6% to $1,939 million on a reported basis and rose 6.5% on a constant-currency basis, driven by price and sales mix, offset by a decline in financial volume. Financial volumes dipped 0.5% year over year due to industry softness, lower Latin America financial volumes and weak contract volumes, offset by higher U.S. domestic shipments.Brand volume for the segment dropped 1.5% on a 1.2% decline in the United States, owing to softer industry performance and lower economy portfolio volumes. Canada brand volumes rose 4.9% due to growth in core brands and partly due to cycling softer on-premise performance in the prior year. Meanwhile, Latin America declined 12.4% due to industry softness in some of the major markets.Net sales per hectoliter rose 6.1% due to a favorable sales mix and higher net pricing, offset by currency woes. Underlying EBT improved 37.7% on a constant-currency basis to $233.9 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing and a favorable sales mix, offset by cost inflation on materials, conversion and energy costs.EMEA&amp;APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) grew 7.6% to $410.1 million and improved 16.1% on a constant-currency basis, driven by favorable price and sales mix, and an increase in financial volume. Net sales per hectoliter for the segment advanced 6.7%, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing offset by currency headwinds. The segment’s financial volumes rose 0.8% due to growth in the above-premium volumes in the U.K. and higher factored volumes offset by inflationary pressures. Brand volume decreased 3.9% due to volume declines resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflationary pressures, somewhat offset by growth in Western Europe.The segment’s underlying EBT increased 30% to a loss of $21.8 million on a reported basis and improved 28% on a constant-currency basis, driven by higher net pricing to customers, favorable sales mix and higher financial volumes, which offset cost inflation, particularly in materials, transportation and energy costs, as well as higher MG&amp;A spend.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $328.2 million. At the end of first-quarter 2023, the company had a total debt of $6,590.4 million, resulting in net debt of $6,262.2 million.As of Mar 31, 2022, the company provided $3.4 million in cash by operating activities, resulting in an underlying free cash flow of $173.7 million. For 2023, capital expenditure is likely to be $700 million, plus or minus 5%. In the quarter under review, the company declared and paid out cash dividends of 41 cents per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling 0.55 per share. As of Mar 31, 2022, TAP repurchased 275,000 shares for $14,6 million.OutlookManagement retained the 2023 view. Net sales are projected to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $690 million, plus or minus 5%. The company expects an underlying effective tax rate of 21-23%. Consolidated net interest expenses are anticipated to be $240 million, plus or minus 5%. Underlying free cash flow is likely to be $1 billion, plus or minus 10%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 10.08% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Molson Coors has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMolson Coors belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry. Another stock from the same industry, Boston Beer (SAM), has gained 10.8% over the past month.

""Buy-side client expectations are in the $6-8 million per month consumer outflow range should this happen, per our conversations, which represents a potential 1-2 point [comparable] headwind to retail spending.""Horvers slashed his rating to Neutral from Overweight. His new price target is $133, down from $182.Target stock was relatively unchanged at $130 on Thursday afternoon.The new debt ceiling agreement between the White House and Republicans prohibits President Joe Biden from extending the student loan forbearance. Payments will restart on Sept. 1.This comes as the Supreme Court is slated to rule this month on the legality of Biden's plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student loans per borrower.The payment restart could have a negative impact on the economy and, by extension, discretionary goods retailers such as Target.""The impact on spending is likely to be modest in the medium-term,"" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius in new research today. ""We estimate student loan repayments will subtract 0.2 percentage points from personal consumption expenditures growth this year if the student loan forgiveness plan is struck down or 0.1 percentage point if the plan stands.""For the sector more broadly, that means more challenges ahead for some already troubled retailers.""The issue of debt is absolutely something that the retail industry — particularly some of the most distressed retailers — are absolutely grappling with, and that’s a challenge,"" Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You have two things working against you: You have the fact that demand may be softening at a time where you also have your payments to make and it is not as easy to borrow.""Story continuesKodali added that this would ""most likely"" lead to more retail bankruptcies in the next 12 to 24 months.Carts are brought into a Target store on May 18, 2022, in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)For Target, the student loan news arrives at a terrible time.The company's decision last week to remove some LGBTQ-themed merchandise after customer backlash has triggered even more global backlash.Shares are down by about 14% in the past week and a half as investors worry about potential second quarter sales and profit hits from the high-profile unrest.Meanwhile, Target is coming off another quarter of challenged sales as inflation-battered shoppers curtailed discretionary purchases such as apparel and home goods. Historically, these are bread-and-butter sellers for Target — and key profit margin enhancers.Alleged organized crime at Target stores is also weighing on results, execs have said.Horvers thinks cautious consumer spending warrants a more cautious take on Target's stock, aside from the student loan repayment issue.""We continue to believe that the consumer is broadly weakening while the share of wallet shifts away from goods (51% of Target sales) is ongoing,"" Horvers added.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.In the midst of uncertain economic conditions globally, the healthcare sector has displayed a notable degree of resilience. Historically, the demand for healthcare products and services has proven to be relatively inelastic. The healthcare sector’s strength was evident during the equity downturn experienced in 2022 as well, where the sector outperformed broader equity markets. According to BlackRock, healthcare stocks demonstrated 23% less volatility compared to the overall market during the last year. In the past seven recessions, the healthcare sector has consistently surpassed broad market performance by an average margin of 10%. Furthermore, over the span of the last six recessions, earnings within the industry have experienced an average growth of 21%. Some of the best healthcare stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Like many other industries, the healthcare sector underwent significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report released by Deloitte, approximately 70% of the global population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.  As the global economy returns to the new normal and the COVID-19 pandemic moves towards the endemic stage, the healthcare sector is adapting to new trends to shape its future outlook. One notable shift in the industry is the increasing virtualization of care, which has not only transformed the way healthcare services are delivered but has also attracted new players in the industry. For instance, in 2021, the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente jointly invested $110 million into Medically Home Group, a venture company focused on hospital-at-home services.Story continuesIndustry's Growth TrajectoryThe delivery of healthcare services is no longer restricted to healthcare companies only, but leading technology and retail companies are now making a play at it as well. In November 2021, leading electronics retailer Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) invested $400 million to acquire the care-at-home platform Current Health. Meanwhile, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also partnered with Zimmer Biomet to develop remote sensors that could be installed in smartphones and smartwatches and used to track the recovery of patients following their knee replacement surgery. As per Deloitte, the remote monitoring devices segment is expected to gain more mainstream attention as its size is forecasted to increase from $30 billion in 2021 to $101 billion in 2028. This reflects an annual average growth rate of 18.9%.The overall demand for the healthcare sector can be gauged by the fact that one in three adults across the world has chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as of 2023. Meanwhile, one in every four individuals is expected to experience a form of mental illness during their life. According to Deloitte, over a period of 20 years, the world is expected to face an economic loss of $16.3 trillion due to mental illnesses. However, despite the rising demand for healthcare services, the sector’s ability to deliver remains constrained due to numerous factors. Around $935 billion, or 25% of the US healthcare expenditure, is wasted due to administrative red tape or inefficiencies, pricing irregularity, and labour shortages. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a shortage of 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals by 2035. Experts think an active adoption of technology and virtual delivery systems can help overcome such a significant shortage of healthcare professionals in the near future.15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe initially compiled an extensive list of companies actively involved in the healthcare sector. Next, we used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 to identify the stocks that attracted the highest number of hedge fund investors during the quarter. The best healthcare stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund ownership. We have also discussed the analyst ratings and growth prospects of companies to provide our readers with further investment context.Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now15. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SRPT) by over 90% during Q1 2023.14. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60On May 16, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was upgraded from a Market Perform to an Outperform rating, and the target price was revised from $90 to $100 by Evan Seigerman at BMO Capital. The analyst highlighted that the Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company has the “best-in-class” cell therapy portfolio that is backed by a stellar manufacturing ability. Furthermore, the company is also focused on improving its solid tumour oncology division by bringing Trodelvy into its portfolio by getting the drug’s commercialization rights in the Asian market from Everest Medicines.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”13. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a Nashville, Tennessee-based healthcare services company founded in 1968. The company operates a vast network of hospitals, outpatient centres, and other healthcare facilities across the US and UK. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is expanding its presence in Texas as it announced the acquisition of 41 urgent care centres from FastMed earlier this month. Presently, the company has 92 urgent care centres along with 45 hospitals and 395 physician practices present in the Lone Star State. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) has made an investment outlay of $6.6 billion in the last six years in the state. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 0.86% as of May 29.Renaissance Investment Management shared its stance on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Lastly, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) was another contributor. The company is seeing solid improvements in surgical volumes and overall healthcare usage. Meanwhile, labor expenses, which have weighed heavily on operating margins, appear to be reversing as extra headcount brought on to accommodate spikes in patient volumes due to COVID is finally subsiding.”12. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a San Diego, California-based medical device company founded in 1999 that specializes in the development and manufacturing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Matthew Blackman at Stifel increased the price target on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) from $130 to $140 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock in an investment note issued on April 28. The analyst shared that the company’s Q1 2023 results checked “all the important boxes,” in his opinion.Baron Funds shared its outlook on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”11. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67On May 18, Richard Newitter at Truist raised the price target on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) from $325 to $347 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. In April 2023, the stock price of the Sunnyvale, California-based robotic surgical system producer recorded the highest increase in three years following the release of the company’s Q1 2023 results. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) saw its revenue increase by 13.4% YoY to $1.69 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast of $1.68 billion. Meanwhile, the adjusted EPS was posted at $1.23 and was three cents higher than analysts' forecast.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.”10. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) secured tenth position on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy now. On May 11, an analyst at Argus raised the price target on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) from $320 to $350 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst noted that the acceptance of a supplemental biologics license application by the FDA for Leqembi for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s could be a growth catalyst for Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock. Furthermore, the review of Lecanemab in China, Europe, and Japan and, subsequently, its approval in these markets could provide further impetus to the growth outlook of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB).9. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based provider of health insurance products and services to individuals, employers, and government-sponsored programs.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is likely to be approved for obesity in 2023. Lilly has two new obesity drugs advancing into Phase 3 trials. Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations, and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”6. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73On May 18, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) received encouraging news as an independent panel of experts at the US FDA recommended the approval of Abrysvo, a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE). This vaccine is specifically designed to be administered to mothers and aims to prevent respiratory disorders associated with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in newborns.

(NASDAQ:ADI) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.52bUS$4.90bUS$5.45bUS$6.53bUS$7.04bUS$7.42bUS$7.74bUS$8.03bUS$8.29bUS$8.53bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$109bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$109b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$42bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$81b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Analog Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.342. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Analog DevicesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.MetLife (MET) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.52 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.2%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.08% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.84%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 4.17%. Check MetLife (MET) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Perrigo (PRGO) is paying out a dividend of $0.27 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.42% compared to the Medical - Products industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5% over the past year. Check Perrigo (PRGO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.2 per share, Regions Financial (RF) has a dividend yield of 4.63%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.82% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 17.65%. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

V reported somewhat mixed results for May, showing both booming e-commerce businesses and lower-than-expected card payments volume growth in the domestic market. The financial transaction juggernaut witnessed only 5% year-over-year growth in U.S. payments volume last month.The metric witnessed a 5% increase in the quarter-to-date period. For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. payments volume growth is pegged at 6.7%. Hence, V has a considerable stretch left to cover in the third month.

Similarly, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $8.58, suggesting 14.4% growth from a year ago.Per the regulatory filing by Visa, its processed transaction growth numbers have declined considerably from the start of the year. While card not present volume increased 7% year over year in May, card present volume only climbed 3%. This can signify that e-commerce businesses are still prospering, at least at a better degree than brick-and-mortar businesses.Its global processed transactions jumped 9% in the month from the prior-year period. The volume was 153% of the 2019 level. Credit payments volume in the United States increased 5% in May while debit payments rose 6%. These growth percentages are sequentially flat from April.Total cross-border volume increased 17% year over year in May, following a 19% jump in April. Excluding intra-Europe transactions, cross-border volume rose 21% year over year in May and 26% in April.

Even though there was a belief just six months ago that “crypto winter” would persist well into 2023, investors are on the lookout for the best cryptos to buy.That said — risks exist and, in the crypto world, they are more pronounced. If we are headed into a recession, the question most investors ask is how to gain exposure to this asset class in a low-risk way.Here are three cryptos to buy for the second half in the year for such investors:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBTC-USDBitcoin$26,661.60AVAX-USDAvalanche$14.42SOL-USDSolana$19.39Bitcoin (BTC-USD)A Bitcoin coin sitting on a mossy piece of wood.Source: ShutterstockBitcoin (BTC-USD), the pioneer cryptocurrency, holds the longest track record in the digital asset space. Its substantial price and market capitalization set it apart from other crypto investments. With widespread acceptance as a payment method by numerous businesses, including major players like Visa (NYSE:V) and Stripe, Bitcoin proves to be a strategic investment. Even larger banks are integrating Bitcoin transactions into their services, solidifying their position in the financial landscape.However, in recent days, there has been a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, with the average fee surpassing $7, its highest point in almost two years, as reported by CoinDesk. Additionally, Binance temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice due to the unprecedented congestion on the Bitcoin network. Binance has since resumed its services.With increasing anticipation of unfavorable developments, Bitcoin emerges as a promising avenue. Notably, Bitcoin’s superior liquidity offers numerous advantages to investors. It facilitates the convenient conversion of gains into traditional currencies and provides ease of trading compared to smaller-cap alternatives in the market.Story continuesAvalanche (AVAX-USD)Avalanche (AVAX-USD) crypto coins on a black backgroundSource: Skorzewiak / ShutterstockAvalanche (AVAX-USD) is a recently developed blockchain known as a “layer one” solution, aimed at enhancing scalability. Created by Ava Labs and Cornell University computer scientists, including cryptography expert Emin Gün Sirer, it serves as a competitor to Ethereum (ETH-USD), as described by Binance.Avalanche’s unique feature is its ability to independently validate transactions across its three individual blockchains. This scalability allows Avalanche to process a high volume of transactions, reaching up to 6,500 per second. This scalability and its popularity among Ethereum projects have gained attention. Additionally, Avalanche’s coin has been chosen as Terra’s reserve currency, surpassing ether, as reported by Bloomberg. The Luna Foundation Guard, supporting Terra, planned to acquire $100 million worth of Avalanche as part of this initiative.Avalanche stands out with enhanced security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, while its subnets feature enables the creation of private or public blockchains within its network. With practical applications in various industries, Avalanche has the potential for value appreciation and growth. Although it faced a downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche has made a comeback in 2023 and has landed among the best cryptos to buy. It is an intriguing project for decentralized finance enthusiasts.Solana (SOL-USD)Solana Coin (SOL-USD) in front of the Solana logo. Solana price predictions.Source: Rcc_Btn / Shutterstock.comDespite facing a major crash and enduring challenges caused by the FTX fiasco, Solana (SOL-USD) has maintained a dedicated group of developers and users, ensuring its continued relevance. Although recovery may take time, the ecosystem shows potential for a promising future.The market slowdown in 2022 has impacted the entire space, causing a decline in old narratives like NFT mania and a scarcity of new alternatives. However, Solana has managed to stay on top of emerging trends in blockchain. One such trend is the rise of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), which are token wrappers representing staked assets like SOL. LSDs provide holders with the ability to access the value of their assets by selling or using them in DeFi, while still earning staking yields.Moreover, The Solana Saga, the platform’s unique Android flagship device, has recently been released, generating positive reviews for its quality and seamless integration with Web3 features. Despite past chain issues, development activity on Solana remains strong with promising prospects for the future. With the potential for the next blockchain killer app, Solana is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. The availability of LSDs and the new fee model further enhance the potential growth of SOL.Despite enduring a significant crash and facing difficult challenges, reports of Solana’s demise may be greatly overstated. The platform has maintained a dedicated community of developers and users, ensuring its continued relevance, albeit below previous levels. The future holds potential for the ecosystem, although it may require additional time for a full recovery.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in SOL-USD.

(NWSA) Have the Potential to Rally 39.43% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-news-corp-nwsa-potential-135511508.html,1685627711,STORY,"['TGT', 'NWSA']","[News Corp. (NWSA) closed the last trading session at $18.31, gaining 7.5% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $25.53 indicates a 39.4% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises four short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $3.66. While the lowest estimate of $21.10 indicates a 15.2% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 63.8% to reach $30. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NWSA. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NWSAThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 18%, as two estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, NWSA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NWSA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To address that increase in data usage and prepare for the continued influx expected throughout the summer months, Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Orlando, FL. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Orlando include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. 5G Ultra Wideband service is now available around Gotha, CasselBerry, along University Blvd and 417 in the Summer Woods area, University Blvd, Icon park, the Orlando Outlet Market, the South Orange area, Sea World, and Disney Blizzard Beach.Orlando’s 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Orlando will be able to take advantage of more than twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Orlando. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Orlando area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. Story continues“We know residents and visitors to Orlando count on us for reliable, secure, communication, and we are working hard to keep up with the significant increase in demand we are seeing in Orlando to ensure we deliver for them,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “The investments we’ve made in the recent past have made a big difference in the level of service customers in Orlando are receiving, and we are not slowing down with our upgrades in this market.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Orlando, FL customers have an outstanding experience on Verizon’s networkDespite the increases in demand on the network, the recent upgrades have led to customers having a solid experience on the Verizon network in Orlando, FL, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Orlando, Verizon is unbeaten in overall network performance, accessibility and call and text performance. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Orlando with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 13% since last year* in the market.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Orlando, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more.

Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China are impacting demand. Still-elevated raw material and logistics costs are also weighing on the margins of the companies in this space.Industry players like Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. APD, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. DD, Innospec Inc. IOSP and Koppers Holdings Inc. KOP are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and aggressive price hikes to tide over the challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building &amp; construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture. Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities, and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride), and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide). Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?Demand Worries From End-market Weakness: Companies in the chemical-diversified space are facing headwinds from a slowdown in certain key markets. The sluggishness in the building &amp; construction market and the destocking in consumer electronics are key concerns. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building &amp; construction. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes. Also, a slower recovery in economic activities in China following the lifting of the restrictions related to the resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting chemical demand in that country. The slowdown in Europe resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation has also led to softer demand in that region. The energy and feedstock inflation has resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. Weaker global economic activities have led to a higher level of near-term uncertainty, which may affect chemical volumes over the near term.Elevated Costs Pose Margin Headwinds: The industry players are exposed to cost pressure associated with raw materials resulting from short supply. These companies also face challenges arising from higher logistics costs. The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up the prices of inputs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and new government-mandated lockdowns in China have also put more pressure on the global supply chain. These companies are also facing headwinds from elevated energy costs in certain regions. The lingering impacts of these bottlenecks are expected to continue over the short term. Higher raw material, energy and logistics costs are, thus, likely to hurt the margins of diversified chemical companies.Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. These include the reduction of discretionary spending. The industry players are also raising selling prices to counter raw material and logistics cost inflation. These moves are likely to help the industry in sustaining margins amid the prevailing challenges.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

Robinson Worldwide CHRW is benefiting from a decrease in operating expenses and shareholder-friendly initiatives adopted by the company. Notably, shares of CHRW have gained 2.8% so far this year against the 1.2% loss of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company recently reported first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of 98 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 and declined 52.2% year over year due to unfavorable pricing in ocean and truckload services. Total revenues of $4611.7 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4780 million and declined 32.3% year over year.How is C.H. Robinson Doing?C.H. Robinson’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In November 2022, the company hiked its dividend to 61 cents per share from 55 cents. CHRW is also active on the buyback front. C.H. Robinson rewarded its shareholders in 2022 through a combination of cash dividends ($285.32 million) and share repurchases ($1,488.28 million). Continuing the shareholder-friendly approach, in the first quarter of 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $51.2 million and paid $73.4 million as cash dividends.A decrease in operating expenses aids C.H. Robinson’s bottom-line results. The metric fell 6.4% to $524.6 million during the March quarter. Personnel expenses decreased 7.3% to $383 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $141.5 million also declined 4%, mainly owing to decreased credit losses.On the flip side, C.H. Robinson's first-quarter 2023 total revenues decreased 32.3% to $4.6 billion, primarily due to lower pricing in ocean and truckload services. Also, quarterly earnings of 98 cents per share declined 52.2% year over year. The North American Surface Transportation segment’s total revenues were $3,304.18 million (down 19.7% year over year) in the March quarter. Segmental revenues were hurt by lower truckload pricing due to lackluster freight demand. Total revenues from Global Forwarding were $790 million, down 64% year over year. Results were negatively impacted by lower pricing in CHRW’s ocean and air services, reflecting softening freight demand.Story continuesThe company’s focus on making investments in technology, though aimed at long-term growth prospects, might weigh on C.H. Robinson’s bottom line in the near term. At the end of first-quarter 2023, capital expenditures rose 3% year over year. Capital expenditures for 2023 are anticipated to be between $90 million and $100 million.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, C.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.Copa Holdings, presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand.

Shares have lost about 8.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Cummins due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cummins Puts up a Stellar Q1 ShowCummins reported first-quarter 2023 earnings of $5.55 per share, which reflects an improvement from the prior-year quarter earnings of $4.04 per share. The reported figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.81. Higher-than-expected EBITDA in the Engine, Components, Distribution and Power Systems segments resulted in the outperformance. Cummins’ revenues totaled $8,453 million, up 32.3% from $6,385 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,022 million.Key TakeawaysIn the reported quarter, sales in the Engine segment were up 8% year over year to $2,986 million. The metric topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,933 million. The segment’s EBITDA increased to $457 million (accounting for 15.3% of sales) from $390 million (14.2% of sales) and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $441 million. On-highway revenues climbed 9%, driven by pricing actions and strong demand in the North American truck markets, strong aftermarket demand and smart pricing actions. Off-highway revenues rose 6.2%. Sales increased 9% in North America and 8% in international markets.Sales in the Distribution segment totaled $2,406 million, up 14% year over year and beat the consensus mark of $2,273 million. The segment’s EBITDA came in at $335 million (13.9% of sales), up from the previous year’s $110 million (5.2% of sales). Also, the metric surpassed the consensus mark of $209 million. Revenues from North America jumped 24%, while international sales plunged 5%. Higher revenues were driven by increased demand for parts and services and smart pricing actions.Story continuesSales in the Components segment were up 79% from the prior-year quarter to $3,557 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $3,237 million. Sales in North America were up 87%, while the same in international markets increased 69%, thanks to the Meritor buyout. The segment’s EBITDA was $507 million (14.3% of sales) compared with the year-ago figure of $320 million (16.1% of sales).

Long-term debt totaled $4,409 million, down from $4,498 million on Dec 31, 2022.2023 Outlook LiftedCummins now expects revenues to grow in the range of 15-20% year over year, up from the prior projection of 12. EBITDA is forecast to be in the range of 15-15.7% of sales, higher than the previous forecast of 14.5%-15.2%. Cummins continues to stick to its plan of returning nearly 50% of its operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Cummins has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Yahoo Finance media reporter Allie Canal breaks down the stock performance of several media companies and what to expect going into the summer.Video Transcript- It was a brutal month of May for media stocks from weaker earnings to a writers' strike that plagues the industry. But can investors expect any type of turnaround in June? Well, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now. Allie, what did we see during May, and how does that set up for June now?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, the big question is, will we see some reprieve in June? If we take a look at how many of these prominent companies, especially these streaming facing companies performed, we saw Paramount, Disney, Warner Brothers Discovery, double digit declines over the month falling roughly 32%, 14%, and 17% respectively. Then, Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, that fell 6%.And just to compare, the S&amp;P 500 was relatively flat over the month. So this was not good. The one bright spot here was Netflix. That was able to eke out a nearly 20% gain as it rolled out its password sharing crackdown, which is a key revenue driver across the US and beyond. We also saw some positive data surrounding its ad supported tier last month.But even Netflix, which has been the perceived leader in the streaming wars, it's going to battle a lot of noise moving forward, especially when it comes to potential churn, subscribers leaving the service due to that crackdown. And that's something that all of these companies are really facing right now. We've seen a ton of layoffs business restructurings in the name of profitability.Along with that, content spending has slowed with MoffettNathanson predicting a flattening in 2023, which we have seen across the board. Netflix has been one of the most notorious spenders in the streaming wars. But even they said their content spending is going to be flat year over year at around $17 billion. They are reportedly looking to cut costs in other areas with The Wall Street Journal saying that they are looking to overall spending by about $300 million.Story continuesStill, I do want to call out this one chart from FactSet, which shows that even though Netflix might be pulling back on spending a little bit, it's still one of the only services to offer just a ton of content. That is upcoming summer releases. We've seen Netflix at a whopping 45 new releases this summer. In second place is Disney at 21.So really, I don't think it's a total coincidence that Netflix has been the only streaming giant to really outperform for the month of May heading into the summer season due to that content spend. But really, a lot of risks overall for many of these media companies.- Yeah, and not just a streaming giant just outperforming in general, because you compare that to a legacy company like Paramount, which continues to struggle and has had to do some consolidation-- I mean, they got rid of MTV News.ALLIE CANAL: Yes.- I never thought I would see that happen. I mean, look at that share price now. I mean, sure it's up today but down from some serious highs that it saw once upon a time.Speaking of the larger landscape of media companies, we know they're still grappling with the writer's strike, and there is the potential for another strike, right? So there are certainly some headwinds. Is there any reason to be bullish about media companies?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, you're absolutely right. On the writers' strike, many of these leaders have said, look, we have enough content bank to weather the storm for now. But the longer it goes on, the more it could potentially impact the bottom line.That being said, I do think there are reasons to be bullish. But investors are going to have to be really patient. A big driver here is advertising. That's something that I think a lot of investors are really optimistic about, these ad-supported tiers driving profitability.I also think you're going to see a lot more bundling, which we've already seen in the market with Paramount Plus and Showtime, that combination, the HBO Max and Discovery Plus combo. And then, even Disney said it's going to be folding Hulu content into Disney Plus to eventually offer a one-app experience there. And that drives further customer value.So analysts have by and large said they believe all these initiatives, all these restructurings. Everything that they're doing right now is going to pay off but down the line. So I've seen a lot of analysts telling their clients to really stay on the sidelines for some of these companies right now until they reach that streaming profitability. But again, just a big TBD heading into the summer.- Right, exactly.- Have to keep tabs on there. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal.]"

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.ONEOK Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues MissONEOK Inc. reported first-quarter 2023 operating earnings per share (EPS) of $2.34, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 by 13.04%. The bottom line also improved 169% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 87 cents.The year-over-year improvement was due to higher natural gas liquid and natural gas volumes, higher average fee and natural gas storage rates.Total RevenuesOperating revenues for the quarter were $4,521 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,127 million by 11.8%. The top line also declined 16.9% from $5,445 million in the prior-year quarter.Highlights of the ReleaseAdjusted EBITDA came in at $1,717 million, up 98.7% year over year.Operating income totaled $1,497 million, up 126% from the prior-year quarter’s $662 million.ONEOK incurred interest expenses of $166 million, down 3.5% from $172 million recorded in the year-ago period.Financial HighlightsAs of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents worth $680 million compared with $220 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) was $12,728 million as of Mar 31, 2023, compared with $12,696 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended Mar 31, 2023 was $1,221 million compared with $463 million in the corresponding period of 2022.2023 GuidanceONEOK reaffirmed its EPS guidance in the range of $5.03-$5.69.

270,0ead74a6-6b42-3a6b-bde2-86e8c05f9d51,OKE,2023-06-02,Is ONEOK (OKE) a Suitable Stock for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-oke-suitable-stock-value-133500500.html,1685626500,STORY,"['OKE', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put ONEOK OKE stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, ONEOK has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.69, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 19.61. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, ONEOK’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint (which is 19.03)  over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Oils-Energy sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 5.86. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWe should also point out that ONEOK has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.35, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for ONEOK stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, ONEOK has a P/S ratio of about 1.19. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.64x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, ONEOK currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ONEOK a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though ONEOK might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A. This gives OKE a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 3.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 11%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:ONEOK, Inc. Price and ConsensusONEOK, Inc. Price and ConsensusONEOK, Inc. price-consensus-chart | ONEOK, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineONEOK is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 35% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline – MLB industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To explore similar stocks, you can go see 5 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default.""When The Market Throws a Sale, I Tell You To Do Some Buying""On May 12, Jim Cramer noted the bleak market conditions, with major indices such as the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 being down by 222 points and 0.17%, respectively. However, instead of throwing caution to the winds, the Mad Money host decided it was time to dive into a financial history lesson to show just where to put your money to turn a profit at a time when spending even a penny may hurt.Based on ""the economic data"" Cramer has analyzed, he found it safe to say that ""the Federal Reserve may finally be out of the picture."" He expressed that the situation may have even ""cooled enough"" for the Fed to ""not need to hit us with any more rate hikes any time soon."" News like this can only be a cause for celebration for any investor, but as Cramer shows in his episode, it does not mean it's time to forget about contingency planning for your stock portfolios. The economic crisis that the US is going through is very much real and very much present. Cramer noted that ""based on the last debt ceiling crisis, this market could have a lot more downside"" before the US government gets a deal if they get one at all. Here are some comments from Cramer on potential developments:“Maybe the government ends up defaulting on its obligations. That's very much on the table, despite protestations from both sides of the aisle that it will never happen. Right now with the economy slowing and tax receipts coming up short, we might bump up toward the limit by the end of the month.”It's not just the US that has been suffering from debt. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles, global debt, in general, is surging. In 2020 alone, global debt rose by 30% to 263% of gross domestic product. However, the US at present seems to be at a stalemate regarding the debt ceiling deadline. Cramer noted that:Story continues“On the one side, you have President Biden, who's been unwilling to negotiate in any substantive form. On the other side, you have Speaker McCarthy who's giving the appearance of being willing to negotiate, but his suggestions have very little chance of leading to any meaningful compromise.”""The White House Will Have To Blink""Despite the situation recounted above, Cramer is confident that the White House will have to bow, seeing as ""President Biden is running for re-election next year."" Because of his future plans, Biden cannot ""afford to let a default happen, or even a recession sparked by fears of default."" Regardless of how the situation plays out in the coming months, Cramer is more interested in recommending the best stocks to tide investors by in this time of uncertainty. So he uses the example of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis to learn from and navigate the current crisis.By considering this past economic crisis, Cramer takes his audience through the many stocks and sectors that managed to weather the storm back in 2011. They included a range of companies from pharmaceutical corporations and fast food providers to major tech names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have remained popular for decades. According to Cramer, ""What worked back then can perhaps work now.""10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt DefaultOur MethodologyTo pick our stocks, we first watched Jim Cramer's episode on Mad Money from May 12. Cramer talks about a number of stocks and sectors that initially dropped during the 2011 economic decline but managed to climb back up better than all other stocks on the market. From these stocks, we selected the top 10 by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest number to the highest.The companies Cramer covers in his episode were among the first to be impacted by the 2011 debt ceiling crisis. However, as Cramer shows, they were also among the best performers at that time and managed to claw their way back up on the charts as much as they could. Several factors, such as consumer reliance on the products and services offered by these companies or their immense potential to grow in light of technological advancements today, can make the same thing happen for these companies during the present crisis. The tech names we've mentioned above are part of this cohort of stocks, and they have immense potential to remain resilient and profitable for investors today because of their deep involvement in artificial intelligence, according to Cramer.10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default10. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Cramer feels that those who are looking for a food stock should consider Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), a stock that is ""crushing it with cookies."" He believes that apart from ""consistent demand"" for its products, the company is also benefitting from a ""decline in cost resulting from the end of supply-chain problems from COVID, and lower commodity prices,"" alongside ""cheaper transport.""GLG Partners was the largest shareholder in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) at the end of the first quarter, holding 2.9 million shares.On May 1, analysts at Mizuho raised the price target on Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) shares from $78 to $86. The firm also held its Buy rating on the stock.There were 51 hedge funds long the stock in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Deutsche Bank holds a Buy rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of May 1. The firm also raised its price target on the stock from $80 to $88.Cramer referred to Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as a ""sleeping giant"" that has awoken, one that ""seems poised for a nice run""As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds held stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). Their total stake value in the company was $3.2 billion.Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another stock that Cramer thinks can do well in the event of a debt default, in light of its past performance.8. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Of the 64 hedge funds long McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in the first quarter, Marshall Wace LLP was the most prominent stakeholder in the company, holding 1.6 million shares. The total stake value in the company was $4.04 billion.Alton Stump, an analyst at Loop Capital, holds a Buy rating and a $346 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares as of May 12.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) generated revenues of $5.9 billion, up by 4.1% year-over-year.Cramer thinks fast food stocks like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are definitely ""worth considering"" in times of economic crisis.7. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70On April 27, Barclays analysts raised the price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) from $201 to $206. The firm also reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Cramer believes that while The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has long been a stellar performer, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is ""the star of the show"" this time around. This development came in light of the company's monopoly on snack products, considering the fact that ""snacking has become far more ingrained in our lifestyle than it was in 2011.""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was noted among the portfolios of 70 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), has proven to be a resilient stock in times of economic crisis.6. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Cramer believes that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is ""on the cusp of the largest drug launch in ages."" The company's Mounjaro product, a ""revolutionary diabetes drug that doubles as a weight-loss treatment,"" may take its sales ""off the charts"" considering the obesity problem in the US.On May 26, Wells Fargo not only reiterated an Overweight rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares but also raised its price target on the stock from $440 to $500.Our hedge fund data shows 72 funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.GQG Partners held the most shares in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) at the end of the first quarter, coming in at 2.9 million shares.Fred Alger Management mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default. Suggested articles:Jim Cramer's Favorite Energy and Bank Stock PicksJim Cramer's Recession-Proof StocksJim Cramer's Comeback StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company said the vote tally would be reported in a regulatory filing. Last year, the company's executive pay package won support from just 27% of the shareholder votes cast.After last year's vote, Netflix said it made changes including instituting a salary cap for its co-chief executives and a performance-based bonus plan.This year, Executive Chairman Reed Hastings is set to receive a $500,000 salary and $2.5 million in stock. Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters will each collect an annual salary of $3 million. Sarandos stands to receive an additional $20 million in stock, and is eligible for a bonus of up to $17 million. Peters will collect $17.3 million in stock and a bonus of up to $14.3 million.Story continuesThe union has made executive compensation for Hollywood executives an issue in negotiation. Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel and Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav ranked in the top 10 of Equilar's 2022 study of the largest pay packages awarded to chief executives of publicly traded companies.The union has been applying pressure on media companies to coax them back to the bargaining table. Contract talks ended on May 1, after they reached an impasse over improved pay and residuals and changes in working conditions. The use of artificial intelligence is another stumbling block.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which is representing streamers like Netflix and the studios in negotiations, is currently in talks with the Directors Guild, whose current contract expires on June 30.

Founded in 2012, GAAD represents a moment for us all to reflect on the importance of creating equitable and inclusive experiences. We've made a lot of progress, which is inspiring, but there are always new technologies on the horizon, like AI for example, that make it exciting to think about future applications.At Comcast, accessibility isn't an afterthought. My team and I partner with teams across the company to deliver first-rate, accessible products and services. From day one, we have a seat at the table working closely with product teams to identify solutions to enhance the experience for the widest possible audience. In addition, we spend a lot of time talking with external audiences-through direct customer interactions and in partnership with leading disability organizations like the American Council of the Blind, the National Association of the Deaf, National Federation of the Blind, Team Gleason, United Spinal Association and many others-to get their feedback about how we can improve our products to be even more inclusive for people with a variety of disabilities.As a consumer with a disability myself, I can always tell when I'm using a product that has taken accessibility to heart. It shows when a company has brought individuals with different types of disabilities into the product design conversation early as well as throughout the entire development lifecycle. I'm proud to say that for more than a decade at Comcast this approach has been fundamental to our product innovations.Most recently, we followed this method with our Large Button Voice Remote, which was launched last fall. Since then, it has been lauded by USA Today and FastCompany for its inclusive design. During the development process, we worked with our Experience Design research team in senior centers, independent living facilities and at disability-focused technology and consumer conferences where we could talk directly with people who offered us a wide range of perspectives and feedback.Story continuesLast week, I revisited one of those locations, New Horizons, near Hartford, Connecticut, which houses seniors and adults with physical disabilities. I had the opportunity to thank them for their input and participation in helping us build such an innovative device.The Large Button Voice Remote builds on our many years of other product innovations. These include our Xfinity Web Remote app, which won TIME Magazine's ""Best New Invention"" in 2019, and enables customers to independently control Xfinity X1 and Flex using their preferred assistive technologies. We also have our "" Talking Guide"" that reads the menu of our X1 TV menu as you move through the screens. All these options are important because we know accessibility isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for everyone.So, on Global Accessibility Awareness Day we reflect on all that we've been able to accomplish so far, but we're also thinking creatively about what other new solutions are just around the corner. Comcast is proud to join with other organizations to raise awareness and inspire others to have conversations about creating a more inclusive world.Tom Wlodkowski is Vice President of Accessibility at Comcast.Comcast Corporation, Thursday, June 1, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758693/Recognizing-Global-Accessibility-Awareness-Day-and-Beyond]"

Discovery stocks experience rough May",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/disney-paramount-warner-bros-discovery-153040564.html,1685633440,VIDEO,"['PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'WBD', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'CMCSA']","[Amid earnings reports and the ongoing writers' strike, media stocks struggled in the month of May. Yahoo Finance media reporter Allie Canal breaks down the stock performance of several media companies and what to expect going into the summer.Video Transcript- It was a brutal month of May for media stocks from weaker earnings to a writers' strike that plagues the industry. But can investors expect any type of turnaround in June? Well, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now. Allie, what did we see during May, and how does that set up for June now?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, the big question is, will we see some reprieve in June? If we take a look at how many of these prominent companies, especially these streaming facing companies performed, we saw Paramount, Disney, Warner Brothers Discovery, double digit declines over the month falling roughly 32%, 14%, and 17% respectively. Then, Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, that fell 6%.And just to compare, the S&amp;P 500 was relatively flat over the month. So this was not good. The one bright spot here was Netflix. That was able to eke out a nearly 20% gain as it rolled out its password sharing crackdown, which is a key revenue driver across the US and beyond. We also saw some positive data surrounding its ad supported tier last month.But even Netflix, which has been the perceived leader in the streaming wars, it's going to battle a lot of noise moving forward, especially when it comes to potential churn, subscribers leaving the service due to that crackdown. And that's something that all of these companies are really facing right now. We've seen a ton of layoffs business restructurings in the name of profitability.Along with that, content spending has slowed with MoffettNathanson predicting a flattening in 2023, which we have seen across the board. Netflix has been one of the most notorious spenders in the streaming wars. But even they said their content spending is going to be flat year over year at around $17 billion. They are reportedly looking to cut costs in other areas with The Wall Street Journal saying that they are looking to overall spending by about $300 million.Story continuesStill, I do want to call out this one chart from FactSet, which shows that even though Netflix might be pulling back on spending a little bit, it's still one of the only services to offer just a ton of content. That is upcoming summer releases. We've seen Netflix at a whopping 45 new releases this summer. In second place is Disney at 21.So really, I don't think it's a total coincidence that Netflix has been the only streaming giant to really outperform for the month of May heading into the summer season due to that content spend. But really, a lot of risks overall for many of these media companies.- Yeah, and not just a streaming giant just outperforming in general, because you compare that to a legacy company like Paramount, which continues to struggle and has had to do some consolidation-- I mean, they got rid of MTV News.ALLIE CANAL: Yes.- I never thought I would see that happen. I mean, look at that share price now. I mean, sure it's up today but down from some serious highs that it saw once upon a time.Speaking of the larger landscape of media companies, we know they're still grappling with the writer's strike, and there is the potential for another strike, right? So there are certainly some headwinds. Is there any reason to be bullish about media companies?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, you're absolutely right. On the writers' strike, many of these leaders have said, look, we have enough content bank to weather the storm for now. But the longer it goes on, the more it could potentially impact the bottom line.That being said, I do think there are reasons to be bullish. But investors are going to have to be really patient. A big driver here is advertising. That's something that I think a lot of investors are really optimistic about, these ad-supported tiers driving profitability.I also think you're going to see a lot more bundling, which we've already seen in the market with Paramount Plus and Showtime, that combination, the HBO Max and Discovery Plus combo. And then, even Disney said it's going to be folding Hulu content into Disney Plus to eventually offer a one-app experience there. And that drives further customer value.So analysts have by and large said they believe all these initiatives, all these restructurings. Everything that they're doing right now is going to pay off but down the line. So I've seen a lot of analysts telling their clients to really stay on the sidelines for some of these companies right now until they reach that streaming profitability. But again, just a big TBD heading into the summer.- Right, exactly.- Have to keep tabs on there. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal.]"
277,8d26af36-e352-3702-9959-c225f53dbaad,CMCSA,2023-06-02,Investors Heavily Search Comcast Corporation (CMCSA): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-comcast-corporation-130007159.html,1685624407,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Comcast (CMCSA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this cable provider have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. The Zacks Cable Television industry, to which Comcast belongs, has lost 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Comcast is expected to post earnings of $1 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 points to a change of +3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.12 indicates a change of +9.7% from what Comcast is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Comcast is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMCSA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Comcast, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $120.67 billion and $123.52 billion estimates indicate -0.6% and +2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryComcast reported revenues of $29.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +15%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Comcast is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Comcast. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Prudential due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Prudential Financial Q1 Earnings Miss on Higher ExpensesPrudential Financial, Inc. reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted operating income of $2.66 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9% and our estimate of operating income of $3.07. The bottom line declined 16.1% year over year.Total revenues of $15,104 million increased 10.5% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.7%. The rise in revenues was due to higher premiums, asset management fees, commissions and other income and net investment income. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12,905.3 million.Prudential Financial's first-quarter results were affected by declining operating income year over year for all of its segments and rising expenses. Improving premiums and net investment income partially offset the negatives.Operational UpdateTotal benefits and expenses amounted to $13,838 million, which rose 18% year over year in the first quarter. This increase was due to higher insurance and annuity benefits, interest credited to policyholders' account balances, interest expenses and general and administrative expenses. The figure was higher than our estimate of $11,442.2 million.Quarterly Segment UpdatePrudential Global Investment Management’s (PGIM) adjusted operating income of $151 million declined 19.7% year over year. The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.5% and our estimate of $180.4 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees due to a reduction in assets under management in the quarter. The negatives were partially offset by higher other-related revenues.PGIM assets under management of $1.3 trillion in the reported quarter fell 10% year over year due to higher interest rates, net outflows and declining equity markets.The U.S. Businesses delivered an adjusted operating income of $760 million, which decreased 6.5% year over year. The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.6% and our estimate of $955.9 million. The downside was due to lower net investment spread results because of lower variable investment income and lower net fee income. It was partially offset by more favorable underwriting results.International Businesses’ adjusted operating income decreased 11.7% year over year to $840 million in the first quarter. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.8% and our estimate of $743.4 million. This decrease primarily reflects lower net investment spread results due to lower variable investment income and less favorable underwriting results.Corporate and Other incurred an adjusted operating loss of $485 million, wider than $416 million reported a year ago. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.9% and our estimate of a loss of $416.6 million. This higher loss reflects higher expenses, partially offset by higher net investment income.Story continuesCapital DeploymentPrudential Financial managed to return capital to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases worth $250 million and dividends worth $468 million in the first quarter.Financial UpdatePRU exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $17,425 million, which increased from $14,086 million at 2022-end.

283,c2d7fd35-dfbc-3017-8840-d043e279a415,MU,2023-06-02,Bear of the Day: Micron (MU),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-micron-mu-102000885.html,1685701200,STORY,"['MU', 'NVDA']","[Micron Technology (MU) became a Zacks #5 Rank this spring as EPS estimates collapsed for the current fiscal year, which ends in August, from a loss of $2.28 to a loss of $4.71.That earnings drawdown would represent a 156% annual decline for the ""megalodon of memory"" if it unfolds as projected.What many investors don't realize is how integral Micron memory innovations are to the AI revolution across multiple platforms including mobile, autos, medicine, robotics and the datacenter.Besides the traditional volatility of commoditized memory chips and supply chain constraints, which delivered a 189% EPS miss for the February quarter, Micron has been dealing with higher pressure from China.Sales restrictions on Micron's products in China can be seen as a retaliatory action by the red state against the U.S. government's increasing restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology.Here's an excerpt from our May 22 reporting...Micron Faces Restrictions for Selling Products in ChinaMicron has been imposed with a trade restriction by the Cyberspace Administration of China on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. In a statement, China’s cybersecurity regulator revealed that the U.S.-based memory chipmaker has failed to pass a cybersecurity review, which it had initiated in late March 2023.The development can be seen as a retaliatory action by the Chinese government against the U.S. government’s increasing restrictions on Chinese access to critical and more advanced semiconductor technology.In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for artificial intelligence, data analytics and computing applications. Over the past few months, the Netherlands and Japan also joined the United States to restrict China from making advanced chips.The tit-for-tat actions could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.In late March, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.The memory chip maker has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, Micron announced that it would shut down DRAM design operations at its Shanghai facility by the end of the year. The move was seen as a strategic shift from the manufacturing of chips back to the United States amid mounting trade tensions between the United States and China.But MU is not the only semiconductor company that has been impacted by the tech war between the world’s two largest economies.On Aug 31, 2022, NVIDIA (NVDA) disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia. The government also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.The new licensing requirements will also be implied for any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will fall under export restrictions.Bottom line: MU appears a strong value near $65 as it trades under 4X forward sales projections of $20 billion. We just need to see how this cycle plays out with new pressure from China. The Zacks Rank will let you know.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +12% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -126.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of -$4.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -156.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.03 indicates a change of +99.4% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $3.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -57.3%. The $15.45 billion and $21.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -49.8% and +36.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $3.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -52.6%. EPS of -$1.91 for the same period compares with $2.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.24%. The EPS surprise was -189.39%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Decline in retail sales of toys is a concern for the industry. Nevertheless, robust performance of smart toys, STEM toys (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), sports toys and fashion dolls and accessories bodes well. The industry participants have been undertaking efforts on the digital front and focusing on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives to drive growth. The industry players, including Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. TTWO and Hasbro, Inc. HAS are likely to gain from the aforementioned trends.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Toys - Games – Hobbies industry comprises companies that design, manufacture and sell various games and toys. While traditional toymakers primarily focus on marketing and selling action figures, accessories, dolls, youth electronics and arts and crafts, other industry players develop and market content and services on video game consoles, personal computers and mobile. Some industry participants offer video game platforms, playing cards, Karuta and other products along with handheld and home console hardware systems and related software. A few companies also develop and operate retail and online military simulation games and provide multiplayer and single-player games.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Zacks Toys - Games ??? Hobbies IndustryHigh Costs Remain Concerns: Cost inflation had a negative impact on the industry due to a rise in raw materials prices. Temporary store closures in some parts of the world, product shortages, lower retail inventories and supply chain disruption have been denting the industry’s performance. Higher employee-related expenses are also hurting the industry. The companies have been resorting to product launches and shifting toward more technology-driven toys to boost sales, which might drive profits in the long haul. However, costs related to the initiatives may prove detrimental to the industry in the near term.Dismal Toys Retail Sales: Toy sales declined in 2022. Per NPD Group, U.S. retail sales of toys declined 0.2% in 2022. Unit sales declined by 4%, whereas average selling price came in at $12.68, up 3% year over year. Toy industry growth contributed to a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10%, aided by average selling price and unit sales growth of 5% and 2%, respectively. The industry performance in 2022 was hurt by inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, weather distributions and concern regarding new COVID variant threat.STEM Toys Gaining Popularity: Amid declining sales of traditional toys, the robust demand for STEM toys has come as a breather.

290,62d8534c-b9f6-3ca4-aa18-76b8b2f4668b,MCD,2023-06-02,20 Poorest Countries in Europe,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-poorest-countries-europe-115506985.html,1685706906,STORY,"['MCD', 'PEP']","[In this article, we discuss the 20 poorest countries in Europe. If you want to see the top poorest countries in this region, check out 5 Poorest Countries in Europe.As per Eurostat’s findings, approximately 21.7% of the population in the European Union (EU), amounting to about 95.4 million people, faced the risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2021. The findings showed that women, young adults, individuals with limited educational qualifications, and, more specifically, unemployed people were at a greater risk of poverty or social exclusion. In the European Union, although the probability of employed people facing poverty or social exclusion stood at 11.1%, and that of retired persons was 18.6%, for unemployed and other idle individuals, the risk of poverty or social exclusion stood at 64.5% and 42.3%, respectively. Among the nations within the EU, Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece exhibited the highest percentages of individuals identified as facing the risk of poverty. Eurostat reported that families with dependent children were more likely to face the threat of poverty or social exclusion at 22.5%, compared to families without dependents at 20.9%.According to Euronews, compared to the general population, there is a greater risk of young Europeans falling victim to poverty. In 2021, data indicated that 20% of individuals in the age group of 15 to 29 faced a risk of poverty. Moreover, the overall at-risk-of-poverty rate for the entire population of the EU was recorded at 17%. In terms of the disparity between at-risk young individuals and the general population, Denmark exhibited the most significant divide, with 25.6% of young people facing risks compared to 12.3% of the overall population. Sweden followed closely behind Denmark, with a margin of nearly nine percentage points. Eurostat explained this indicator in the following words:“It doesn't necessarily imply a low standard of living, and measures the share of people that have disposable income below the poverty threshold.”Story continuesA World Economic Forum report noted that approximately 7% of the population in the European Union faced difficulties in maintaining adequate heating in their homes during the year 2021. This was because Europe faced an energy shortage which resulted in an increase in heating bills. Fuel poverty had the most impact on Bulgaria, with Lithuania and Cyprus closely trailing behind. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, one in three individuals faced the risk of encountering energy poverty during the winter season.Moreover, Save the Children reported that in 2021, the European Union nations saw an increase of over 200,000 in the number of children on the verge of poverty, pushing the overall number of children likely to face poverty to more than 19.6 million. Factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, high cost of living, and the climate crisis caused the number of families and children facing poverty to escalate at an unnerving pace. According to the AROPE (At Risk of Poverty and/or Exclusion) indicator, Spain and Romania emerged as the nations with the most elevated proportions, 33.4% and 41.5% respectively, of children at risk of experiencing poverty or social exclusion. During 2022, Romania witnessed a remarkable surge of 98% in expenses. However, 40% of households faced a decline in income, compelling them to adopt substantial cost-cutting measures. The report highlighted that the most vulnerable children in this situation were asylum-seekers, those with migrant backgrounds, and undocumented children.Ylva Sperling, Save the Children Europe Director, stated:“No child should have to go to school on an empty stomach, worry about their parent’s job or live in a household that’s cold. Yet, the impact of Europe’s many crises makes eating or heating no longer a choice for many families and deprives children of the essentials they need for their development and well-being.”According to the European Central Bank, the Russia-Ukraine war devastated the worldwide economy. The conflict affected the food and energy markets in particular, causing a decrease in supply and an unusual increase in prices. The EU has been particularly vulnerable to the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compared to other regions. The United Nations’ “World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023” report estimated the huge losses endured by the economy of Ukraine, noting that the country’s economy experienced a decrease of over 30% in 2022.In October 2022, the New York Times observed that after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, various global companies, like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) were left facing the difficulty of unraveling complex agreements in Russia. These companies had established relationships with the country over several decades, making the situation particularly complex. Upon being pressurized by consumers and investors, multiple Western companies decided to fully exit Russia. Adidas, for example, decided to discontinue sales in the country, despite having nearly 500 stores in Russia and the previous Soviet states. This also contributed to the issue of poverty in Europe and may have long-term implications as well. In this article, we discuss the poorest European nations.Poorest Countries in EuropePhoto by Ev on Unsplash Our MethodologyTo identify the poorest countries in Europe, we examined data from Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Databook 2022, specifically focusing on the GDP per Adult in 2021. GDP per adult helps identify countries with lower average income levels, indicating that individuals in those countries may have limited financial resources. We selected the 20 poorest countries in Europe based on this metric, ranking the list in descending order of GDP per adult. It is important to acknowledge that some of these countries may appear relatively prosperous because Europe is generally a wealthy continent.Nevertheless, poverty encompasses a wide range of factors, including the availability of essential needs such as food, clean water, healthcare, education, housing, and social services. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of poverty in a country, it is vital to consider multiple indicators and measures. These aspects cannot be fully captured by GDP per capita alone.Poorest Countries in Europe20.

He expressed that the situation may have even ""cooled enough"" for the Fed to ""not need to hit us with any more rate hikes any time soon."" News like this can only be a cause for celebration for any investor, but as Cramer shows in his episode, it does not mean it's time to forget about contingency planning for your stock portfolios. The economic crisis that the US is going through is very much real and very much present. Cramer noted that ""based on the last debt ceiling crisis, this market could have a lot more downside"" before the US government gets a deal if they get one at all. Here are some comments from Cramer on potential developments:“Maybe the government ends up defaulting on its obligations. That's very much on the table, despite protestations from both sides of the aisle that it will never happen. Right now with the economy slowing and tax receipts coming up short, we might bump up toward the limit by the end of the month.”It's not just the US that has been suffering from debt. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles, global debt, in general, is surging. In 2020 alone, global debt rose by 30% to 263% of gross domestic product. However, the US at present seems to be at a stalemate regarding the debt ceiling deadline. Cramer noted that:Story continues“On the one side, you have President Biden, who's been unwilling to negotiate in any substantive form. On the other side, you have Speaker McCarthy who's giving the appearance of being willing to negotiate, but his suggestions have very little chance of leading to any meaningful compromise.”""The White House Will Have To Blink""Despite the situation recounted above, Cramer is confident that the White House will have to bow, seeing as ""President Biden is running for re-election next year."" Because of his future plans, Biden cannot ""afford to let a default happen, or even a recession sparked by fears of default."" Regardless of how the situation plays out in the coming months, Cramer is more interested in recommending the best stocks to tide investors by in this time of uncertainty. So he uses the example of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis to learn from and navigate the current crisis.By considering this past economic crisis, Cramer takes his audience through the many stocks and sectors that managed to weather the storm back in 2011. They included a range of companies from pharmaceutical corporations and fast food providers to major tech names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have remained popular for decades. According to Cramer, ""What worked back then can perhaps work now.""10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt DefaultOur MethodologyTo pick our stocks, we first watched Jim Cramer's episode on Mad Money from May 12. Cramer talks about a number of stocks and sectors that initially dropped during the 2011 economic decline but managed to climb back up better than all other stocks on the market. From these stocks, we selected the top 10 by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest number to the highest.The companies Cramer covers in his episode were among the first to be impacted by the 2011 debt ceiling crisis. However, as Cramer shows, they were also among the best performers at that time and managed to claw their way back up on the charts as much as they could. Several factors, such as consumer reliance on the products and services offered by these companies or their immense potential to grow in light of technological advancements today, can make the same thing happen for these companies during the present crisis. The tech names we've mentioned above are part of this cohort of stocks, and they have immense potential to remain resilient and profitable for investors today because of their deep involvement in artificial intelligence, according to Cramer.10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default10. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Cramer feels that those who are looking for a food stock should consider Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), a stock that is ""crushing it with cookies."" He believes that apart from ""consistent demand"" for its products, the company is also benefitting from a ""decline in cost resulting from the end of supply-chain problems from COVID, and lower commodity prices,"" alongside ""cheaper transport.""GLG Partners was the largest shareholder in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) at the end of the first quarter, holding 2.9 million shares.On May 1, analysts at Mizuho raised the price target on Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) shares from $78 to $86. The firm also held its Buy rating on the stock.There were 51 hedge funds long the stock in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Deutsche Bank holds a Buy rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of May 1. The firm also raised its price target on the stock from $80 to $88.Cramer referred to Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as a ""sleeping giant"" that has awoken, one that ""seems poised for a nice run""As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds held stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). Their total stake value in the company was $3.2 billion.Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another stock that Cramer thinks can do well in the event of a debt default, in light of its past performance.8. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Of the 64 hedge funds long McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in the first quarter, Marshall Wace LLP was the most prominent stakeholder in the company, holding 1.6 million shares. The total stake value in the company was $4.04 billion.Alton Stump, an analyst at Loop Capital, holds a Buy rating and a $346 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares as of May 12.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) generated revenues of $5.9 billion, up by 4.1% year-over-year.Cramer thinks fast food stocks like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are definitely ""worth considering"" in times of economic crisis.7. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70On April 27, Barclays analysts raised the price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) from $201 to $206. The firm also reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Cramer believes that while The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has long been a stellar performer, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is ""the star of the show"" this time around. This development came in light of the company's monopoly on snack products, considering the fact that ""snacking has become far more ingrained in our lifestyle than it was in 2011.""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was noted among the portfolios of 70 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), has proven to be a resilient stock in times of economic crisis.6. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Cramer believes that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is ""on the cusp of the largest drug launch in ages."" The company's Mounjaro product, a ""revolutionary diabetes drug that doubles as a weight-loss treatment,"" may take its sales ""off the charts"" considering the obesity problem in the US.On May 26, Wells Fargo not only reiterated an Overweight rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares but also raised its price target on the stock from $440 to $500.Our hedge fund data shows 72 funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.GQG Partners held the most shares in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) at the end of the first quarter, coming in at 2.9 million shares.Fred Alger Management mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default. Suggested articles:Jim Cramer's Favorite Energy and Bank Stock PicksJim Cramer's Recession-Proof StocksJim Cramer's Comeback StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
293,53fd202b-33cd-3bff-8eb9-d8d72b0221c2,MCD,2023-06-02,Is McDonald's (MCD) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-mcd-buy-wall-street-133006692.html,1685626206,STORY,['MCD'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about McDonald's (MCD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying McDonald's, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MCD a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $11.03.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company currently has an approximately 2,000 MW development portfolio across Kentucky, several projects under advanced development, and continues to develop meaningful partnerships to grow its investment across the Commonwealth.BrightNight Logo (PRNewsfoto/BrightNight)One of BrightNight's most recent agreements is with Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company (LG&amp;E and KU) for a long-term 115-megawatt power purchase agreement (PPA). This PPA adds to a growing list of recent agreements signed between BrightNight and its customers, as the company accelerates its portfolio buildout. The power from this PPA will be generated by BrightNight's renewable power project to be located in Ballard County, KY, with a targeted 2026 commissioning. The power from the facility will be added to LG&amp;E and KU's generation fleet to help meet their customers' energy demands and to provide customers with safe, reliable power at a reasonable cost.Building on a Strong Customer and Community PartnershipThis PPA is the second signed agreement between BrightNight and LG&amp;E and KU. The two parties signed a PPA for 125 MW in 2021.""We deeply value our customer relationship with LG&amp;E and KU, and this second project demonstrates our commitment to building strong, long-term partnerships,"" BrightNight CEO Martin Hermann said. ""LG&amp;E and KU are clear leaders in developing multiple sources of energy.

""We executed this second PPA with BrightNight because they not only develop innovative renewable projects, but they also listen to what our needs are and deliver innovative solutions,"" Sinclair said. The PPA was referenced in LG&amp;E and KU's current Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity filing submitted to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in December.The BrightNight project is located in western Kentucky and has reached several development milestones. BrightNight is exploring agrivoltaic solutions for the project, which is the blending of agriculture and photovoltaic energy generation. These project solutions support local agricultural business in parallel with its energy production.""We appreciate Ballard County's leadership on the integration of renewable power into their community,"" Hermann added. ""Being a good neighbor is a critical part of our work in bringing these projects to communities across Kentucky. Ballard County has been a collaborative partner helping shape the project that will meet our customer's needs and the community's preferences.""In a letter to the Kentucky State Board on Electric Generation and Transmission Siting, the Ballard Industrial Development Authority wrote, ""We look forward to the success of these projects and the benefits they will provide and we [Ballard County] wish to become a leader for renewable energy in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.""BrightNight's Growing Kentucky PresenceWith the current portfolio across Kentucky and projects in development, the estimated total statewide investment impact from BrightNight construction of this portfolio is estimated at over $400 million dollars and will generate significant tax revenues for the state and localities.

To explore similar stocks, you can go see 5 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default.""When The Market Throws a Sale, I Tell You To Do Some Buying""On May 12, Jim Cramer noted the bleak market conditions, with major indices such as the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 being down by 222 points and 0.17%, respectively. However, instead of throwing caution to the winds, the Mad Money host decided it was time to dive into a financial history lesson to show just where to put your money to turn a profit at a time when spending even a penny may hurt.Based on ""the economic data"" Cramer has analyzed, he found it safe to say that ""the Federal Reserve may finally be out of the picture."" He expressed that the situation may have even ""cooled enough"" for the Fed to ""not need to hit us with any more rate hikes any time soon."" News like this can only be a cause for celebration for any investor, but as Cramer shows in his episode, it does not mean it's time to forget about contingency planning for your stock portfolios. The economic crisis that the US is going through is very much real and very much present. Cramer noted that ""based on the last debt ceiling crisis, this market could have a lot more downside"" before the US government gets a deal if they get one at all. Here are some comments from Cramer on potential developments:“Maybe the government ends up defaulting on its obligations. That's very much on the table, despite protestations from both sides of the aisle that it will never happen. Right now with the economy slowing and tax receipts coming up short, we might bump up toward the limit by the end of the month.”It's not just the US that has been suffering from debt. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles, global debt, in general, is surging. In 2020 alone, global debt rose by 30% to 263% of gross domestic product. However, the US at present seems to be at a stalemate regarding the debt ceiling deadline. Cramer noted that:Story continues“On the one side, you have President Biden, who's been unwilling to negotiate in any substantive form. On the other side, you have Speaker McCarthy who's giving the appearance of being willing to negotiate, but his suggestions have very little chance of leading to any meaningful compromise.”""The White House Will Have To Blink""Despite the situation recounted above, Cramer is confident that the White House will have to bow, seeing as ""President Biden is running for re-election next year."" Because of his future plans, Biden cannot ""afford to let a default happen, or even a recession sparked by fears of default."" Regardless of how the situation plays out in the coming months, Cramer is more interested in recommending the best stocks to tide investors by in this time of uncertainty. So he uses the example of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis to learn from and navigate the current crisis.By considering this past economic crisis, Cramer takes his audience through the many stocks and sectors that managed to weather the storm back in 2011. They included a range of companies from pharmaceutical corporations and fast food providers to major tech names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have remained popular for decades. According to Cramer, ""What worked back then can perhaps work now.""10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt DefaultOur MethodologyTo pick our stocks, we first watched Jim Cramer's episode on Mad Money from May 12. Cramer talks about a number of stocks and sectors that initially dropped during the 2011 economic decline but managed to climb back up better than all other stocks on the market. From these stocks, we selected the top 10 by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest number to the highest.The companies Cramer covers in his episode were among the first to be impacted by the 2011 debt ceiling crisis. However, as Cramer shows, they were also among the best performers at that time and managed to claw their way back up on the charts as much as they could. Several factors, such as consumer reliance on the products and services offered by these companies or their immense potential to grow in light of technological advancements today, can make the same thing happen for these companies during the present crisis. The tech names we've mentioned above are part of this cohort of stocks, and they have immense potential to remain resilient and profitable for investors today because of their deep involvement in artificial intelligence, according to Cramer.10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default10. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Cramer feels that those who are looking for a food stock should consider Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), a stock that is ""crushing it with cookies."" He believes that apart from ""consistent demand"" for its products, the company is also benefitting from a ""decline in cost resulting from the end of supply-chain problems from COVID, and lower commodity prices,"" alongside ""cheaper transport.""GLG Partners was the largest shareholder in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) at the end of the first quarter, holding 2.9 million shares.On May 1, analysts at Mizuho raised the price target on Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) shares from $78 to $86. The firm also held its Buy rating on the stock.There were 51 hedge funds long the stock in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Deutsche Bank holds a Buy rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of May 1. The firm also raised its price target on the stock from $80 to $88.Cramer referred to Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as a ""sleeping giant"" that has awoken, one that ""seems poised for a nice run""As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds held stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). Their total stake value in the company was $3.2 billion.Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another stock that Cramer thinks can do well in the event of a debt default, in light of its past performance.8. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Of the 64 hedge funds long McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in the first quarter, Marshall Wace LLP was the most prominent stakeholder in the company, holding 1.6 million shares. The total stake value in the company was $4.04 billion.Alton Stump, an analyst at Loop Capital, holds a Buy rating and a $346 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares as of May 12.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) generated revenues of $5.9 billion, up by 4.1% year-over-year.Cramer thinks fast food stocks like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are definitely ""worth considering"" in times of economic crisis.7. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70On April 27, Barclays analysts raised the price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) from $201 to $206. The firm also reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Cramer believes that while The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has long been a stellar performer, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is ""the star of the show"" this time around. This development came in light of the company's monopoly on snack products, considering the fact that ""snacking has become far more ingrained in our lifestyle than it was in 2011.""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was noted among the portfolios of 70 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), has proven to be a resilient stock in times of economic crisis.6. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Cramer believes that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is ""on the cusp of the largest drug launch in ages."" The company's Mounjaro product, a ""revolutionary diabetes drug that doubles as a weight-loss treatment,"" may take its sales ""off the charts"" considering the obesity problem in the US.On May 26, Wells Fargo not only reiterated an Overweight rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares but also raised its price target on the stock from $440 to $500.Our hedge fund data shows 72 funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.GQG Partners held the most shares in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) at the end of the first quarter, coming in at 2.9 million shares.Fred Alger Management mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023.

After being the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 two years in a row, they are now the worst performing sector this year. Crude and natural gas prices have sunk from last year’s highs after the Ukraine War spooked the market. Traders have abandoned the stocks again for the better performing semiconductors and AI stocks.  But with Wall Street ignoring energy, the stocks are again cheap.  But are they true values or traps?  Difference Between a Value and a Trap Remember, there is a difference between value stocks and those that are value traps. The key is to look at earnings. Are the earnings expected to rise year-over-year? If so, then there might be a true value there. Investors are getting rising earnings on sale. A trap is when the earnings are on the decline.  5 Energy Stocks: Values or Traps? SLB SLBSLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is a global oil services company. The services business is not as tied to the daily price movements of oil and natural gas.  SLB shares have sunk in 2023, falling 19.3%. It’s gotten cheaper. SLB trades with a forward P/E of 14.7. It also has a PEG of 0.5. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates a company is both a value and has growth.  Is SLB a value or a trap?  NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. NEXNexTier Oilfield Solutions is a small cap services company, with a market cap of $1.8 billion.  Shares of NexTier Oilfield Solutions have sunk in 2023. It’s down 14.2% year-to-date. And now it’s dirt cheap. NexTier Oilfield Solutions has a forward P/E of just 2.8. Story continues How much cheaper can NexTier Oilfield Services get?  EOG Resources, Inc. EOGEOG Resources is one of the big independent oil and natural gas producers. Shares of EOG Resources are down 15.4% year-to-date but are not yet at the 2023 lows that were hit in March.  Still, EOG Resources is cheap with a forward P/E of 9 and a PEG ratio of just 0.3. It has both value and growth. Analysts have had a tough time with earnings estimates this year as crude and natural gas prices have dropped. 4 estimates are up and 7 have been cut in the last 30 days.  Is EOG Resources a value or a trap? Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXYOccidental Petroleum is a large cap oil and natural gas producer who also is a big chemical producer. It’s been in the public eye the last few years as Berkshire Hathaway has taken a large position in the company. In 2023, Warren Buffett continued to add to his position.  Shares of Occidental Petroleum have fallen 6.4% year-to-date but are up off the 2023 lows. Occidental Petroleum is cheap. It has a forward P/E of 11.4 and a PEG ratio of 0.5. Analysts are bearish on 2023, with 8 earnings estimates cut and only 1 estimate raised in the last 30 days.  Is Buffett getting it right on Occidental Petroleum?  Exxon Mobil Corp. XOMExxon Mobil is a big, integrated oil company with exploration and production, refining, distribution, service stations and chemicals. Exxon Mobil is one of the largest operators in Guyana.  Shares of Exxon Mobil are down 5.4% in 2023. Still, the shares are cheap with a forward P/E of 10.9 and a PEG ratio of 0.6. Exxon Mobil also pays a dividend, yielding 3.5%. Analysts are bearish, however, with just 1 estimate revised higher in the last 30 days, and 5 estimates revised lower.  Is Exxon Mobil a value or a trap?  Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On a year-over-year basis, the top line improved 4.2%.The fiscal first quarter top line was driven by Veeva Systems’ robust segmental performances.Segmental DetailsVeeva Systems derives revenues from two operating segments — Subscription services; and Professional services and other.In the fiscal first quarter, Subscription services revenues improved 2.9% from the year-ago quarter to $414.5 million. Our projection for fiscal first-quarter revenues was $405 million.Professional services and other revenues were up 9.1% year over year to $111.8 million, primarily resulting from continued strength in Research and Development (R&amp;D) Solutions services and Veeva Business Consulting.Our projection for fiscal first-quarter revenues was $110.1 million.Veeva Systems Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $577.7 million.Subscription revenues are estimated to be approximately $465 million in the fiscal second quarter.Adjusted EPS is projected to be between $1.12 and $1.13.

The uptick in the overall top line and robust performances by both segments during the quarter are impressive. The company continues to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions, with new SMB customer additions and expansions in Veeva Commercial Cloud, looks promising.Veeva Systems registered great traction in newer areas, including Veeva Vault Safety, Veeva Link, and Veeva Compass, which augurs well. The continued progress in clinical data management with Enterprise and CRO opportunities raises our optimism.On the flip side, decline in adjusted EPS in the reported quarter is disappointing. Rising operating costs putting pressure on the margins during the quarter were another concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVeeva Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Hologic, Inc.

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 3.3% compared with 18.8% decline of the industry and a 0.4% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $8.49 billion. The company projects 14.6% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other, the average surprise being 17.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q1 Results: DaVita’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both segments during the period. DaVita also recorded an increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Mar 31, 2023, the company had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.Story continuesAs of Mar 31, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 were U.S. centers while 351 were located across 11 other countries. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of three new dialysis centers in the United States. It also opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 11.5% north to $6.69.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion, suggesting a 0.6% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $200 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure critical long lead material and associated efforts to support maintenance of the full rate production timeline for the congressionally added F/A-18E/F aircraft.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in El Segundo, CA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.46%.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 7.2% improvement from the previous year’s reported figure.Price Movement and Zacks RankShares of Boeing have risen 48.1% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 3.3% compared with 18.8% decline of the industry and a 0.4% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $8.49 billion. The company projects 14.6% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other, the average surprise being 17.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q1 Results: DaVita’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both segments during the period. DaVita also recorded an increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Mar 31, 2023, the company had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.Story continuesAs of Mar 31, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 were U.S. centers while 351 were located across 11 other countries. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of three new dialysis centers in the United States. It also opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 11.5% north to $6.69.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion, suggesting a 0.6% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

A joint development agreement is expected to be signed later this year.This new eFurnace technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for the olefins cracking process in the future, significantly reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of its olefins production process, and helping the company meet its ambitious climate targets.""We are taking decisive steps to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, while creating solutions for everyday sustainable living,"" said Peter Vanacker, CEO of LyondellBasell. ""Deployment of an industrial-scale electric cracking furnace is one option we are considering in this space because of its ability to reduce furnace GHG emissions by up to 90% compared to a conventional furnace.""Construction of the demonstration unit, which would be the first for LyondellBasell, is an essential step in the development of eFurnace technology and a critical pre-condition for potential future construction of a full-scale unit.

More than ever, we are putting sustainability at the heart of how we can create more value moving forward. That's more value for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and society. We have increased our level of ambition and reoriented the company around achieving ambitious goals with the new structures we have put in place. We realize these changes create an opportunity to be ahead of the curve, gain early mover advantage in the market and help shape the future rather than react to it. Q: How is LyondellBasell aligning its core business strategy with its sustainability strategy? A: We used to talk about our sustainability strategy and our corporate strategy as two separate items. However, now we have pulled the sustainability strategy into our core business strategy as one of the key pillars. We believe this move will help drive value for the company moving forward. This means sustainability is now ‘built-in' and not a ‘bolt-on', which is a significant shift for our company. In tangible terms, this means everybody in the company has a role to play in helping to achieve our overall sustainability goals and deliver value for our company.Q: What do you think are the biggest achievements for sustainability at LyondellBasell over the last year?A: We have made significant progress in creating the best structures for success. We have set up a new strategic business unit focused on accelerated delivery of circular and low carbon solutions, with Yvonne van der Laan as executive vice president. This structural change will help us be more agile and focused on delivering value from our portfolio of sustainable solutions. We also have a new unit within our business, dedicated to delivering the reductions we need to meet our 2030 and net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions targets. In December of 2022, we accelerated our GHG emissions reduction targets and established a scope 3 target, which is aligned with the best available science. We have signed the Letter of Commitment to the Science-Based Targets initiative, and are seeking validation of our 2030 goals. It's a significant and forward-leaning step for LyondellBasell and one that we believe puts us at the forefront of our industry.Story continuesWe are also now in our second year of tying our short-term compensation incentives to our ESG performance metrics, of which 20% is safety performance and 10% is progress aligned to our sustainability efforts including our GHG reduction goals and our goal to produce and market at least 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030.In short, we have put in place the necessary structures to lead and deliver. Outside of the company, these changes are not always visible, but the actions are important to our future success in delivering value from sustainability to our stakeholders.Q: How are you accelerating the circular economy?A: As a leading polymer producer, we want to make sure we are keeping valuable materials in use for as long as possible and fostering a circular economy. We want to ensure plastics continue to enable greater sustainability across so many challenges - from helping to avoid food waste to being essential components in the energy transition. We are finding new opportunities to access waste feedstocks, developing new partnerships to expand mechanical recycling and developing game-changing advanced recycling technology that will take hard-to-recycle plastic waste and turn it into feedstock for new polymer materials. Together, these activities will drive value and address the growing demand we see in the market for circular and low carbon solutions.Q: From your perspective as Chief Sustainability Officer, how does LyondellBasell view its role and responsibility to create a more sustainable world?A: As a large global company producing materials millions of people around the world use in everyday living, we have an important role to play. The polymers we produce are used in applications such as food packaging and vital medical supplies, and in applications that enable the energy transition such as wind turbines, solar panels, and lightweight parts that improve vehicle efficiency. We view our role as a fundamental solution provider who can unlock possibilities today and for future generations.View the full LyondellBasell 2022 Sustainability Report.For information about the factors that could impact our forward-looking statements, please see page two of the LyondellBasell Sustainability Report.LyondellBasell, Thursday, June 1, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from LyondellBasell on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LyondellBasellWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/lyondellbasellEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: LyondellBasellView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758613/LyondellBasell-2022-Sustainability-Report-Interview-With-Our-Chief-Sustainability-Officer-Andrea-Brown]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.99% gain on the day.Prior to today's trading, shares of the insurer had lost 7.6% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's loss of 3.22% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.42% in that time.Cincinnati Financial will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.91, up 40% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $2.05 billion, up 3.73% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.64 per share and revenue of $8.38 billion. These totals would mark changes of +9.43% and +4.45%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cincinnati Financial. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.53% higher within the past month. Cincinnati Financial is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Cincinnati Financial currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 20.8. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.7, so we one might conclude that Cincinnati Financial is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, CINF's PEG ratio is currently 1.2.

327,1da40beb-fb13-3ed1-8158-e920b09b743c,GE,2023-06-02,Brokers Suggest Investing in GE (GE): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-ge-ge-133005287.html,1685626205,STORY,['GE'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Electric (GE).GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying GE, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is GE Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.03.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, to which GE belongs, has lost 1.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.GE is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -42.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.03 points to a change of -22.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +96.8% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GE is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For GE, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -19.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.19 billion and $67.6 billion estimates indicate -18.8% and +8.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.69%. The EPS surprise was +107.69%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.In the midst of uncertain economic conditions globally, the healthcare sector has displayed a notable degree of resilience. Historically, the demand for healthcare products and services has proven to be relatively inelastic. The healthcare sector’s strength was evident during the equity downturn experienced in 2022 as well, where the sector outperformed broader equity markets. According to BlackRock, healthcare stocks demonstrated 23% less volatility compared to the overall market during the last year. In the past seven recessions, the healthcare sector has consistently surpassed broad market performance by an average margin of 10%. Furthermore, over the span of the last six recessions, earnings within the industry have experienced an average growth of 21%. Some of the best healthcare stocks in the industry include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Like many other industries, the healthcare sector underwent significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report released by Deloitte, approximately 70% of the global population received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.  As the global economy returns to the new normal and the COVID-19 pandemic moves towards the endemic stage, the healthcare sector is adapting to new trends to shape its future outlook. One notable shift in the industry is the increasing virtualization of care, which has not only transformed the way healthcare services are delivered but has also attracted new players in the industry. For instance, in 2021, the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser Permanente jointly invested $110 million into Medically Home Group, a venture company focused on hospital-at-home services.Story continuesIndustry's Growth TrajectoryThe delivery of healthcare services is no longer restricted to healthcare companies only, but leading technology and retail companies are now making a play at it as well. In November 2021, leading electronics retailer Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) invested $400 million to acquire the care-at-home platform Current Health. Meanwhile, technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also partnered with Zimmer Biomet to develop remote sensors that could be installed in smartphones and smartwatches and used to track the recovery of patients following their knee replacement surgery. As per Deloitte, the remote monitoring devices segment is expected to gain more mainstream attention as its size is forecasted to increase from $30 billion in 2021 to $101 billion in 2028. This reflects an annual average growth rate of 18.9%.The overall demand for the healthcare sector can be gauged by the fact that one in three adults across the world has chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as of 2023. Meanwhile, one in every four individuals is expected to experience a form of mental illness during their life. According to Deloitte, over a period of 20 years, the world is expected to face an economic loss of $16.3 trillion due to mental illnesses. However, despite the rising demand for healthcare services, the sector’s ability to deliver remains constrained due to numerous factors. Around $935 billion, or 25% of the US healthcare expenditure, is wasted due to administrative red tape or inefficiencies, pricing irregularity, and labour shortages. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a shortage of 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals by 2035. Experts think an active adoption of technology and virtual delivery systems can help overcome such a significant shortage of healthcare professionals in the near future.15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe initially compiled an extensive list of companies actively involved in the healthcare sector. Next, we used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 to identify the stocks that attracted the highest number of hedge fund investors during the quarter.

(NASDAQ:SRPT) by over 90% during Q1 2023.14. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60On May 16, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was upgraded from a Market Perform to an Outperform rating, and the target price was revised from $90 to $100 by Evan Seigerman at BMO Capital. The analyst highlighted that the Foster City, California-based biopharmaceutical company has the “best-in-class” cell therapy portfolio that is backed by a stellar manufacturing ability. Furthermore, the company is also focused on improving its solid tumour oncology division by bringing Trodelvy into its portfolio by getting the drug’s commercialization rights in the Asian market from Everest Medicines.Here's what Ariel Investments said about Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD. advanced in the quarter on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, creating greater visibility into the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”13. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a Nashville, Tennessee-based healthcare services company founded in 1968. The company operates a vast network of hospitals, outpatient centres, and other healthcare facilities across the US and UK. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is expanding its presence in Texas as it announced the acquisition of 41 urgent care centres from FastMed earlier this month. Presently, the company has 92 urgent care centres along with 45 hospitals and 395 physician practices present in the Lone Star State. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) has made an investment outlay of $6.6 billion in the last six years in the state. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 0.86% as of May 29.Renaissance Investment Management shared its stance on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Lastly, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) was another contributor. The company is seeing solid improvements in surgical volumes and overall healthcare usage. Meanwhile, labor expenses, which have weighed heavily on operating margins, appear to be reversing as extra headcount brought on to accommodate spikes in patient volumes due to COVID is finally subsiding.”12. DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a San Diego, California-based medical device company founded in 1999 that specializes in the development and manufacturing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Matthew Blackman at Stifel increased the price target on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) from $130 to $140 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock in an investment note issued on April 28. The analyst shared that the company’s Q1 2023 results checked “all the important boxes,” in his opinion.Baron Funds shared its outlook on DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”11. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67On May 18, Richard Newitter at Truist raised the price target on Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) from $325 to $347 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. In April 2023, the stock price of the Sunnyvale, California-based robotic surgical system producer recorded the highest increase in three years following the release of the company’s Q1 2023 results. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) saw its revenue increase by 13.4% YoY to $1.69 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast of $1.68 billion. Meanwhile, the adjusted EPS was posted at $1.23 and was three cents higher than analysts' forecast.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG): ISRG shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite 4Q results largely in line with expectations. The company used the quarterly release to define the timeline of upcoming products including its next-gen platform, now expected next year. The market was disappointed by this timing.Intuitive is the pioneer and clear leader in robotic surgery and remains one of our most compelling long-term growth opportunities. The company’s products address a massive market with very low current penetration, and the company has a strong moat. Its major competitors, J&amp;J and Medtronic, are facing large delays (to at least 2024) in introducing their platforms as the FDA approval process has become more difficult. These delays give Intuitive more time to place systems, train surgeons and launch new products, extending its competitive advantage. The company’s “Extended Use Program” aims to make its tools more price-competitive to traditional non-robotic procedures, which increases the company’s moat.”10. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) secured tenth position on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy now. On May 11, an analyst at Argus raised the price target on Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) from $320 to $350 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst noted that the acceptance of a supplemental biologics license application by the FDA for Leqembi for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s could be a growth catalyst for Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock. Furthermore, the review of Lecanemab in China, Europe, and Japan and, subsequently, its approval in these markets could provide further impetus to the growth outlook of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB).9. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is a Louisville, Kentucky-based provider of health insurance products and services to individuals, employers, and government-sponsored programs.

(NYSE:HUM) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 0.68% as of May 29.8.

Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations, and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”6. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73On May 18, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) received encouraging news as an independent panel of experts at the US FDA recommended the approval of Abrysvo, a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE).

Shares have lost about 3.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Welltower due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Welltower Q1 FFO Tops, SHO Occupancy Up, ’23 View RaisedWelltower’s first-quarter 2023 normalized FFO per share of 85 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents. The reported figure improved 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s actual.Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues. The total SSNOI increased year over year, driven by SSNOI growth in the SHO portfolio. The company also raised its guidance for 2023 FFO per share.Welltower clocked in revenues of $1.56 billion in the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 billion. The top line increased 11.8% year over year.Quarter in DetailThe SHO portfolio’s same-store revenues increased almost 10% year over year to $965.2 million, backed by a 240 bps uptick in average occupancy from the year-ago quarter. A 6.8% year-over-year rise in same-store revenue per occupied room was another contributing factor.In the first quarter, property operating expenses flared up 12.2% to $957.8 million year over year.The company’s total portfolio SSNOI grew 11% year over year, supported by SSNOI growth in its SHO portfolio of 23.4%.WELL’s pro-rata gross investments in the first quarter totaled $785 million. This included $529 million in acquisitions and loan funding, and $257 million in development funding. It opened four development projects for a pro-rata investment amount of $57 million. Welltower also completed pro-rata property dispositions and loan payoffs of $92 million in the quarter.Story continuesPortfolio ActivityIn the quarter, WELL sold a 15% interest in 31 skilled nursing assets to Integra Healthcare Properties for $74 million as part of the earlier announced transition and sale of 147 skilled nursing facilities, originally operated by ProMedica, to Integra. This represented the second tranche of the 85/15 joint venture between Welltower and Integra. The remaining tranches are expected to close later this year.The company acquired care homes in Northern Ireland, to be operated by Healthcare Ireland under a new triple-net master lease, for $75 million.WELL also purchased 29 MOBs across multiple transactions for $348 million. The buyout of the MOBs, encompassing 1.3 million rentable square feet, represented an initial yield of 6.9%. This was inclusive of the acquisition of a 174,000 square feet MOB strategically located in Washington, DC, which has 82% occupancy currently and an initial yield of 6.6%.Balance Sheet PositionAs of Mar 31, 2023, WELL had $4.6 billion of near-term available liquidity comprising $0.6 billion of available cash and restricted cash and full capacity under its $4.0 billion line of credit.2023 Guidance RaisedWelltower now projects 2023 normalized FFO per share of $3.39-$3.54, up from the prior-guided range of $3.35-$3.53.The company’s full-year guidance now assumes the average blended SSNOI growth of 9-13%, comprising 17-24% growth in Seniors Housing Operating, 1-3% in Seniors Housing Triple-net, 2-3% in Outpatient Medical and 3-4% in Long-Term/Post-Acute Care.Welltower expects to fund an additional $649 million of development in 2023 relating to projects underway as of Mar 31, 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Welltower has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A.

337,dcefbc5b-4f1b-3f9f-9842-771a8eafa464,DHI,2023-06-02,"‘House Prices Are Set to Plunge,’ According to Elon Musk, but Deutsche Bank Smells Opportunity in These Homebuilder Stocks",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/house-prices-set-plunge-according-171653560.html,1685639813,STORY,"['DBK.DE', 'DHI', 'PHM', 'MTH']","[The housing market has long been one of the major supports of the US economy. More than a decade of low interest rates made mortgages more affordable, in both the residential and commercial markets, and real estate properties were considered solid investments. But is that changing?The real estate landscape is definitely shifting and has been for the past year. The Federal Reserve’s tighter monetary policy and significantly higher interest rates – all in the service of tackling inflation – are increasing mortgage costs, making homes less affordable.In the eyes of Elon Musk, this represents a real problem on the horizon, which he has described as the “most serious looming issue.”“The massive jump in monthly payments for a 30-year mortgage, due to significantly higher interest rates, obviously greatly reduces home affordability. Mortgage portfolios are at risk if housing prices drop significantly,” Musk added.On the other hand, taking a controversial stance, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer has become decisively bullish on new residential construction.“Optimism was palpable in January around new resi, and this has been largely substantiated by company outlooks and homebuilder results and commentary through the first five months of the year,” Ahlersmeyer explained.Against this backdrop, Ahlersmeyer has been pointing out homebuilder stocks that investors should consider now. Here are the details on three of his top picks.DR Horton (DHI)The first Deutsche Bank pick is DR Horton, the Texas-based construction firm that leads the pack in the US homebuilding sector. By business volume, DHI is the nation’s largest homebuilder, and has held that position for over 20 years now. The company operates in 33 states and 110 residential markets, and builds multi-family apartment complexes as well as single-family homes.In the single-family home market, DHI operates in every income bracket, building smaller, low-end homes priced near $150,000 and working up to mansions for $1 million or more. DR Horton has subsidiaries to back up its core homebuilding business; these companies provide vital homebuyer services such as mortgage financing, title services, and home insurance.Story continuesA look at DR Horton has to start with the share performance. DHI stock has outperformed the broader markets in the past year, and by a wide margin. It’s up some 42% in the past year, compared to just 2% on the S&amp;P 500. Narrowing the focus just to 2023, when the S&amp;P has posted better gains, DHI is still ahead, with a 17% year-to-date gain compared to 10% on the S&amp;P index.This share performance has been backed up by solid financial results. The last reported quarter, the fiscal 2023 second quarter, showed a top line of $8 billion in total revenue. While flat year-over-year, this result beat the analyst forecasts by $1.49 billion. The company’s income was just as strong. DHI reported an EPS figure of $2.73 per diluted share, 82 cents ahead of expectations.These results were based on 19,664 home sale closures during the quarter, for home sale revenues, the core of the company’s business, of $7.4 billion.Looking ahead, DHI has net sales orders for 23,142 homes, to an order value of $8.6 billion. The company has bumped up its fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance into the $31.5 billion to $33 billion range – where analysts had been expected guidance of about $28.5 billion.In his coverage of DHI, Deutsche Bank’s Ahlersmeyer paints an upbeat picture of the firm’s future: “Several years from now, we see DHI with a greater number of Top 3 market positions in the fifty largest markets, possessing higher share in each of those markets as well as higher overall national share, and we also expect stronger volume growth than any other builder under our coverage…. We also see upside to valuation as the company continues to outperform peers in the marketplace and demonstrate sustainably higher returns on inventory and equity.”Ahlersmeyer goes on to rate DHI shares as a Buy, with a $150 price target that suggests a gain of ~39% in the next 12 months. (To watch Ahlersmeyer’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street rates this stock as a Moderate Buy. DHI has 14 recent analyst reviews, with a breakdown of 8 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The current trading price of $108.08 and the average price target of $123.81 combine to give a 14.5% one-year upside potential. (See DHI stock forecast)Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH)The second stock on our list, Meritage, shows that it’s not just the very top US homebuilders who are succeeding in today’s market. Meritage is the fifth largest of the country’s home construction companies, with a significantly smaller market share than DHI above. But, Meritage has still seen its shares grow more than 35% in the past year, and 23% this year along.The company has built this success through 37 years of operations in 9 states. Meritage is known as a leader in building energy-efficient homes, and to date has built some 165,000 houses. In 2021, the company saw total revenues of $5.14 billion; that number grew to $6.29 billion in 2022.A look at the company’s recent 1Q23 results, released at the end of April, shows that Meritage is doing better than the analysts predicted. The firm’s top line revenue figure, of $1.28 billion, slipped one percent y/y but was $245 million ahead of the estimates. The bottom line EPS, of $3.54 per share, was down 39% from the previous year but was 90 cents better than the forecast.On two important positive notes, Meritage reported that the 2,897 home closings it had in Q1, and the nearly $1.3 billion in quarterly home closing revenue, represented company records for a first quarter.In the eyes of Deutsche Bank’s Ahlersmeyer this company deserves a second look from investors. The analyst writes: “We expect Meritage to continue to execute well on its strategy to nearly exclusive build spec-built entry-level homes, and we believe that greater scale and standardization will continue to lead to better margins as well as quicker sales turnover in each community. This should lead to higher returns on inventory, which we believe could settle out in the range of 15%+.”These comments back up Ahlersmeyer’s Buy rating, while his $200 price target implies a robust 70% gain on the one-year time horizon.Overall, MTH has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 4 Buys and 3 Holds set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $117.80, and at $211 the average price target suggests a 79% upside potential. (See MTH stock forecast)PulteGroup (PHM)Wrapping up, we’ll take a look at PulteGroup. This firm, founded in 1950, has since become America’s #3 homebuilder, and can rake in more than $16 billion in annual revenue. PulteGroup has an active presence in over 40 major metropolitan areas, and its assets include ownership of important brand names like Centex, American West, and, of course, Pulte. The company has built more than 800,000 homes in its lifetime.Over its long history, PulteGroup has built a reputation for bringing returns to investors – a trend that has continued in the past year. The company’s 12-month share appreciation is more than 49%, and the shares are up 43% for 2023. PulteGroup has shown consistent year-over-year revenue gains for the past year, despite headwinds in the real estate sector. PulteGroup last year invested some $17 billion into land acquisition – an important point of positioning for a home construction firm.PulteGroup’s current position is solid. The company’s 1Q23 revenues grew 14% year-over-year, to reach $3.58 billion, and came in $310 million ahead of expectations. On earnings, PulteGroup reported $2.35 in non-GAAP EPS, a figure that was 53 cents better than the forecast. Those numbers were backed up by a 6% y/y increase in quarterly home closings, to 6,394. The company saw a 9% increase in the average home price, to $545,000.Looking ahead, PulteGroup has a ‘unit backlog’ of 13,129 homes, valued at approximately $8 billion.Given all of the above, Deutsche Bank’s Joe Ahlersmeyer has high hopes. Along with a Buy rating, he gives PHM a $95 price target, which puts the upside potential at 42%.Backing his stance, Ahlersmeyer writes: “PHM can pull the right growth and returns levers to drive higher TBV/sh, as land investments in recent years underpin the outlook for growth in communities and greater spec sales will drive higher absorptions…. We envision PHM sustaining higher margins, driven once again by efficiency gains and only modestly offset by further mix headwinds from entry level product. PHM should exhibit a smooth transition as strong profitability in backlog flows through while the company puts a floor under returns with increases in specs.”Overall, PulteGroup gets a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 recent reviews that include 9 Buys against 3 Holds. The shares have a current selling price of $66.75, and the average price target of $78.67 implies ~18% increase from that level.

The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks.

It also is a big piece of American's strategy to compete in the New York market, where it was losing money.Since the partnership started, American has ceded domestic capacity out of New York to JetBlue. It has allowed American to move away from unprofitable routes while maintaining a presence in New York. The alliance also enables the airline to feed traffic to its global partners who fly into the region.If the alliance is dissolved, it will likely be forced to rebuild its capacity or cut international flights out of the region.When asked about options Wednesday at an investor conference, CEO Robert Isom declined to share details, saying ""there's a lot to be worked out.""The company has called the ruling ""wrongly decided"" and plans to appeal, but its executives don't see a material impact to the company's earnings as the court's order is not expected to have ramifications beyond New York.American has not specified the JetBlue alliance's contribution to its earnings. But in its ruling, the court said JetBlue owed American a transfer payment upwards of $200 million at the end of 2021 as part of the deal's revenue-sharing agreement.Before the JetBlue court ruling, Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja, who is steering American's strategy shift, told Reuters that the company is focused on markets where it can create ""outsized value"" for customers and will rely on partner airlines where it can't.Story continuesAmerican has been leaning on JetBlue in the Northeast region and Alaska Airlines on the West Coast. In long-haul international markets, American has been relying on partners like Qatar Airways.These alliances allow American to sell tickets on its partner flights and generate revenue at a fraction of the cost of operating flights itself.It is also seeking to gain market share in Sunbelt states such as Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Arizona and North Carolina, where population and commerce are growing.Passenger traffic to the Sunbelt states rebounded at the fastest clip after the pandemic. Bookings for trips to the region continue to outpace those for overall domestic travel, led by demand for flights to Dallas, Houston, Austin, Charlotte and Phoenix, data from Airlines Reporting Corporation shows.""We're putting the flights where the demand is,"" said Raja. ""The other thing that makes us different versus our competitors is the degree to which we are leveraging our partners.""The company has yet to spell out a plan in case it is forced to unwind the JetBlue alliance. It did not make Raja available for a follow-up interview.DOOMED ALLIANCE?James Speta, a Northwestern University law professor, said American's alliance with JetBlue in its current structure is ""more likely than not"" doomed. But with ""significant"" changes, it can try to address antitrust concerns by making it look more like its partnership with Alaska.""My speculation would be that JetBlue and American would very much consider revising the Northeast Alliance,"" said Speta.American's current playbook is a shift from pre-pandemic, when Raja said the airline tried to be ""all things to all people"" and operated in markets where it didn't have a lot of strength.With a restructured network, American has said it wants to generate revenue in excess of its market share.It also expects short-haul markets to provide greater visibility on travel demand, allowing it to adjust faster to consumer behavior changes.Its bet on consumer markets makes sense because corporate travel has been slow to recover, said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at Ingalls &amp; Snyder.American has said the long-haul business is the most volatile and capital-intensive part of airline business. But it expects short-haul markets to provide a steady revenue stream.Last year, company revenue surpassed pre-pandemic level even as capacity remained below, leading to its first full-year profit in three years. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect a more than five-fold increase in 2023 profit.""It is a smart strategy,"" Ghriskey said. He doesn't expect the court ruling to result in any immediate change in the company's overall network strategy.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh, editing by Ben Klayman and Anna Driver)]"

This increase is attributed to lower jet fuel costs and strong travel demand. Despite concerns about a potential recession, travel during the Memorial Day weekend exceeded pre-COVID levels for the first time, indicating sustained resilience in the industry.Take a Detailed Look Into the American Airlines’ ForecastAs per an article on CNBC, American Airlines provided an updated estimate on Wednesday, stating that their adjusted per-share earnings for the quarter are projected to range between $1.45 and $1.65. This represents an increase from their previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.40 per share.Additionally, the airline anticipates unit revenues for the three-month period ending Jun 30 to be 1% to 3% lower compared to the same period last year, which is a better outcome than their earlier projection of a potential 4% decline.The airline company anticipates that the average fuel price per gallon, inclusive of taxes, will range from approximately $2.55 to $2.65 for the second quarter. This represents a decrease from their earlier estimate of around $2.65 to $2.75.We may take cues from American Airlines’ forecast. And it may so happen that other airlines may also follow suit in the coming days to realize the tailwind from falling energy prices.Encouraging Consumer NumbersMemorial Day air travel demonstrated resilience in consumer spending on trips, surpassing pre-Covid levels despite ongoing inflation concerns. Per CNBC, the Transportation Security Administration reported screening 9.79 million individuals from Friday to Monday, a slight increase compared to the 2019 holiday weekend. Setting a post-pandemic record, over 2.7 million people were screened on Friday alone.Airlines for America research indicates that U.S. airlines are projected to transport a record-breaking 257 million passengers from Jun 1 to Aug 31, 2023, showcasing an unprecedented level of air traffic, as stated in AviationSource News.Story continuesAgainst this backdrop, below, we highlight the pure-play airlines ETF, U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS.ETF in FocusU.S. Global Jets ETF seeks to closely track the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index, providing exposure to airline companies across the globe with an emphasis on domestic passenger airlines.

""Expressing my creativity and getting outside of myself to do something with more purpose-for me, it's a no-brainer,"" VanHouweling says.For VanHouweling, the event, organized by the Principal® Foundation, quickly morphed into something bigger. She made a kit-then two puppets for her grandchildren. She shared notes about the group with her daughter; maybe a local youth support group could plug into FYBS. And VanHouweling, a senior change management consultant, wondered how FYSB might work with volunteer efforts for other agencies in her community. ""Just being in a room with people I don't know and possibly making some new friends along the way is inspiring,"" she says. ""It's a great mental health opportunity.""Employers like Principal have increasingly realized that supporting mental health through volunteer events like FYBS, employee resource groups (ERGs), or employee assistance programs (EAPs) improves not just the workplace, but work overall.Volunteering: Offering a connection to mental healthVanHouweling connected what research has already proven: Volunteering does give a boost to mental health. It improves happiness and confidence1 and leads to a flood of feel-good endorphins.2Providing access to those volunteer opportunities at work is even more important at this moment. More people than ever are struggling with their mental well-being at home and at work.For example, 24% of U.S. adults say their mental health is either fair or poor; women, younger adults, and those with lower annual household incomes suffer in greater numbers.3 Nearly two out of five adults-39%-say work negatively impacts their mental health, reporting mental health concerns, performance issues, and stress.4Story continuesStruggles with mental well-being don't stop once you get to work; if you are suffering, you may have reduced focus, insomnia, and decreased teamwork.5 Workplaces that ignore mental health supports may also face increased attrition, particularly with younger generations.6""Similar to physical illness, when mental health suffers it is difficult to deliver peak performance at work,"" says Mackenzie Sheehan, senior associate, Principal Foundation and community relations. ""Mental health struggles can impact focus and steal joy from work we love.""ERGs: Finding supportive communitiesBoth Jennifer Schwartz and Anna Mundy have children with severe medical challenges. Schwartz's son has muscular dystrophy, and Mundy's son was born with spina bifida. For their families, it's not just about caregiving and adaptations; there are also mental and emotional hills to climb-again and again. Having a workplace that supports their total well-being and provides employee resource groups, or ERGs, to share resources and stories helps.""My leaders and my department both conveyed that I needed to take care of myself,"" says Mundy; she's legal counsel with Principal. ""I didn't feel like my ability to come back to work was in jeopardy."" For Mundy, sharing her experience is a way of supporting her well-being-and others, too: ""I've learned things going through what I've gone through, and so I can offer that to people, but I can learn from them, too.""Schwartz agrees; she and Mundy co-chair the Principal OneAbility ERG, dedicated to creating a place of belonging for all abilities. ""I was able to open up about my vulnerability, and I may not have been able to do that at other companies,"" Schwartz says; she's a human resources business partner at Principal. ""I feel like I can be a balanced parent and a balanced person.""Common mental health support in an EAP may include:Counseling for anxiety and depressionCrisis interventionGrief supportSupport for behavioral health issues such as eating disorders or addictionResearch backs up the importance of ERGs to mental health and belonging. Because of their very nature-building community and connection-ERGs help employees feel authentic at work and find purpose.7 Belonging at work can translate directly to performance, reducing turnover, increasing job performance, and decreasing sick days.8EAPs: Providing outside expertiseAs much as mental health affects the workplace, it also affects financial security. If you're more stressed, you're more likely to suffer financial worries, and vice versa.9At work, benefits such as employee assistance programs can help-but they too often carry a stigma. ""People don't know about them, don't know where to start, and don't know the full range of what they offer,"" says Shelley Garrington, a director at Principal.The pandemic only accelerated both the employee desire for support like those offered in EAPs, and employers' focus on mental well-being. Seven in ten workers believe their employer is now more concerned about mental health than in the past.10 But only about half of employees that have access to an EAP are even aware of the benefit.11Mundy was able to turn to an EAP during a past traumatic family event; it helped. ""You often don't know who to start with or where to start, and it's an avenue to open doors,"" she says.The awareness of and willingness to access EAPs may be changing-for both employers and employees. Retaining talent means meeting the human side of employees, says Mundy, and willingness to talk about EAPs helps destigmatize them, Schwartz has noticed.""I had a team member that talked about going to a counselor-she considered that professional part of her care team, and a proactive way to strengthen her health,"" Schwartz says. ""I was always so proud of her, especially for making the conversation common. The more we do that, the more people can find out how to get the help they need."" 1NAMI 2Cleveland Clinic 3Gallup 4APA 2022 Work and Well-being Survey 5Cost of Workplace Mental Health 6Harvard Business Review 7McKinsey 8Deloitte 9National Library of Medicine 10APA 2022 Work and Well-being Survey 11HR Executive This article is intended to be educational in nature and is not intended to be taken as a recommendation.About Principal® FoundationPrincipal Financial Group Foundation, Inc.

The sale of these systems, which serve approximately 3,000 customer connections combined, follows the approval of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and is the first in the state of New Jersey to be completed through the Water Infrastructure Protection Act (WIPA).This press release features multimedia.

From left: Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water and Lisa Jiampetti, Mayor of Egg Harbor City (Photo: Business Wire)The state’s WIPA legislation was signed into law in 2015. It permits the sale or lease of municipally owned water or wastewater systems that meet certain criteria. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection certified the city’s request to pursue the sale through the WIPA path in April 2019.""This is a historic moment for New Jersey communities that simply do not have the resources or capabilities to adequately or efficiently maintain their own water and wastewater systems,"" said New Jersey Assembly Majority Leader and WIPA sponsor Louis D. Greenwald. ""When my fellow legislators and I passed WIPA, our goal was to help struggling municipalities find alternatives to meet their needs by providing capital investment, expertise and financial assistance. It is incredibly gratifying to see Egg Harbor City be able to take advantage of this program to get the system upgrades they need in order to better service the community.""Story continuesUnder the agreement, New Jersey American Water will invest $14 million in the first 10 years to make needed upgrades to the city’s water and wastewater systems, including $9 million in the first five years, while keeping rates stable for customers. Some of these projects include construction of an emergency interconnection with the New Jersey American Water regional system for resiliency, water and sewer main replacements, valve and hydrant replacements and wastewater pump station improvements.""This agreement provides tremendous benefits for our residents. The sale of our city’s water and wastewater systems to New Jersey American Water will provide nearly $22 million to help the city pay off existing debt while leaving additional money to assist in other areas of the city’s budget. Additionally, the company is committed to investing $14 million into much-needed system improvements. All told, this means better infrastructure, stable water rates and millions in funds for the city, none of which would be possible without the sale of the systems,"" said Egg Harbor City Mayor Lisa Jiampetti.""We are ready to provide the residents of Egg Harbor City with reliable water and wastewater services, as we do for over 190 municipalities across the state,"" said Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water. ""Our plan includes rebuilding and modernizing the town’s water and wastewater infrastructure for continued quality and increased reliability while stabilizing rates and providing excellent customer service. Additionally, three of the city’s water and wastewater employees are joining our local operations team starting today.""Customers will begin receiving information from New Jersey American Water within the next week to facilitate a smooth transition.

To explore similar stocks, you can go see 5 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default.""When The Market Throws a Sale, I Tell You To Do Some Buying""On May 12, Jim Cramer noted the bleak market conditions, with major indices such as the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 being down by 222 points and 0.17%, respectively. However, instead of throwing caution to the winds, the Mad Money host decided it was time to dive into a financial history lesson to show just where to put your money to turn a profit at a time when spending even a penny may hurt.Based on ""the economic data"" Cramer has analyzed, he found it safe to say that ""the Federal Reserve may finally be out of the picture."" He expressed that the situation may have even ""cooled enough"" for the Fed to ""not need to hit us with any more rate hikes any time soon."" News like this can only be a cause for celebration for any investor, but as Cramer shows in his episode, it does not mean it's time to forget about contingency planning for your stock portfolios. The economic crisis that the US is going through is very much real and very much present. Cramer noted that ""based on the last debt ceiling crisis, this market could have a lot more downside"" before the US government gets a deal if they get one at all. Here are some comments from Cramer on potential developments:“Maybe the government ends up defaulting on its obligations. That's very much on the table, despite protestations from both sides of the aisle that it will never happen. Right now with the economy slowing and tax receipts coming up short, we might bump up toward the limit by the end of the month.”It's not just the US that has been suffering from debt. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles, global debt, in general, is surging. In 2020 alone, global debt rose by 30% to 263% of gross domestic product. However, the US at present seems to be at a stalemate regarding the debt ceiling deadline. Cramer noted that:Story continues“On the one side, you have President Biden, who's been unwilling to negotiate in any substantive form. On the other side, you have Speaker McCarthy who's giving the appearance of being willing to negotiate, but his suggestions have very little chance of leading to any meaningful compromise.”""The White House Will Have To Blink""Despite the situation recounted above, Cramer is confident that the White House will have to bow, seeing as ""President Biden is running for re-election next year."" Because of his future plans, Biden cannot ""afford to let a default happen, or even a recession sparked by fears of default."" Regardless of how the situation plays out in the coming months, Cramer is more interested in recommending the best stocks to tide investors by in this time of uncertainty. So he uses the example of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis to learn from and navigate the current crisis.By considering this past economic crisis, Cramer takes his audience through the many stocks and sectors that managed to weather the storm back in 2011. They included a range of companies from pharmaceutical corporations and fast food providers to major tech names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have remained popular for decades. According to Cramer, ""What worked back then can perhaps work now.""10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt DefaultOur MethodologyTo pick our stocks, we first watched Jim Cramer's episode on Mad Money from May 12. Cramer talks about a number of stocks and sectors that initially dropped during the 2011 economic decline but managed to climb back up better than all other stocks on the market. From these stocks, we selected the top 10 by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest number to the highest.The companies Cramer covers in his episode were among the first to be impacted by the 2011 debt ceiling crisis. However, as Cramer shows, they were also among the best performers at that time and managed to claw their way back up on the charts as much as they could. Several factors, such as consumer reliance on the products and services offered by these companies or their immense potential to grow in light of technological advancements today, can make the same thing happen for these companies during the present crisis. The tech names we've mentioned above are part of this cohort of stocks, and they have immense potential to remain resilient and profitable for investors today because of their deep involvement in artificial intelligence, according to Cramer.10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default10. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Cramer feels that those who are looking for a food stock should consider Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), a stock that is ""crushing it with cookies."" He believes that apart from ""consistent demand"" for its products, the company is also benefitting from a ""decline in cost resulting from the end of supply-chain problems from COVID, and lower commodity prices,"" alongside ""cheaper transport.""GLG Partners was the largest shareholder in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) at the end of the first quarter, holding 2.9 million shares.On May 1, analysts at Mizuho raised the price target on Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) shares from $78 to $86. The firm also held its Buy rating on the stock.There were 51 hedge funds long the stock in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $1.2 billion.9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Deutsche Bank holds a Buy rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as of May 1. The firm also raised its price target on the stock from $80 to $88.Cramer referred to Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) as a ""sleeping giant"" that has awoken, one that ""seems poised for a nice run""As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds held stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). Their total stake value in the company was $3.2 billion.Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is another stock that Cramer thinks can do well in the event of a debt default, in light of its past performance.8. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Of the 64 hedge funds long McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in the first quarter, Marshall Wace LLP was the most prominent stakeholder in the company, holding 1.6 million shares. The total stake value in the company was $4.04 billion.Alton Stump, an analyst at Loop Capital, holds a Buy rating and a $346 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares as of May 12.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) generated revenues of $5.9 billion, up by 4.1% year-over-year.Cramer thinks fast food stocks like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are definitely ""worth considering"" in times of economic crisis.7. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70On April 27, Barclays analysts raised the price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) from $201 to $206. The firm also reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Cramer believes that while The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has long been a stellar performer, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is ""the star of the show"" this time around. This development came in light of the company's monopoly on snack products, considering the fact that ""snacking has become far more ingrained in our lifestyle than it was in 2011.""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was noted among the portfolios of 70 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), has proven to be a resilient stock in times of economic crisis.6. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Cramer believes that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is ""on the cusp of the largest drug launch in ages."" The company's Mounjaro product, a ""revolutionary diabetes drug that doubles as a weight-loss treatment,"" may take its sales ""off the charts"" considering the obesity problem in the US.On May 26, Wells Fargo not only reiterated an Overweight rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares but also raised its price target on the stock from $440 to $500.Our hedge fund data shows 72 funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.GQG Partners held the most shares in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) at the end of the first quarter, coming in at 2.9 million shares.Fred Alger Management mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default. Suggested articles:Jim Cramer's Favorite Energy and Bank Stock PicksJim Cramer's Recession-Proof StocksJim Cramer's Comeback StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Management fees earned from Separate accounts declined 15.2% to $89.8 million.Total operating expenses amounted to $166.2 million, down 4.8% year over year.

Last year, the 7th Circuit said Boeing Co could not enforce a forum selection provision mandating that derivative claims be filed in Delaware Chancery Court.The court's six Republican-appointed judges rejected claims by Gap shareholder Noelle Lee that enforcing the forum selection clause would allow the company to avoid any litigation and effectively waive its obligations under federal securities law.The Gap, which is based in San Francisco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did Lee's lawyers at Bottini &amp; Bottini, which has brought similar shareholder lawsuits against Google parent Alphabet Inc, Oracle Corp, Qualcomm Inc and other companies. Those companies have denied wrongdoing.Lee in a 2020 lawsuit in San Francisco federal court said The Gap had failed to make progress in diversifying its senior leadership despite making statements to the contrary in securities filings. The Gap has maintained that the allegations in the lawsuit are ""offensive, racially charged and demonstrably false.""U.S. District Judge Sallie Kim in 2021 said the forum selection clause was enforceable and dismissed the case, and a 9th Circuit panel affirmed last year. The court granted en banc review and vacated the panel ruling in October.Story continuesLee's lawyers argued that the forum clause was unenforceable because it violated a provision in the Securities and Exchange Act barring corporate directors from waiving their legal obligations.On Thursday, Circuit Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote for the majority that the law only bars the waiver of substantive legal obligations imposed on company directors, and ""not the waiver of a particular procedure for enforcing such duties."" Ikuta said that shareholders will not be barred from suing because they can still file lawsuits on their own behalf in federal court, rather than derivative lawsuits on behalf of a company.But Circuit Judge Sidney Thomas, who penned the dissenting opinion, called The Gap's forum selection clause ""a litigation bridge to nowhere"" that deprives shareholders of any forum to pursue derivative claims.""The majority’s contrary conclusion renders the Exchange Act's protections meaningless,"" Thomas wrote.Thomas and the judges who joined him all are appointees of Democratic presidents.The case is Lee v.
