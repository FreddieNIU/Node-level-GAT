(NASDAQ:VRSK) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics Verisk Analytics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Lead Independent Director, Christopher Foskett, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$180 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$211, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 25% of Christopher Foskett's stake.Verisk Analytics insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesVerisk Analytics Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Verisk Analytics. In total, Lead Independent Director Christopher Foskett dumped US$1.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Verisk Analytics insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$201m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Verisk Analytics Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Verisk Analytics stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America.Over the years, the performance of value and growth stocks has fluctuated as it was influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, market cycles, and investor sentiment. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, value stocks outperformed growth equities during periods of high inflation. The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In our article 13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields, we reported that the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also highlighted analysts’ outlook for value stocks, mentioning that value equities will outperform the market cumulatively by 11.8% over the next three years.When investing in dividend stocks, many investors find undervalued dividend aristocrat stocks appealing because they offer the potential for both income generation and capital appreciation. Moreover, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market during periods of market downturns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same period, as reported by Insider Monkey in 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.

However, CF has slumped over the last six months as prices have fallen significantly.Inconsistent earnings have not helped and the stock is trading at 2023 lows after a recent earnings report. With analyst estimates falling further, investors could be in a rough spot in the back half of the year.About the Company CF Industries is headquartered in Deerfield, IL. The company was founded in 1946 and employs 2,700 people. Its principal products include anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate products. It primarily serves cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers, and industrial users.CF isvalued at $13.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 8. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value, but “D” in Momentum. The stock pays a dividend of 2.3%.Q1 Earnings The company reported Q1 earnings in early May, beating expectations by 8%. Revenues also came in above expected, but gross margins fell to 42.9% from 59.2% last year.Management commented that despite the downward pressure in the global nitrogen marketcompared to last year, industry fundamentals remain positive.The stock did spike on the headline number, but over the next few days, the stock made new monthly lows. This is not a good sign for investors and a reason for the drop is likely due to falling estimates.EstimatesWhile the recent earnings report has seen a mix of revisions to estimates, the trend so far this year has been lower. Looking at analyst estimates over the last 90 days, we see a significant drop across the board.  For the current quarter, estimates have been taken down from $3.70 to $2.68, a drop of 27%. For the current year, they have fallen from $13.29 to $8.98, or 32%.Story continuesNext year’s numbers have seen a drop of 14%, but we have seen a small tick higher over the last 7 days.Investors looking to buy the dip might have to wait until next year until the fundamental situation improves.Technical TakeCF has been on a downward trend since December of 2022. Since then, the stock has dropped about 35%.The 50-day moving average has been resistance multiple times since the stock started trending lower. This level, which is at $75.50, needs to break or the bears will continue to be in control.Investors are likely tempted to buy the dip, but there could be room lower. While there is value in the name, long-term support looks to be in the $55-60 range. That is over 15% lower than current prices, so investors should be patient.SummaryThe fertilizer names are great to be in when agriculture prices are going higher. Unfortunately, the trend is going the wrong way and until estimates start improving investors should hold off.For those interested in the space, a better option in the sector might be Sociedad Quimica Minera Chile SA(SQM).

(PRNewsFoto/Edwards Lifesciences Corporation)SVD can be caused by a buildup of calcium that may impact long-term durability of bioprosthetic valves. Heart valves with RESILIA tissue are designed to address calcification challenges of conventional tissue valves, potentially allowing valves with RESILIA to last longer. The RESILIA tissue data from the COMMENCE aortic trial reported encouraging results with low rates of SVD (99.3% freedom from SVD), clinically stable gradients and freedom from reoperation (97.2%) through seven years.""As bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement extends to younger and more active patients, valve durability is becoming increasingly important,"" said Thomas Beaver, M.D., Grant and Shirle Herron Chair, Professor and Chief of Cardiovascular Surgery, University of Florida College of Medicine. ""The seven-year data from the COMMENCE aortic trial demonstrates strong clinical outcomes and excellent durability in a study of younger patients with a mean age of 65.1 years.""Current technologies utilizing this novel tissue include the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic valved conduit, the MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve and the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA transcatheter aortic heart valve. In addition to its anti-calcification properties, RESILIA tissue also allows the valve to be stored under dry packaging conditions, facilitating ease of use in the operating room.""Edwards Lifesciences is committed to addressing the needs of patients with structural heart disease and our RESILIA tissue technology is designed for enhanced durability, supporting patients' improved quality of life,"" said Larry Wood, Edwards' corporate vice president and group president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart.

For more jobs, head on over to 5 Part Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience Required. The U.S. labor market has been at the center of debate for the past couple of months. This is due to the economic overheating in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight the aftermath. While economic growth is generally viewed positively, too much growth is also a bad thing since it leaves excessive cash flowing in the market which then results in inflation. So, during macroeconomic growth, firms see their businesses boom and end up hiring more people. This creates a scarcity in the labor market, and to compete for employees, the pay offered to them rises. This, in turn, leaves more disposable income for spending, which then ends up increasing the demand for goods, products, and services. This higher demand ends up straining manufacturing capacity, causing firms to raise their production costs and then by extension, prices.America, like other countries of the developed world, also sees teenagers start working while they're not at school or during summer break. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are 5.6 million teenagers (aged 16 to 19 years) employed in America. They are concentrated primarily in the retail trade and leisure and hospitality industry. Within the retail sector, out of the total 16 million people employed, this age group accounts for 1.3 million or nearly ten percent of the workforce. In the retail sector, the workers are employed primarily in warehouses, supercenters, general stores, and supermarkets (such as those operated by Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)). In the leisure and hospitality industry, teenagers account for a greater proportion of the workforce. According to the data, after employees aged between 25 and 34 years (2.9 million), the teenage group was the largest constituent of this industry since out of the total 13.7 million people employed, 2.3 million were 16 to 19 year olds. Within the hospitality sector, fast food restaurants (such as those operated by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)) were by far the largest employers of teenagers, as they employed 1.9 million out of the total 2.3 million.Story continuesNaturally, since these two industries are the largest employers for teenagers, it's relevant to take a look at what the future might hold for them. The Labor Department classifies Fast Food and Counter workers as part of the broader Food and Beverage Serving and Related Workers segment. According to its statistics, there were 4.1 million people employed in this category as of 2021. Apart from fast food counter workers, who take orders and deal with customers, other roles in this segment include waiters and servers. The median hourly wage for this category was $12.49 in 2021, with Fast Food and Counter workers making slightly lesser $12.07 per hour. Within the broader category, the top ten percent made more than $16.40 per hour while the bottom ten percent made less than $8.80. The Labor Department further estimates that jobs in the food and beverage serving and related roles will grow at 9% between 2021 and 2031 - which is faster than the 5% growth for all jobs in the U.S. as a whole.Moving toward the retail industry, the outlook is less rosy. Estimates show that from employing 15.3 million people in 2021, the Retail trade industry will see employees leave with the total number of workers estimated to sit at 15 million by 2031 end. In percentage terms, this represents a 0.2% drop in compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) terms until 2031. This is in opposition to the 0.5% growth that was recorded during the ten years between 2011 and 2021.As a whole, non-farm employment in America remained strong during March 2023. A total of 236,000 new jobs were added, with the unemployment rate sitting at a flat 3.5%. The new job addition was also driven by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added the highest amount of jobs, or 72,000 jobs out of the total 236,000 additions. However, the market is slowing down, as the latest additions were lower than the six month average of 95,000 new jobs. Within this industry, the food services and bars segment was the largest contributor, as it accounted for 50,000 of the total 72,000 new additions.Since the leisure and hospitality industry is both a significant employer of teenagers and a strong contributor to overall employment in America, it's also important to take a broad look at the industry's economic prospects. On this front, a research report from Facts and Factors believes that the hospitality industry will grow at a 10.24% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. This will enable it to grow from an estimated value of $3.9 trillion at the start of the forecast period to $6.7 trillion by its end. Astute readers will also note that the 10.24% CAGR is also in the same range as the job growth of 9% in the leisure and hospitality industry as mentioned above and predicted by the Labor Department.Finally, looking at the near term sales and trends in the retail industry, executives of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shared important details for them during the firm's fourth quarter of 2023 earnings call. During the event, they outlined:Walmart U.S. comps increased 8.3%, including 17% growth in e-commerce with a combination of pricing due in part to inflation and share gains. Sam’s Club U.S. delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 12.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco. And constant currency sales in Walmart International increased 5.5%, led by Walmex. As I discuss our profitability, it’s important to note the reorganization and restructuring charges within the International segment affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q4 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items. Gross margins were down 83 basis points, largely resulting from additional markdowns taken to address carryover inventory balances, mix headwinds and underlying inflation in our cost structure.On the near term outlook:We currently expect sales growth to be strongest in the first half then moderating in the second half, reflecting our macro assumptions and a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Because we will lap the benefit we received last year from insurance proceeds in 2Q, we expect operating income to be flat in 2Q relative to last year. We expect operating income growth to begin to outpace sales growth to a greater degree in the second half of the year versus the first half. In closing, I want to echo Doug’s Sentiment on our business. Over the last year, our team responded to some of the external challenges with the speed and nimbleness rarely seen in a company of our size and we exited the year in a much, much better place. As I reflect on where we are today, I’m more excited about our future than at any point in my time here.With these details in mind, let's take a look at part time jobs for 18 year olds with no experience required.Part Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience RequiredOur MethodologyTo compile our list, we consulted three reliable sources (1,2,3) for jobs for 18 year olds without any experience.

We need to think about energy security and climate security together now,"" she said in the interview last month. ""We hope China would move more into other ways of ensuring its energy security rather than going for coal.""Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Morgan said Germany also had energy security concerns but it reacted by building more renewable energy, making the system more efficient and having a flexible grid that could balance power supply and demand.""That's something that we've learned very much the hard way in the last year with the Russian war of aggression. As we have phased out all of our imports of Russian fossil fuels, our best energy security measure is to build out renewables ... and also [energy] efficiency.""China embarked on a massive expansion of its coal-fired power capacity following power outages across the country in 2021 and 2022 that were mostly caused by economic and weather-related factors.Before then, China had been looking to reduce its use of fossil fuels to meet its domestic carbon-neutral targets, but the blackouts led to renewed emphasis on coal as a source of energy. President Xi Jinping pledged in September 2020 to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.Last year, provincial governments approved a total of 106 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power capacity to be built - the most since 2015, according to a report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and Global Energy Monitor.Story continuesWork also started last year on 50GW of coal power capacity, an increase of more than half from a year earlier and six times the total for the rest of the world combined, according to the report.That pace of construction is only set to continue, with Greenpeace saying provincial governments approved at least 20GW of new coal power in the first quarter of this year, more than was given the go-ahead for all of 2021.Reducing fossil fuel emissions is central to realising the 2015 Paris Agreement, a commitment by 195 nations to limit global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius (36 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.The International Energy Agency said in November that ""reducing coal power sector emissions in line with the 1.5 degree Celsius goal means no new development of unabated coal-fired power plants"".The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, has forecast that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 with emissions cut in half by 2030.Representatives from around the world will meet in Dubai this year to assess just how much progress has been made towards the Paris goals.One of the bodies that could take a lead in meeting these targets is the Group of 20, whose members are responsible for about 80 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.Morgan said the G20 countries - which include China and Germany - should ""forge a way forward in increasing their [nationally determined contributions]"".""That's the group of countries that the world is looking at as it should drive forward that transformation, and hopefully under India's leadership of the G20 presidency this year, she said.""Several countries, including Germany, are very interested in being the leaders in innovation for the zero-carbon technologies that are needed. Having a benign competition for the green future is what the world needs to see.""Morgan said China and Germany had a long history of collaboration on energy and climate change, and climate change is already a focal point in bilateral relations.The two countries could accelerate the pace and scale of change, building more renewable energy, creating flexible and efficient grids, and developing a circular economy, she said.""That's good for our own countries, but also can be providing experience and examples for other countries as well.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:HIBISCS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's Improving ProfitsIn business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. Commendations have to be given in seeing that Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad grew its EPS from RM0.088 to RM0.38, in one short year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. On the revenue front, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 148% to RM2.5b but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's future profits.Are Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. With a whopping RM252m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That holding amounts to 13% of the stock on issue, thus making insiders influential owners of the business and aligned with the interests of shareholders.Does Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

19,fa3531b7-4c3d-321a-b0bb-29a511e98350,FE,2023-05-08,FirstEnergy's (NYSE:FE) investors will be pleased with their respectable 42% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergys-nyse-fe-investors-pleased-122454173.html,1683462294,STORY,['FE'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 17% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 7.0% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for FirstEnergy While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years of share price growth, FirstEnergy moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of FirstEnergy, it has a TSR of 42% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.3% in the last year, FirstEnergy shareholders lost 3.2% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for FirstEnergy   (of which 2 are potentially serious!) you should know about.We will like FirstEnergy better if we see some big insider buys.

Small-cap stocks within the Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM) have dragged as regional banking stocks within the SPDR Regional Bank ETF (KRE) continue to struggle.  However, despite the fear-mongering from many investors and the underperformance in some regions of the market, tech has marched higher in a stair-stepping fashion thus far in 2023. Currently, it is in the process of breaking out.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite a rough period of outperformance in 2022, it’s easy to see why investors are anxious to get exposure to the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). Over the past 20 years, the returns have been stellar from both a total return and a relative basis. Since 2003, the QQQ has returned 982.8% versus just 541.5% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThough tech has dominated in 2023, not all tech stocks are created equally. For example, former high-flying, lesser-quality tech stocks such as Block (SQ) and Zoom (ZM) are still stuck in downtrends. Conversely, stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have performed so well that they now account for nearly 14% of the S&amp;P 500 Index – the highest weighting for two companies in at least 40 years. So, it’s clear - investors are gravitating toward large-cap, institutional quality stocks with loads of cash.While stocks like AAPL, MSFT, and Shopify (SHOP) have performed well, new buyers looking to enter tech need to be strategic and not chase stretched charts. Below are three high-quality tech stocks setting up:My first pick is Alphabet (GOOGL). One of my favorite indications that a position will move higher occurs when a stock can shake off bad news quickly. My thinking is that if bad news is no news, no news should equate to good news.Story continuesIn early February, GOOGL shares tanked more than 10% after its AI chatbot Bard, made a mistake in its public-facing demo. While it was not a good look for the company or the stock, bargain hunters used the sell-off as an opportunity to accumulate shares. Last week, in a show of conviction, insiders scooped up a cool $20 million worth of the company’s stock. GOOGL is a mega-cap tech name that will essentially track the Q’s but should outperform to the upside over the next 6-12 months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMy next choice is Oracle (ORCL). Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft or Amazon Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the combination that makes for an excellent addition to any portfolio. Last week, Oracle broke out of a classic bull flag pattern on expanding volume.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhen discussing dominance and quality in the software space, it is impossible to leave out Salesforce (CRM). Salesforce is the world’s leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company. Though CRM’s earnings growth slowed briefly during the uncertainty of the pandemic, the company is beginning to reap the benefits of its recent acquisition spree. Over the past few years, CRM has acquired Microsoft Teams competitor Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, and Mulesoft. Furthermore, key strategic partnership agreements with Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN) have helped the company to bolster growth. Last quarter, earnings growth rocketed by 100% year-over-year.Beyond a resumption of strong growth, CRM is very attractive from a valuation perspective. CRM’s P/E ratio of ~37 is the lowest in at least ten years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnically, the stock is consolidating in a bullish manner as it approaches its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out earlier this year. The first pullback to the 50-day moving average should offer investors a low-risk entry point and give them a chance to gain a cushion in the stock before it reports earnings at the end of the month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

22,8192e4df-f0f9-388d-8981-d221cf0158a2,ALGN,2023-05-08,3 Overvalued S&P 500 Stocks to Dump Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-overvalued-p-500-stocks-130314180.html,1683118994,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'ANET', 'WST', 'ALGN']","[Given the S&amp;P 500’s 7.3% year-to-date advance and the threat of a recession in the second half of the year or early 2024, overvalued S&amp;P 500 stocks are more prevalent than investors realize.  At the end of February, JPMorgan Chase strategists suggested that because of real interest rates, stocks were 2.5 times too expensive. “Risk-reward for equities remains poor in our view, reinforcing our underweight equity stance,” JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said. The index is up 3.8% since those comments were made. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf the 503 stocks in the S&amp;P 500, approximately 160 are up more than the index YTD. Of those, 22 are up 30% or more. That’s where you’ll find some of the most overvalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell.   Using cash flow and free cash flow valuation metrics (price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow), I’ve selected three overvalued S&amp;P 500 stocks to avoid or sell. WSTWest Pharmaceutical Services$369.62ALGNAlign Technology $306.84ANETArista Networks$134.98West Pharmaceutical Services (WST)The West Pharmaceutical Services (WST) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comWest Pharmaceutical Services (NYSE:WST), which provides its healthcare clients with injectable solutions, drug delivery systems and other proprietary products that enable them to develop and bring life-saving drugs to market, is up 57.1% YTD. It currently has price-to-sales and price-to-cash-flow ratios of 9.6 and 39, respectively. Both metrics are at or above their five-year average. Another metric I use to assess fair value is free cash flow (FCF) yield, defined as trailing 12-month (TTM) FCF divided by market capitalization. As of Q1 2023, West’s TTM FCF was $410 million. Based on a market cap of $27.5 billion, it has an FCF yield of 1.7%. I consider anything below 4% to be potentially overvalued. In the first quarter of 2023, organic sales rose 2.3% to $716.6 million, while its operating cash flow decreased by 8.7% to $138.1 million. Those are hardly inspiring numbers. Story continuesAnalysts aren’t sold on West Pharmaceutical. Of the 11 analysts covering it, only five rate it “overweight” or “buy,” with an average target price of $359.25. That’s 2.8% below where it’s currently trading.   Align Technology (ALGN)a smartphone displays the Align (ALGN) logoSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comAlign Technology (NASDAQ: ALGN) lost more than 10% on April 27 after it reported disappointing Q1 results. Yet, even with the double-digit percentage post-earnings drop, shares of the maker of Invisalign teeth aligners are still up 45.5% on the year.The company reported first-quarter sales of $943.1 million and net income of $140.6 million. While revenue and net income were up on a sequential basis, they were down 3.1% and 21%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, thanks in part to higher expenses.Shares are trading at 6.7 times sales and 33.5 times cash flow. While those are lower than its five-year averages, growth has slowed substantially from 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, Align’s case volume was 558,563  (clear aligner constant currency net revenue of just over $768 million divided by revenue per case shipment of $1,375), 6.7% less than the 598,800 in Q1 2022.    Investors ought to be worrying that this stock’s best days were during the pandemic.Arista Networks (ANET)Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comCloud networking company Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) was doing very well on the year heading into its first-quarter earnings report on May 1. Shares were up 32% YTD and 142% over the past five years. Yet, despite reporting earnings and revenue beats, shares fell nearly 16% in May 2 trading, lowering the stock’s 2023 gain to 11.2%. On the top line, revenue of $1.35 billion was $40 million higher than analyst expectations. On the bottom line, it earned an adjusted $1.43 a share, 9 cents better than the consensus estimate. Additionally, its Q2 revenue guidance was higher than the analyst estimate. So, what is it that has investors selling? In a conference call with analysts, management admitted that big cloud companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) had driven demand for its cloud infrastructure products. “We expect some moderation in customer spending, especially with our cloud titan customers following a year of accelerated demand in 2022,” Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ita Brennan said. Prior to announcing, shares were trading at 11.6 times sales. That’s been cut to 8.4 as a result of the post-earnings sell-off. One analyst who thinks Arista is a buy after the sell-off is Needham’s Alex Henderson. Barron’s reported his comments to clients on May 2, with the analyst saying he views this decline as “an opportunity to Buy a best-in-class company.”I don’t see it that way. You can expect sales to slow in the second half of 2023. While the risk/reward proposition got a little better on the sell-off, ANET remains one of the overvalued S&amp;P 500 stocks that’s likely to fall further in 2023.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The PC-pioneer was quick to back OpenAI, the start-up behind transformational software ChatGPT. The Bill Gates-founded company signed a deal to use OpenAI’s technology in its Bing search engine and reportedly invested $10bn (£7.95bn) in the company.ChatGPT offers Microsoft a chance to leapfrog Google in search, but the technology offers far more than just that. Chief executive Satya Nadella has said AI will shape everything the company does in future.During an unexpectedly sunny visit to Microsoft’s usually rain soaked campus in Redmond, Washington, executives demonstrate ways in which they hope AI will boost its business.One example: the technology has been plugged into its Powerpoint software to help office workers complete hours of work on presentations in minutes.A series of bullet points fed to Copilot — Microsoft’s name for its AI chatbot integrations — result in the creation of an entire slide deck, complete with stock images, corporate branding and even the right colour scheme. Full sentences extrapolated from the terse bullet points garnish each slide.Undated handout photo issued by Microsoft of Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive, who has announced the new version of the Bing search engine which is powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT technology. The firm announced it is expanding the preview to its Bing and Edge web browser mobile apps and will continue to add more users who sign up for the waiting list to test the new tools. Issue date: Wednesday February 22, 2023. PA Photo. The revamped search engine uses OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, a form of generative AI which is able to respond to queries and hold human-like conversations with users as they interact with it.

Reuse of the picture may require further permission from the copyright holder. - Microsoft/PAWalter Sun, the company’s vice president of AI for business applications, believes Copilot could even become an “autopilot” by 2028. Rather than tasking a human to oversee the creation of a slide deck with the help of AI, an executive could simply ask software directly to do all the legwork.“We start by shipping features where there's a human in the loop to make sure everything works,” says Sun. “Maybe in five years, these things will become more self-service. I think it’s possible”.Copilot was first trialled commercially on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned collaboration website for software developers. Instead of humans writing code and then posting it to GitHub for others to critique (and borrow from), Microsoft used the GPT programme to create a virtual assistant capable of writing software code all by itself in response to user prompts.Story continuesAI assistants within Microsoft’s products will become ubiquitous, writing code, emails and Powerpoint presentations for people why they deal with less automatable tasks such as meetings and presentations.However, limiting the role of humans in day-to-day business raises knotty questions.“The question is, are we designing PowerPoint in a way that takes away my agency, my humanity?” asks Frank Shaw, the company’s marketing chief. “Or are we empowering them to spend more time on the parts that matter?”It is also an ominous portent for white collar workers. Just as advances in machinery have left scores of blue collar workers on the sidelines over the past century, AI could make many office jobs of today redundant.IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna recently said that thousands of back office staff are likely to be “replaced by AI and automation over the next five years”. The company is stopping hiring in some areas and investing in software instead.Connor Axiotes, a researcher at think tank the Adam Smith Institute, believes mass adoption of AI will lead to higher levels of unemployment in a way that no other past technologies have.“Future AI systems will have superhuman labour abilities, be smarter than humans, and encroach on a domain that no transformative technology ever has – cognitive labour,” he says.NEW YORK, NY - MAY 07: Elon Musk attends Heavenly Bodies: Fashion &amp; The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 7, 2018 in New York City. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images) - Steven Ferdman/Getty Images“That part of working ability which has been humanity's comparative advantage will no longer be so. This is why I think, more than ever, we are likely to see these stickier kinds of unemployment.”Jon Friedman, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of design and research, is sanguine.“In every age in the history of technology, the thing that we thought was going to replace human jobs created more human jobs,” he says.Microsoft’s representatives are keen to stress that the company wants to “augment” what people can do with AI instead of replacing them outright. Yet it is difficult to ignore the potential for AI to destroy jobs, even in its current state.Even as tech companies plough ahead, there’s the question of whether AI is good enough to do the job in the first place.During the Copilot trial on GitHub, one software developer complained that the AI sometimes “suggests things that are just wrong”. Another said using the product was akin to “having to deal with a trainee programmer who knows how to search on Google” — not a glowing endorsement.ChatGPT has a well documented tendency to “hallucinate”: produce convincing-sounding answers to questions that are in fact wrong. Plagiarism is also an issue when it comes to creating new material such as code or Powerpoint presentations.Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the British Computer Society, says that AI programmes such as ChatGPT are “only as good as the source of data” used to train them.He warns: “If somebody intentionally starts to poison some of the data sources, without you knowing about it, then that can create all kinds of ramifications, right?“We're all super excited about what can be done without really thinking through the potential risks.”Some people are: hundreds of tech leaders including Tesla chief executive Elon Musk penned a recent letter calling for a moratorium on AI development until the risks were properly understood. Meanwhile,  the “Godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton recently quit Google with a warning that AI was on the verge of becoming dangerously powerful.Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, has warned the technology “risks undermining the fabric of our society” by making the spread of convincing fake news so easy.At Microsoft, writing PowerPoint presentations appears a long way off the downfall of humanity.May0078295 The Daily Telegraph AI - Artificial Intelligence - Toronto, Ontario Canada. Professor Geoffrey Hinton, the British-born Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and known as The Godfather of AI. He divides his time working for Google and University of Toronto Pictured in his office at Google HQ in Toronto. Weds 16/08/17 - Julian SimmondsThe company is keen to press ahead with its advantage in AI, hoping to gain a crucial edge over rivals including Google and Amazon. If it does not, it risks falling behind.The cost of losing ground should not be underestimated. Google, whose experiments with AI have been lower-profile, saw $120bn wiped off its shares after a botched demo of its own chatbot, Bard, showed it giving a wrong answer.Professor Mike Wooldridge of the Alan Turing Institute says: “What we're seeing is a massive pivot in Big Tech towards this technology, because this finally delivered a mass market product for AI.“They're all broadly in the same sort of ballpark... But OpenAI and Microsoft have basically got a year's head start.”OpenAI ultimately aims to create “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), regarded by most researchers as the field’s Holy Grail: the creation of true machine consciousness. AGI would allow machines to essentially think for themselves and this breakthrough moment could be reached within years, some in the field believe.It is AGI that pessimists are most worried about. Once machines can be set off to complete tasks with relative autonomy, how can we control what they do? Thought experiments abound about how relatively simple commands could lead to the end of humanity.Would Microsoft adopt AGI if OpenAI creates it?“Honestly, I don’t know,” Eric Boyd, the company’s corporate vice president of AI platform technology, says in Redmond. It is difficult to speculate “on this thing that doesn’t exist”, he says.However, Boyd adds: “I can’t imagine we wouldn’t take advantage of some really advanced technology.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Archer-Daniels-Midland:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$59b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Food industry average of 10%. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland roceIn the above chart we have measured Archer-Daniels-Midland's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEArcher-Daniels-Midland is displaying some positive trends. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 12%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 30% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Our Take On Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with a respectable 98% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Most carriers voluntarily committed in August 2022 to providing hotels or meals but resisted providing cash compensation for delays.The Biden administration has objected to family seating fees, investigated 10 carriers for failing to provide refunds, pressed Southwest Airlines to do more after a holiday meltdown led to more than 16,000 flight cancellations and proposed other new consumer protections.USDOT will make clear starting Monday on a government website that no U.S. carriers have agreed to provide cash compensation for delayed or canceled flights under carriers' control.The Biden administration has sparred with U.S. airlines over who was to blame for hundreds of thousands of flight disruptions last year.Airlines for America, a trade association representing Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines , and others, said U.S. airlines ""have no incentive to delay or cancel a flight and do everything in their control to ensure flights depart and arrive on time, but safety is always the top priority.""U.S. airlines note the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acknowledges it does not have enough air traffic control staff and is operating 10% fewer flights than in 2019 to reduce pressure on the system.Story continuesIn October, Reuters first reported major U.S. airlines opposed USDOT plans to update its dashboard to show whether carriers would voluntarily compensate passengers for lengthy delays within airlines' control.USDOT said Monday the updated dashboard will show that one airline guarantees frequent flyer miles and two airlines guarantee travel credits or vouchers when cancellations or delays result in passengers' waiting three hours. No airline guarantees cash compensation.There is no legal requirement for airlines to compensate U.S. passengers for delayed or canceled flights, but the European Union and some other countries require compensation of up to 600 euros ($663) for most significant delays.

(NYSE:GSBD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript May 5, 2023Austin Neri: Good morning. This is Austin Neri, a member of the Investor Relations team for Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., and I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that all participants will be in listen-only mode until the end of the call when we open up the line for questions. Before we begin today's call I would like to remind our listeners that today's remarks may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the company's control. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially from that what is indicated in those forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in the company's SEC filings.This audio cast is copyrighted material of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Yesterday, after the market closed, the company issued an earnings press release and posted a supplemental earnings presentation both of which can be found on the home page of our website at www.goldmansachsbdc.com, under the Investor Relations section, and which include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These documents should be reviewed in conjunction with the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed yesterday with the SEC. This conference call is being recorded today, Friday, May 5, 2023, for replay purposes. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Chi, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs BDC.Alex Chi: Thank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'm here today with my Co-Chief Executive Officer, David Miller; Gabriella Skirnick, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Pessah, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call by providing a brief overview of our first quarter results before discussing the current market environment in more detail. I'll then turn the call over to David Miller to describe our portfolio activity before we hand it off to David Pessah to take us through our financial results. And finally, we'll open the line for Q&amp;A. So with that, let's get to our first quarter results. Our net investment income per share for the quarter was $0.46.Story continuesExcluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting in connection with the merger with MMLC, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $0.45 per share equating to an annualized net investment income yield on book value of 12.5%. The increase in returns is largely a reflection of the increase in base rates during the quarter. As we announced after the market closed yesterday, our Board declared a $0.45 per share dividend payable to the shareholders of record as of June 30, 2023. This marks the company's 33rd consecutive quarter of a $0.45 per share dividend totaling $14.85 per share since our IPO, excluding the special dividends we paid in 2021 post the merger with MMLC. Net asset value per share decreased to $14.44 per share as of March 31, a decrease of approximately 1.2% from the end of the fourth quarter.This decrease was primarily attributable to unrealized losses in more junior and non-first lean positions. On a fair value basis, first lien loans are 92.6% of assets as of March 31, which leaves us well-positioned to withstand potential headwinds in the current marketing environment. As we stated the last quarter, we have an emphasis within our pipeline on sourcing first lien senior secured investments. We also continue to remain dedicated to directly originated private credit opportunities and have not participated in the secondary market for broadly syndicated loans. During the quarter, we completed a follow-on public offering of common stock at an accretive offering price above NAV per share, which resulted in net cash proceeds of $97.6 million.David will expand on this in more detail below. Despite the continued media deal environment as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty coupled with the recent headwinds from the regional banking crisis during the quarter, we believe that the coming quarters may likely witness increased deal volumes through more strategic corporate actions, such as take private transactions or divestitures, as well as secondary LBOs. This view is further informed by increasing pipeline activity as well as the close dialogue we have with our Goldman Sachs investment banking colleagues. With that, let me turn over to my Co-CEO, David Miller.Building, real estate, businessPhoto by Alex Mihis on UnsplashDavid Miller: Thanks, Alex. During the quarter, we originated $2.1 million in new investment commitments, half of the amount in new investments to one new portfolio company and half as part of a follow-on investment to one existing portfolio company, primarily to finance M&amp;A activity. Our new investment commitments were a 100% in first lien senior secured loans. Sales and repayment activity totaled $12.6 million, primarily driven by the full repayment of investments by one Portfolio Company. We are pleased to note that this full repayment was by Tronair which was previously a watchlist name for us and a position that was a three on our risk matrix. Of note, Tronair was marked at 94 as of quarter end December 31 and was repaid at par.Turning to portfolio composition, as of March 31, 2023, total investments in our portfolio were $3.5 billion at fair value comprising 97.4% in senior secured loans, including 89.3% in first lien, 3.3% in first lien/last-out unitranche, and 4.8% in second lien debt, as well as a negligible amount in unsecured debt, and 2.4% in a combination of preferred and common stock and warrants. We also had $325.2 million of unfunded commitments as of March 31, bringing total investments at fair value and commitments to $3.8 billion. As of quarter end, the company held investments in 133 portfolio companies operating across 37 different industries. Weighted average yield of our investment portfolio at cost at the end of Q1 was 11.6% as compared to 11.0% from the prior quarter.The weighted average yield of our total debt in income producing investments at amortized cost increased to 12.2% at the end of Q1 from 11.7% at the end of Q4. Turning to credit quality. The weighted average net debt to EBITDA of the companies in our investment portfolio had a slight decrease to 6.0x at quarter end from 6.1x at the end of the fourth quarter. Given the level of existing base rates, we would anticipate that future originations and transactions should reflect lower leverage metrics. Just as importantly, and in response to your questions some of you have had with regard to macro headwinds over the past few quarters, our portfolio companies had both top-line and EBITDA growth on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. As Alex discussed earlier, deal activity was muted throughout the quarter.Nonetheless, we expect sponsored dry powder coupled with management and active shareholder activity to seize current opportunities in the marketplace to drive future pipeline activity. We remain selected from a credit and risk adjusted return perspective and maintain a long-term strategic view on capital deployment that is insulated by our orientation to first lien credit risk. The weighted average interest coverage of the companies in our investment portfolio at quarter end was 1.6x, which was flat relative to our prior quarter. It's important to note that we calculate our coverage ratios based on current quarter metrics rather than a trailing or LTM basis. Were we to use an LTM calculation, then our coverage ratio of the companies in our investment portfolio would be 2.3x.And finally, turning to asset quality. As of March 31, 2023, investments on non-accrual status amounted to 0.6% and 1.6% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and amortized cost respectively versus 0.3% and 2.1% at fair value and amortized cost respectively as of the quarter ended December 31, 2022. We had one junior non-first lien position placed on non-accrual and one Portfolio Company removed from non-accrual status as we exited the position. I will now turn the call over to David Pessah to walk through our financial results.David Pessah: Thank you, David. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $3.5 billion, outstanding debt of $1.9 billion, and net assets of $1.6 billion. Our ending net debt to equity ratio decrease to 1.2x from 1.32x last quarter. As Alex mentioned on March 6, we opportunistically completed a follow-on public offering of common stock at an accretive offering price above NAV per share. The offering resulted in net cash proceeds of $97.6 million, which we used to reduce our leverage. The lowered leverage levels allow us to deploy capital into attractive risk adjusted opportunities in the current market. At quarter end 44.3% of the company's total principal amount of debt outstanding was in unsecured debt and $612 million of capacity was available under our secured revolving credit facility.Before continuing to the income statement, as a reminder, in addition to GAAP financial measures, we will also reference certain non-GAAP or adjusted measures. This is intended to make the company's financial results easier to compare to results prior to our October 2020 merger with MMLC. These non-GAAP measures remove the purchase discount amortization impact from our financial results. For Q1, GAAP and adjusted after-tax net investment income were $48 million and $47.1 million, respectively, as compared to $67.6 million and $66.6 million, respectively in the prior quarter. The increase in quarter-over-quarter top-line investment income was primarily due to the increase in benchmark rates. The decrease in net investment income was due to the increase in our incentive fee.As a reminder, our incentive fee calculation is based on a 12 quarter look back inclusive of a total return limiter where any unrealized losses resulting from markdowns offset pre-incentive fee net investment income. For the current quarter results from Q1 2020 were removed from the calculation, which included results from the initial impact of COVID-19 and meaningfully limited the amount of incentive fees that could be earned during the trailing 12 quarter period. Further, we voluntarily waived a portion of our fees during that same period including the quarter ended March 31, 2023, exemplifying our commitment and orientation to being shareholder friendly. On a per share basis, GAAP net investment income was $0.46, and adjusted net investment income was $0.45 as compared to $0.66 and $0.65 respectively last quarter.Our spillover taxable income is approximately $85 million or $0.78 on a per share basis, which we believe provides continuous stability on our consistent dividend since inception. Distributions during the quarter totaled $0.45. Net asset value per share on March 31, 2023 was $14.44 as compared to $14.61 last quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Alex for closing remarks.Alex Chi: Thanks, David. In conclusion, thank you all for joining us on our call. While the deal environment was muted again this quarter, we are encouraged by some green shoots developing as our pipeline begins to improve. Moreover, our improved leverage profile allows us to capitalize on new opportunities as transaction volumes evolve. We appreciate your time and attention today. With that, let's open the line for Q&amp;A.See also 25 Best Countries for Green Living and 10 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy Now.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This takes the dividend yield to 5.4%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt Leggett &amp; Platt's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The last payment made up 88% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 2.7% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 93% in the next 12 months, which is on the higher end of the range we would say is sustainable.historic-dividendLeggett &amp; Platt Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.12 total annually to $1.76. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.6% over that duration. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Leggett &amp; Platt hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.Our Thoughts On Leggett &amp; Platt's DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Leggett &amp; Platt's payments are rock solid. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We don't think Leggett &amp; Platt is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

(Nasdaq: HOLX), a global leader in women’s health, today announced a partnership with recently drafted NFL cornerback Kelee Ringo and his mother, breast cancer survivor Tralee Hale, to educate women on the importance of prioritizing annual mammograms and other key health screenings.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230508005184/en/NFL cornerback Kelee Ringo and his mother, breast cancer survivor Tralee Hale (Photo: Business Wire)Ringo is a two-time national champion from the University of Georgia who was recently drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles. The launch of the partnership with Hologic is timed with Mother’s Day and National Women’s Health Week (May 14-20, 2023), when Ringo and Hale will share the powerful story of Hale’s breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and recovery.Hale’s story is a familiar one: a woman who did not prioritize her preventive care screenings as she focused on managing her family, career and other commitments. As a single mother, she was diagnosed with breast cancer just days after Ringo began his freshman year in college. She is now cancer-free after completing treatment, but Ringo and Hale know how lucky they are and want to encourage women not to delay annual screenings.""Kelee and Tralee’s story resonates with all of us because we have heard from women — time and again — who have prioritized their families and other responsibilities while putting their own health screenings on the back burner,"" said Erik Anderson, Hologic’s Division President of Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. ""Hearing how much they mean to one another and how this experience impacted them was incredibly moving.

Moore started his television writing career in 1989 in a junior-level job on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" before he rose through the ranks to produce hits such as ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Outlander.""That path to success is hard to find in today's Hollywood, Moore and other writers say, and is one reason the Writers Guild of America (WGA) called a strike that began May 2 and has shut down late-night television and threatens to undermine the crucial fall TV season.""If I was starting today, it would be a much harder business than when I started my career,"" Moore, 58, said while picketing outside Comcast Corp's Universal Studios in Burbank, California.How to train and support a new generation of writers is a sticking point in contract negotiations between the WGA, which represents 11,500 film and TV writers, and Hollywood's major studios. Both sides agree that changes brought by TV's streaming revolution have reduced opportunities to work on sets and see first-hand how television is made.A decade ago when broadcast shows dominated television, seasons typically ran for 22 episodes. After one or two were written, filming would start and the writing team would go to the set to help with rewrites and production. Eventually, they could work their way up to running their own series.Netflix Inc and other streaming services began crafting shorter series in ""mini rooms"" with fewer writers. For a streaming show, 10 to 12 episodes are written all at once, and many of the writers are dismissed before filming begins.While reducing their potential pay, this system also ""is limiting the experience levels of those writers,"" said John August, a member of the WGA negotiating team. ""They're not going to learn how to make a show.""COLLABORATION WITH ACTORSWriters often rework scripts during production, for various reasons. An outdoor scene, for example, could be moved inside because of bad weather, requiring changes, said ""Boardwalk Empire"" writer Cristine Chambers. Input from actors can lead to revisions.Story continues""Having the ability to talk to actors changes the script,"" Chambers said. ""Suddenly I'm seeing something from (the actor's) point of view. It's a collaboration.""Hollywood studios made a proposal to help early-career scribes. They suggested having a showrunner identify a promising writer to bring to the set, similar to a Directors Guild of America program, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. The younger writer would be paid a stipend.The WGA, however, is seeking a requirement for at least six TV writers per series, with half of them being employed throughout the production. To the studios, that requirement is impractical and could lead to writers being paid for months while waiting for filming to start.""These proposals require the employment of writers whether they're needed for the creative process or not,"" said the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the group negotiating on behalf of Walt Disney Co, Universal, Netflix and other studios.""It is in reality a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry,"" the AMPTP added.The studios have offered increases in wage and residual payments to address complaints that writers are working more and making less, and that compensation is not high enough for many writers to make a living wage in New York and Los Angeles.The WGA is asking for larger pay raises than the studios have proposed and rewards for writers with more experience.Now, half of all writers work at minimum salary levels, the WGA said. ""The companies have turned the ladder of economic success for writers into a step stool,"" said Chris Keyser said, co-chair of the WGA negotiating committee.On the picket lines, aspiring writers such as 25-year-old Carrie Smith have joined WGA members, hoping to help the Guild secure a deal with better terms to help them build a career.""I want to be part of fighting for a better future,"" Smith said while holding a ""Writers Guild of America On Strike"" sign. ""You can't climb a broken ladder."" (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Mary Milliken and Diane Craft)]"

For more comedy movies, head on over to 10 Best Comedy Movies on Netflix. The box office has been around for almost a century now, with some movie studios and production companies having existed for even longer. The oldest studio in the U.S. is Universal Pictures, which was set up initially as a group of nickelodeons but soon evolved to the Universal Film Manufacturing Company after Thomas Edison's Edison Trust tried to establish a monopoly on motion picture viewing and asked for more royalty payments from the Nickelodeons. The rest, as they say, is history, with Universal Pictures being one of the largest production studios in the world and being responsible for some of the greatest hits in film history such as Furious 7 and Jurassic World. As for Edison Trust's fate, its meddling with the film industry is the reason that today the U.S. movie sector is called Hollywood and not New York, as all film producers moved to Hollywood to avoid the patent bullying, a decision that started the company's decline, with its fate sealed in 1918 after a federal court ruled its fee collection practices excessive and a barrier to free trade.Naturally, since it is one of the oldest modern day industries, the film sector has also evolved with the passage of time. However, before we get to that, you might be surprised to know that the first film was actually shown in France and not in America. This movie was shown on a widescreen through the world's first projector and consisted of a collection of fictional and real storylines. Since then, however, the film industry has evolved to show viewers content in three dimensions and IMAX - which has larger frames than typical projections. However, despite being popularized recently, 3D films are not a new phenomenon and have been present since the early 1900s.Despite all these advances, the ability to watch a movie from the comfort of one's home still holds significant attraction, and this is where the rise of the world's most popular online video streaming service Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) comes into play. Netflix is an American company headquartered in Los Gatos, California, and it initially started as a DVD distribution service. For our younger readers, DVDs were physical disks that replaced video cassettes for delivering movies and often saw films in high definition delivered straight to the viewer's home. DVDs reigned supreme in the content delivery market until very recently when the widespread availability of high speed internet connections replaced the need to own physical storage disks since content could simply be streamed online.Story continuesAnd right at the time when the Internet was disrupting content delivery, Netflix was present in all its glory to take advantage through having an already well established platform that provided users with an advanced and easily accessible service. Netflix had introduced video on demand years before the rise of the industry, as it entered the market in 2007. A couple of years later, the company also started to release content that it had produced itself, with its first television series, House of Cards, being an instant hit. The effects of its ability to ride the wave of the Internet are visible in the share price as well.Netflix's shares were trading at $4 when it entered the video on demand market, had appreciated tenfold in 2011 when House of Cards was released, and peaked to a whopping $690 during the coronavirus pandemic when global lockdowns forced people to turn to indoor avenues for entertainment. The company's relaxed and user friendly nature also made it allow password sharing for its platform, but the constant threat of investors breathing down its neck to earn more money is forcing it to roll back this feature - much to the dismay of its 231 million paid subscribers. The share price has also retreated from its all time highs and is currently at $322 per share.The investor pressure to make Netflix  cut down on account sharing is bolstered by the market value of the company's industry. A research report from Fortune Business Insights suggests that the global video on demand industry was worth $69 billion in 2021 and grew to $82.7 billion last year. The industry has one of the strongest compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) that we've come across, which, according to the research firm, sits at 17.5%. This rate should let the industry grow to $257 billion by the end of 2029.Netflix also announced a big change in January 2023, when the firm's co founder and CEO Mr. Reed Hastings decided to step down from his role. The company also shared details about the extent of password sharing on its platform in a shareholder letter where it explained:Later in Q1, we expect to start rolling out paid sharing more broadly. Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business. While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly. So we’ve worked hard to build additional new features that improve the Netflix experience, including the ability for members to review which devices are using their account and to transfer a profile to a new account. As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with. As is the case today, all members will be able to watch while traveling, whether on a TV or mobile device.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top comedy movies on Netflix.35 Best Comedy Movies on NetflixPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe narrowed down the list of best comedy movies by picking Rotten Tomatoes' top fifty comedies on Netflix streaming and DVD.

For more detective movies, head on over to 10 Best Detective Movies on Netflix. Video on demand, commonly known as streaming, is a global phenomenon. Just a couple of years back, no one would have thought that a laptop or a smartphone would end up serving as a conduit to massive entertainment portals with hundreds of different television shows and movies just a click away. Yet, here we are, and not only is the industry worth billions of dollars, but it is also primed for massive growth.In fact, you'd be surprised to learn that the global streaming market is worth billions of dollars. A market research report from Fortune Business Insights estimates that the global video streaming market was worth $372 billion in 2021 and was estimated to grow to $473 billion by the end of last year. As if this weren't enough, the research firm further estimates that the industry will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9% until 2029 to sit at an estimated $1.6 trillion by the end of the forecast period - making it one of the most valuable sectors on the planet. According to Fortune Business Insights, this growth has been stimulated by the coronavirus pandemic, as lockdowns and work from home mandates instilled habits in people that have now taken root. It adds that firms are racing to develop low latency streaming technologies to improve user experience, and higher user spending on digital entertainment is further aiding the market.While the global streaming market is also made up of other sectors such as healthcare streaming, the video on demand subsector is an accurate indicator of pureplay content streaming. On this front, Fortune Business Insights estimates that this market was worth $69.55 billion in 2021 and grew to $82.77 billion in 2022. From then on, it is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 17.6% to be worth $257 billion by the end of 2029. As is evident, the video on demand market will grow slower than the broader streaming sector - unsurprising as some of the most explosive growth has already been accounted for during the coronavirus pandemic. The research firm adds that growth in social media and higher usage of the Internet has fueled the growth for video on demand, and that moving forward, cable television will play a dominant role in the market as interest and adoption in developing and growing countries such as India and Brazil grows.Story continuesWith the broader market out of the way, let's focus our attention on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix is by the far the most popular streaming service on the planet. This is due to the simple fact that the firm enjoys an early mover advantage - with the age old adage of the early bird getting the worm fitting perfectly here. In fact, according to data compiled by Visual Capitalist, Netflix is by far the dominating streaming platform globally as it leads in subscribers in 78 countries. In the second place is the streaming service Canal Plus, which leads in 22 countries. Cumulatively, Netflix leads in more countries than the next seven streaming services on Visual Capitalist's list. Additionally, while the company has a global advantage, its competitors are limited to regions. For instance, Canal Plus, which shares content primarily in French, is the leader in francophone countries, with similar trends in play for Shahid - who ranks at third place and is popular in Arabic speaking regions.Like other technology firms, Netflix is not immune to the current turbulent macroeconomic environment which has seen the costs of doing business soar right at the time when consumer purchasing powers are dropping. According to a report from Bloomberg, the firm is merging its film production studios and letting go of executives who have served at the firm for decades. This is part of efforts to produce fewer films each year and consolidate decision making at the board instead of a decentralized model that saw different divisions remain in charge of their own productions. These moves follow after Netflix's co founder Mr. Reed Hastings left the company earlier this year and the firm races towards cracking down on password sharing on its platform. New features to stop this rolled out in Canada earlier this year, with users in America apprehensive about what this means for their binge-watching habits.As to how it will manage this fundamental shift on its platform, the firm outlined in its fourth quarter of 2022 shareholder letter shared earlier this year that:In addition, we expect to roll out paid sharing more broadly later in Q1’23 (more details below in the Product and Pricing section). We anticipate that this will result in a very different quarterly paid net adds pattern in 2023, with paid net adds likely to be greater in Q2’23 than in Q1’23. From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing, which impacts near term member growth. But as borrower households begin to activate their own standalone accounts and extra member accounts are added, we expect to see improved overall revenue, which is our goal with all plan and pricing changes.Our long term financial objectives remain unchanged - sustain double digit revenue growth, expand operating margin and deliver growing positive free cash flow. For the full year 2023, as we continue to improve our service, grow our advertising business and launch paid sharing, we expect constant currency revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. We also expect year over year operating profit growth and operating margin expansion for the full year (assuming no material swings in F/X).With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top detective flicks on Netflix. After all, you never know when account sharing becomes a thing of the past.Best Detective Movies on Netflix Photo by Ashley Byrd on UnsplashOur Methodology We cast a wide net to pick out the top thriller movies on Netflix by consulting different sources such as Rotten Tomatoes.

Early last month, the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — shocked the market with unexpected production cuts. Essentially, the decision sent the message that foreign entities can influence the dollar’s trajectory.Considering that these oil-rich countries don’t always have our best interests in mind, it’s always possible that another energy shock can disrupt global affairs. As well, normalization trends from the Covid-19 crisis may help organically boost demand. Notably, vehicle miles traveled have steadily moved higher since the pandemic lull, boding cynically well for cheap energy stocks. However, many energy players can still be had for a discount.

So far this year, EPM is off to a rough start, losing more than 9% of equity value. Nevertheless, EPM could rank among the best undervalued energy stocks to buy.According to investment resource Gurufocus, Evolution rates as a significantly undervalued enterprise. By the numbers, EPM trades at a trailing multiple of 5.09. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 65.82% of the competition. Also, EPM trades at 2.99-times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat pings at 4.5 times.Story continuesAdditionally, Evolution benefits from myriad other financial strengths. Aside from a cash-rich balance sheet, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at an impressive 35.9%. Also, its trailing-year net margin smokes the competition of cheap energy stocks at 29.52%.Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (MGY)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockFeaturing extensive acumen in the exploration and production industry, Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (NYSE:MGY) operates in South Texas. Carrying a market capitalization of $4.27 billion, Magnolia slides nicely among the mid-cap undervalued energy stocks to buy. However, MGY will require some patience, with shares stumbling 10% since the beginning of this year.Still, the red ink in the charts presents a possible fundamental discount. Right now, MGY trades at a multiple of 4.24. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than 71.34% of companies listed in the oil and gas industry. Also, MGY trades at 4.49-times free cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is a loftier 7.07 times. As with Evolution Petroleum, Magnolia also enjoys other financial strengths. Primarily, it benefits from a stout balance sheet. Also, it enjoys decent revenue growth and a blisteringly hot net margin of 52.75%.Finally, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target is $30.42, implying over 52% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)Man holding stacks of money.

To execute on this vision, NextEra Energy Partners will focus on its core strengths, eliminate a significant amount of near-term convertible equity portfolio financing obligations, reduce equity needs and simplify and recapitalize the business, all of which are intended to deliver long-term unitholder value.(PRNewsfoto/NextEra Energy Partners, LP)""Since launching NextEra Energy Partners in 2014, we've delivered significant growth, increased our renewables portfolio by approximately nine times and have become one of the largest clean energy generators in the world,"" said John Ketchum, chairman and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy Partners. ""We have a terrific track record, but we believe NextEra Energy Partners' future growth potential is not reflected in its current valuation. We believe this disconnect is driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and concerns around the equity required to finance the partnership's convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts. Today, we are announcing plans to simplify the partnership's capital structure and singularly focus on a 100% renewable energy strategy. The U.S. economy's ongoing transition to renewable energy is a significant driver of future renewable energy investments, and we want NextEra Energy Partners to be well positioned to capitalize on these investments.Story continues""To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026. These actions would both increase our renewable energy investments and eliminate the equity issuance that would otherwise be required to complete all three convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts planned for 2023, 2024 and 2025,"" Ketchum said. ""Under our plan, we currently do not expect any equity to be required to finance our growth plan through 2024 and do not expect any equity issuances to finance convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts through 2025. The end result of these changes is intended to create the leading 100% renewables pure-play investment opportunity for the benefit of unitholders.""NextEra Energy Partners' plan to capitalize on the clean energy transition includes the following:First, NextEra Energy Partners is launching a process to sell its STX Midstream and Meade natural gas pipeline assets in 2023 and 2025, respectively. Upon closing of the sales, the excess proceeds would be used to buy out the STX Midstream, 2019 NEP Pipelines and NEP Renewables II convertible equity portfolio financings. Once completed, the only planned convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts with equity requirements through 2026 would be the Genesis Holdings convertible equity portfolio financing, which is limited to $294 million in 2026.Second, NextEra Energy Partners expects to use the excess proceeds from the sale of its interest in natural gas pipeline assets to finance its growth, eliminating all equity requirements through 2024 other than opportunistic equity issuances under its at-the-market equity issuance program to fund future growth beyond 2024.Third, to replace the cash available for distribution (CAFD) from the expected divested pipeline assets, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) and NextEra Energy Partners have entered into an agreement to suspend NextEra Energy's incentive distribution rights (IDR) fees in respect of all quarters in 2023 through 2026. By suspending the IDR fees, the partnership will be able to use that cash flow to largely replace the reduced CAFD that would be associated with the sale of the natural gas pipeline assets.Upon successfully completing the sales of the natural gas pipeline assets, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to achieve Real Zero carbon emissions in 2025 and become the leading 100% renewables pure-play investment opportunity. The partnership believes these changes could potentially invite a new class of investors looking for a carbon-free, pure-play option to participate in the energy transition.In summary, the plan would eliminate the equity buyouts of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings via the divestiture of the partnership's interest in natural gas pipeline assets, and the CAFD associated with the sale of the natural gas pipeline assets would be largely replaced by the IDR fees suspension. NextEra Energy Partners expects that it would have excess proceeds from the natural gas pipeline sales available to eliminate equity requirements to fund future growth through 2024.NextEra Energy Partners believes it is well positioned to execute against its plan due to its ample liquidity and significant financing capacity. The partnership had approximately $2.8 billion of available liquidity as of March 31, 2023.Outlook From a base of its fourth-quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, NextEra Energy Partners continues to see 12% to 15% growth per year in limited partner distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. Given the current capital markets environment, the partnership expects to grow distributions at or near the bottom end of this range. NextEra Energy Partners expects the annualized rate of the fourth-quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners currently has no plans to issue incremental convertible equity portfolio financings.NextEra Energy Partners' run-rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at Dec. 31, 2023, remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and CAFD of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar-year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023.The expectations discussed herein are subject to the usual caveats.This news release refers to adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectations. NextEra Energy Partners' adjusted EBITDA expectations represent projected (a) revenue less (b) fuel expense, less (c) project operating expenses, less (d) corporate G&amp;A, plus (e) other income less (f) other deductions including IDR fees. Projected revenue as used in the calculations of projected EBITDA represents the sum of projected (a) operating revenues plus (b) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, plus (c) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits plus (d) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits and plus (e) the reimbursement for lost revenue received pursuant to a contract with NextEra Energy Resources.CAFD is defined as cash available for distribution and represents adjusted EBITDA less (1) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, less (2) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits, less (3) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits, less (4) debt service, less (5) maintenance capital, less (6) income tax payments less, (7) other non-cash items included in adjusted EBITDA if any. CAFD excludes changes in working capital and distributions to preferred equity investors.Adjusted EBITDA, CAFD and limited partner distributions and other expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S.; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion support for wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD do not represent substitutes for net income, as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run-rate expectations have not been reconciled to expected net income because NextEra Energy Partners' net income includes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivative transactions, which cannot be determined at this time.NextEra Energy Partners, LPNextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: NEP) is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE). NextEra Energy Partners acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows.

NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the United States of America and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; If the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; Reductions in demand for natural gas in the United States or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utility holding companies, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; The natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; Under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates.

NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC  under certain limited circumstances; if the agreements with NEE Management or NEER are terminated, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; if NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; Holders of NEP's units may be subject to voting restrictions; NEP's partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that NEP GP and NEP's directors and officers might have to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing their duties and the NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP's directors or NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; Certain of NEP's actions require the consent of NEP GP; Holders of NEP's common units currently cannot remove NEP GP without NEE's consent and provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable; NEE's interest in NEP GP and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; Reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; the liability of holders of NEP's units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; the issuance of common units, or other limited partnership interests, or securities convertible into, or settleable with, common units, and any subsequent conversion or settlement, will dilute common unitholders' ownership in NEP, may decrease the amount of cash available for distribution for each common unit, will impact the relative voting strength of outstanding NEP common units and issuance of such securities, or the possibility of issuance of such securities, as well as the resale, or possible resale following conversion or settlement, may result in a decline in the market price for NEP's common units; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate net operating losses (NOLs) sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; and, Distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America.Over the years, the performance of value and growth stocks has fluctuated as it was influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, market cycles, and investor sentiment. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, value stocks outperformed growth equities during periods of high inflation. The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In our article 13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields, we reported that the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also highlighted analysts’ outlook for value stocks, mentioning that value equities will outperform the market cumulatively by 11.8% over the next three years.When investing in dividend stocks, many investors find undervalued dividend aristocrat stocks appealing because they offer the potential for both income generation and capital appreciation. Moreover, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market during periods of market downturns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same period, as reported by Insider Monkey in 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.

The following is a summary of the updated outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook for revenues, capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity and tax rate for fiscal 2023. Certain of the outlook numbers include adjusted operating margin (a non-GAAP metric) for each segment. The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2023 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2023 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of and the amount of any potential applicable future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for these forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating margin should not be considered a substitute for operating margin or any other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.Beginning in fiscal 2022, we launched a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making. We targeted an aggregate $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. We realized more than $700 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, which partially offset the impacts of inflationary market conditions, and we have surpassed our aggregate $1 billion target as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, more than a year ahead of our plan.BeefUSDA projects domestic production will decrease approximately 4% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of (1)% to 1% in fiscal 2023 as margins are expected to decrease.PorkUSDA projects domestic production will be relatively flat in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate adjusted operating margin of (2)% to 0% in fiscal 2023.ChickenUSDA projects chicken production will increase approximately 3% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of (1)% to 1% for fiscal 2023.Prepared FoodsWe anticipate an adjusted operating margin of 8% to 10% in fiscal 2023 driven by volume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management.International/OtherWe anticipate improved results from our foreign operations in fiscal 2023.RevenueWe expect sales to be $53 billion to $54 billion in fiscal 2023.Capital ExpendituresWe expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures include spending for capacity expansion and utilization, automation to alleviate labor challenges and brand and product innovation.Net Interest ExpenseWe expect net interest expense to approximate $340 million for fiscal 2023.LiquidityWe expect total liquidity, which was approximately $2.2 billion at April 1, 2023, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.0 billion. On May 3, 2023 we entered into $1.75 billion of new term loan facilities.Tax RateWe currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 22% for fiscal 2023.TYSON FOODS, INC.CONSOLIDATED

Net debt to EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis.We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA). Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.TYSON FOODS, INC.Adjusted EPS Non-GAAP Reconciliation(In millions, except per share data)(Unaudited) Second Quarter Six Months Ended Pretax Impact EPS Impact Pretax Impact EPS Impact 2023 2022  2023  2022  2023   2022   2023   2022                 Reported net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson (GAAP EPS)    $(0.28) $2.28     $0.61  $5.35                 Add (Less): Production facilities fire insurance proceeds, net of costs 3$— $5  —   0.01 $(35) $(40)  (0.07)  (0.09)                Add: Restructuring and related charges$22 $—  0.05   — $43  $—   0.09   —                 Add: Plant closures$92 $—  0.19   — $92  $—   0.19   —                 Less: Remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities at lower enacted state tax rates$— $—  —   — $—  $—   —   (0.10)                Adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson (Adjusted EPS)    $(0.04) $2.29     $0.82  $5.16 Adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson (Adjusted EPS) is presented as a supplementary measure of our financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.

See for yourself by starting a 7-day free trial.Apple comes out aheadOn Thursday Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) topped first-quarter estimates with earnings per share of $1.54 vs. the $1.43 average analyst estimate, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone sales.Apple also boosted its dividend and announced a $90 billion share buyback program.Goldman Sachs raised the price target to $209 per share on Buy-rated AAPL stock after ""strong"" results:""We gain confidence in our Buy rating and believe AAPL shares continue to be attractive.""KeyBanc also hiked the price target, to $180 per share from the prior $177, noting that Emerging Markets strength a the tech giant offloaded weaker U.S. results.Shares were up more than 2% for the week.AMD's roller coaster weekAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a better-than-expected Q1 on Tuesday but issued disappointing guidance, triggering a 9% selloff in the shares in the next session.BofA cut the stock to Neutral from Buy, citing a ""range of headwinds"" including ""aggressive pricing/promotion pressure from main rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).""Citi, for its part, raised the price target on AMD stock to $85 per share, and BMO highlighted the company's continued market share gains against Intel.Then, on Thursday afternoon, shares clawed most of their way back following a story from Bloomberg that said Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is helping finance AMD’s expansion into AI chips.Microsoft and AMD have teamed to create an alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors for artificial intelligence, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft will provide financial support to bolster AMD’s efforts, as it works with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads.Story continuesThrough it all, InvestingPro shot these updates to subscribers at breakneck speed. Never miss another tech headline again.AMD shares were ultimately off about 1% for the week.Qualcomm's weak guidanceQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares slid after the company forecasted far lower-than-anticipated results for is fiscal third quarter: The company expects 3Q23 EPS in the range of $1.70-$1.90, compared with the consensus of $2.20, and revenue in the range of $8.1-8.9B, compared to the consensus of $9.25B.Q2 earnings of $2.15 per share were in line with expectations.The company said demand for smartphones had deteriorated as China remains weak, calling the macroeconomic environment ""challenging.""Mizuho cut the price target by $10 to $140. As InvestingPro reported in real time, Deutsche Bank cut the company's price target to $130 from the prior $150 while maintaining its Buy rating.Deutsche called the guidance ""disappointing by any measure"" but also believes the company ""should be an attractive beneficiary of the eventual cyclical rebound once one actually occurs (not a matter of if, but rather when).""Shares sank more than 7% for the week.Block's robust Q1Block (NYSE:SQ) shares initially bumped higher after the fintech name reported better-than-expected Q1 results: earnings per share of $0.40 vs. Wall Street's estimate of $0.35, and above-par revenue of $4.99 billion.For the full year, the company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast to $1.36 billion, up from the prior $1.3B.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were both positive on the stock after earnings. JPMorgan sees more room for further upside, calling its operating leverage potential ""underappreciated by the market."" It added, ""SQ remains one of our favorite ideas.""For the week, though, shares slipped 2.5%.Coinbase ekes out a beatCoinbase's Q1 results were better than feared, driven by cost cuts and a jump in subscription revenue: The company lost just $0.34 per share, far better than expectations for $1.39 in the red.After its Thursday report, shares were trading about 9% higher.Looking ahead, the company said it expected subscription and services revenue to fall in the second quarter. For the full year it continues to seek to improve full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollar terms versus full-year 2022.BofA said the results were solid but that big fundamental questions remain unanswered about the company, and maintained its Underperform rating on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): ""We continue to think retail crypto volumes will remain weak and the regulatory overhang will linger for some time,"" the analyst said in a note.Barclays lowered the price target to $61 from $74 per share.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for PulteGroup PulteGroup's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, PulteGroup has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 46%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It's noted that, last year, PulteGroup's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. The good news is that PulteGroup is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.4 percentage points to 21%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of PulteGroup's forecast profits?Are PulteGroup Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of PulteGroup, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$98m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Should You Add PulteGroup To Your Watchlist?PulteGroup's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering PulteGroup for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for PulteGroup (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Although PulteGroup certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

57,db5762f1-306a-348a-a4ac-7d290c5b34ec,WEC,2023-05-08,WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.78,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-nyse-wec-102225860.html,1683541345,STORY,['WEC'],"[WEC Energy Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:WEC) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.78 on 1st of June. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.2%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Based on the last payment, WEC Energy Group's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 24.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 60% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.12. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, WEC Energy Group's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 1.8% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.Story continuesOur Thoughts On WEC Energy Group's DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think WEC Energy Group will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for WEC Energy Group (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing.

Inflation in Canada picked up speed last year, reaching its 40-year high and averaging 6.8%. The Canadian stock market became victim to growing inflation and rising rates as its benchmark index fell by 8.5%, as of December 30, 2022. However, this decline was insignificant in contrast to an 18.1% loss in the S&amp;P 500 last year. The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index is up 5.6% year-to-date.Though the Canadian stock market remained on a strong footing last year compared with its American counterpart, the recent collapse in the banking sector created havoc all over again. According to a report by Financial Post, some of the Canadian top banks’ stocks lost nearly $20 billion in market capitalization following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March. According to analysts, banks with acquisitions in the US could topple in the coming months. In addition to this, analysts are also expecting the Canadian economy to dip this year. In our article 10 High-Growth Canadian Dividend Stocks to Invest In, we mentioned data that suggests that a recession in the US will affect Canadian economic growth for three consecutive quarters, with a 0.9% expected overall contraction.Considering the current market outlook, investors are favoring dividend equities to stay afloat during this period.Dividend investment also involves investing steadily in dividend-focused exchange-traded funds as they hold a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks across different sectors and industries. Moreover, dividend ETFs also offer investors a steady stream of income, which is their main focus in today’s market environment. Danielle LeClair, director of Manager Research for Morningstar Canada, spoke with the financial services company and highlighted the significance of these funds for income investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues“Dividend and income funds have been popular options for Canadian investors because they offer an alternative to traditional fixed income products, which have faced challenges in the lower interest rate environment we have seen the last few years.”Dividend stocks in Canada are also generating positive returns this year. S&amp;P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of Canadian companies that have raised their dividends for at least five years, is up 3.79% year-to-date, as of May 7. In comparison, S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered a 2.35% return to shareholders since the start of the year.While US dividend stocks like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 28% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 7.8% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Johnson &amp; Johnson managed to grow its earnings per share at 60% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Johnson &amp; Johnson's TSR for the last 5 years was 46%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Johnson &amp; Johnson had a tough year, with a total loss of 5.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 0.3%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Johnson &amp; Johnson  that you should be aware of.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America.Over the years, the performance of value and growth stocks has fluctuated as it was influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, market cycles, and investor sentiment. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, value stocks outperformed growth equities during periods of high inflation. The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In our article 13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields, we reported that the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also highlighted analysts’ outlook for value stocks, mentioning that value equities will outperform the market cumulatively by 11.8% over the next three years.When investing in dividend stocks, many investors find undervalued dividend aristocrat stocks appealing because they offer the potential for both income generation and capital appreciation. Moreover, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market during periods of market downturns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same period, as reported by Insider Monkey in 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shareholders have seen the share price rise 54% over three years, well in excess of the market return (37%, not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last 3 years Boeing saw its revenue grow at 0.7% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. In that time the share price is up 15% per year, which is not unreasonable given the revenue gorwth. The real question is when the business will generate profits, and how quickly they will grow. In this sort of situation it can be worth putting the stock on your watchlist. If it can become profitable, then even moderate revenue growth could grow profits quickly.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Boeing will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Boeing has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 49% in the last twelve months. That certainly beats the loss of about 7% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Boeing (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

The Annual Meeting will be held on May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time). Shareholders of record as of close of business on April 3, 2023, are entitled to vote at the meeting, no matter how many or how few shares they own.The full text of the letter follows:VOTE USING THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ILLUMINA'S NINE HIGHLY QUALIFIED DIRECTORSMay 8, 2023Dear Shareholder,You may have been following the news regarding Illumina's upcoming Annual Meeting and investor Carl Icahn's self-serving and deliberately misleading campaign against our company. We are writing today to remind you of our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and the importance of voting the WHITE proxy card FOR all nine of Illumina's director nominees. Your investment in Illumina is at stake.Carl Icahn is attempting to replace our deeply experienced Board nominees John Thompson, Francis deSouza, CEO, and Robert Epstein, MD, with three of his unqualified nominees. Illumina's Board does not endorse Carl Icahn or his unqualified nominees and believes the election of any such nominees would detract from Illumina's core business and deprive the Board of critical leadership and perspective required for the execution of the business. Icahn's nominees bring NO additive skills, NO relevant industry experience, and NO independence from Icahn.Story continuesIllumina's Board of Directors requests that shareholders reject all three of Carl Icahn's nominees by voting the WHITE proxy card today FOR all nine of the company's highly qualified director nominees. The Annual Meeting will be held on May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time). Shareholders of record as of close of business on April 3, 2023, are entitled to vote at the meeting.Illumina leadership team and Board are focused on driving shareholder valueWe are committed to delivering returns to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support of our business and leadership. We are confident in our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value through a balanced investment approach in breakthrough innovations for future growth and improved operating leverage through disciplined expense management. To further our commitment, we outlined a cost reduction plan with our first quarter results.Illumina's Board is independent and brings the right mix of experience in business, healthcare, science and technologyIllumina has a strong position as the global leader in research and clinical genomics, led by its world-class Board members, who bring the highest personal character, integrity, and ethical standards, and reflect a range of professional backgrounds and skills relevant to Illumina's business. The Board is led by an independent chair, John Thompson, and all nine members are independent, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, Francis deSouza. Illumina's Board has been continually refreshed, with seven new directors appointed in the last seven years, and the directors possess the right skill sets and experiences to advance our strategic goals for value creation: seven directors have technology and innovation experience; seven have life sciences experience; and five have financial expertise.Carl Icahn's baseless attacks have targeted three of our deeply experienced Board members. Mr. Thompson has led high-growth companies for more than four decades. He is currently a director at Microsoft and was previously CEO at Symantec, during which he was ranked as one of The Best-Performing CEOs in the World, according to Harvard Business Review in 2010. Mr. deSouza has ten years of experience in the genomics industry and has led our company further into the clinical setting and significantly expanded our commercial footprint. Because of his extensive experience developing and commercializing technologies, establishing industry partnerships and opening new markets, he is uniquely capable of leading Illumina as it innovates for the future. Dr. Epstein brings deep understanding of clinical genomics, experience with pairs and reimbursement and an understanding of the risks and opportunities associated with operating in markets regulated by the FDA and other global regulatory bodies.Mr. Thompson, Mr. deSouza, and Dr. Epstein together have a unique collection of strengths and experience that is critical to our Board, and their leadership and expertise are unnecessarily at risk.Carl Icahn's recently released ""plan"" demonstrates his lack of understanding of both Illumina and the genomics industryCarl Icahn recently released a sloppy and poorly researched letter detailing a so-called ""plan"" for Illumina. What's clear, especially with this most recent ""plan,"" is that Icahn and his team do not understand Illumina's business – neither the business model nor the upfront, multi-year nature of R&amp;D.  As one example, Icahn asks if there is an opportunity to pursue partnerships. In fact, Illumina already has more partnerships than any other organization in genomics. This has long been core to our business strategy and many of these partnerships have been publicly disclosed and details are available in our public filings.Further, Icahn is not a long-term Illumina shareholder – he bought his first share on February 13, 2023, seven days before he requested a questionnaire to nominate directors – and his firm owns less than 1.5% of Illumina's outstanding common shares.He has made it clear that his three director nominees, who are all current or former Icahn employees, would represent his interests on the Board of Illumina and answer to him, not to the shareholders of Illumina. His sole argument rests on the false belief that his nominees will be able to push to divest GRAIL and do it faster than Illumina's Board.His arguments are flawed on multiple levels:Illumina is on the fastest path to maximize value and is committed to concluding the legal process of GRAIL by early 2024.Neither he, nor his nominees, understand the regulatory process of GRAIL, stating that he hasn't ""really studied it.""1Icahn's reckless ""pull the plug"" on GRAIL strategy only guarantees to increase the risk of fines and a suboptimal divestiture process for all shareholders.Illumina leadership under Francis is generating breakthrough products and delivering results even against a challenging backdrop.In the core business, which Mr. Icahn continues to demonstrate he does not understand, Illumina is executing on the right plan to maximize patient impact and shareholder value – with a balanced growth strategy across the business and commitment to higher margins resulting in mid-teens revenue growth and high-teens operating profit growth over time.The truth is that Mr. Icahn is singularly focused on Board seats as a means to advance his own agenda.Mr. Icahn stated plainly that he wanted ""his guys"" – Jesse Lynn, Andrew Teno, and Vincent Intrieri – on the Board precisely because they are not independent, and he controls them. ""My guys answer to me,"" was his curt rationale to explain why a highly qualified independent candidate known to him was unacceptable.2Each of Icahn's nominees confirmed that he did not have any expertise in Illumina's core business. This most recent ""plan"" from Icahn and his team further demonstrates this. None of the Icahn nominees offered any specific recommendations or insights to the Board's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee or any evidence of independence from Mr. Icahn (in fact, they proudly asserted their allegiance to Icahn).To date, Icahn's campaign has employed baseless character assassination and innuendo in place of an actionable alternative to Illumina's plan. There is no substance in his ""plan"" and his uninformed questions serve more to distract from a lack of new ideas than as a coherent alternative to maximize value for Illumina shareholders. Illumina welcomes the opportunity to discuss those questions – or ideally more relevant and forward-looking questions – with our investors.Carl Icahn's real focus has not been on our business but rather on electing all three of his unfit nominees who collectively bring ZERO relevant experience as directors to our Board.The Board does not endorse Carl Icahn or his unqualified nominees and believes the election of any such nominees would detract from Illumina's long-term strategy.Illumina's Board of Directors urges shareholders to protect their investment and reject all three of Carl Icahn's nominees by voting the WHITE proxy card today FOR all nine of the company's highly qualified director nominees. The Annual Meeting will be held virtually on May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time). Shareholders of record as of close of business on April 3, 2023, are entitled to vote at the meeting.The Board does not endorse Carl Icahn or his unqualified nominees and believes the election of any such nominees would detract from Illumina's long-term strategy. Illumina firmly believes that it has the right team and strategy in place to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders.PLEASE VOTE THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAYYour Board recommends that you vote the WHITE proxy card FOR ALL NINE of Illumina's nominees. We urge you NOT to vote using any gold proxy card from Carl Icahn or Icahn Partners LP and certain of its affiliates. Please disregard and discard any gold proxy card.

Use of vepdegestrant in the ongoing and planned clinical trials will continue to monitor and evaluate patient safety and anti-tumor activity.Story continuesIn preclinical studies, vepdegestrant demonstrated up to 97% ER degradation in tumor cells, induced robust tumor shrinkage when dosed as a single agent in multiple ER-driven xenograft models, and showed increased anti-tumor activity when compared to a standard of care agent, fulvestrant, both as a single agent and in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits.About ArvinasArvinas is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies that degrade disease-causing proteins. Arvinas uses its proprietary PROTAC® Discovery Engine platform to engineer proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTAC® targeted protein degraders, that are designed to harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins. In addition to its robust preclinical pipeline of PROTAC® protein degraders against validated and “undruggable” targets, the company has three investigational clinical-stage programs in development: bavdegalutamide and ARV-766 for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; and vepdegestrant (ARV-471) for the treatment of patients with early and locally advanced or metastatic ER positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer.

71,83ee5f76-22af-3022-a46e-12cbff92b574,PFE,2023-05-08,Pfizer's RSV vaccine promise to the Global South is already several years behind schedule,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizers-rsv-vaccine-promise-global-152000716.html,1683472800,STORY,['PFE'],"[A child with RSV in a hospital bedIt took decades, but vaccines for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus that can be serious or deadly in infants and older people, are finally becoming available. On May 3, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Arexvy, the first RSV vaccine for adults aged 60 or older, made by GSK.A second candidate follows closely: Made by Pfizer, it would cover older people and pregnant ones, functioning as a maternal vaccination that would cover children in the first months of life when RSV is most dangerous. The vaccine is expected to be approved in the US by August and become available in Europe a few months after that.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesBut, despite Pfizer’s promises to do better with regard to vaccine equity after covid, it increasingly looks like the vaccine won’t be available in low- and middle-income countries in the near future. The vast majority of the yearly 100,000 to 200,000 global infant deaths due to RSV occur in the Global South, making the virus the second leading cause of deaths in children below five, after malaria. Yet it may take as long as seven years for the maternal vaccines to be available there.Pfizer’s long delayPfizer expects the global market for its RSV vaccine to be about $2 billion. It received a $27.5 million grant from the Gates Foundation to support the vaccine distribution in low- and middle-income countries, for purchase by governments and international organizations.Yet it will likely take years for that to happen. In order to be distributed outside rich countries, the vaccines need adjustments—multi-dose vials, for instance, which are cheaper and more efficient to distribute in areas where transportation may be a challenge. The vials require preservatives, so there is a need for specific trials to ensure efficacy and safety are maintained.Story continuesPfizer, Reuters reports, is only starting to plan for its low-income country distribution now. When contacted by Quartz, the company declined to provide a timeline for making RSV vaccines available in the Global South, but pointed out that it launched a program in August 2022 to make all its vaccines available in 45 lower-income countries on a not-for-profit basis. The program doesn’t have a specific timeline attached to RSV.Too little too lateThe challenges of distribution in lower-income countries are real, but in no way new. Nor are they new for Pfizer. Since 2010, the company has been sitting on the board of the Gavi, the international organization that subsidizes vaccine distribution for low- and middle-income countries, so it is definitely aware of what’s required. Further, Pfizer is currently facing the same hurdles it encountered a decade ago with its pneumococcal vaccine. First approved by the FDA in 2010, the vaccine took several years to be distributed in the Global South. One would hope Pfizer learned lessons about faster vaccine delivery from that process.“They should have started planning this from day one when they thought that vaccine was successful,” says Nina Schwalbe, a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. The high mortality rate of RSV in low-income countries should have made it a priority, she says.Pfizer likely started planning RSV vaccine introduction in the US as soon as the candidate showed promise, and should have done the same when it comes to the Global South, starting trials for multi-dose vials, cold chain stability, and other needs long before it received the Gates Foundation grant, says Schwalbe.“It’s an issue of priorities and incentives within the company about what matters—and what matters is prioritizing profit again,” she says.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of our equity affiliates, and adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements; excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence.The GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represent the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to net income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.Year Ended December 31, 2022Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (in millions)Net income$                       (505)Income tax expense265Interest expense1,117Interest income(389)Depreciation and amortization1,053EBITDA1,541Less: Adjustment for noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries (1)(704)Less: Income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income) and depreciation and amortization from equity affiliates126Interest income recognized under service concession arrangements77Unrealized derivative and equity securities losses131Unrealized foreign currency losses42Disposition/acquisition losses40Impairment losses1,658Loss on extinguishment of debt20Adjusted EBITDA$                     2,931Renewables SBU$                        605Utilities SBU612Energy Infrastructure SBU1,836New Energy Technologies SBU(116)Corporate(6)Adjusted EBITDA$                     2,931 (1)  The allocation of earnings to tax equity investors from both consolidated entities and equity affiliates is removed from Adjusted EBITDA . Year Ended December 31, 20232023 Adjusted EBITDA Modeling Ranges as of 5/8/23Renewables SBU$ 660-730Utilities SBU600-670Energy Infrastructure SBU1,450-1,620New Energy Technologies SBU / Corporate(110)-(120)Adjusted EBITDA$ 2,600-2,900 Adjusted PTC is defined as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence.  Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's U.S. tax return exam.The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.Year Ended December 31, 2020Net of NCI (1)Per Share (Diluted) Net of NCI (1)(in millions, except per share amounts)Income from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to AES and Diluted EPS$                             43$                          0.06Add: Income tax expense from continuing operations attributable to AES130Pre-tax contribution$                           173AdjustmentsUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)$                               3$                          0.01Unrealized foreign currency losses (gains)(10)(0.01)Disposition/acquisition losses1120.17(2)Impairment losses9281.39(3)Loss on extinguishment of debt2230.33(4)Net gains from early contract terminations at Angamos(182)(0.27)(5)U.S. Tax Law Reform Impact0.02(6)Less: Net income tax benefit(0.26)(7)Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS$                        1,247$                          1.44 (1)  NCI is defined as Noncontrolling Interests.(2)  Amount primarily relates to loss on sale of Uruguaiana of $85 million, or $0.13 per share, loss on sale of the Kazakhstan HPPs of $30 million, or $0.05 per share, as a result of the final arbitration decision, and advisor fees associated with the successful acquisition of additional ownership interest in AES Brasil of $9 million, or $0.01 per share; partially offset by gain on sale of OPGC of $23 million, or $0.03 per share.(3)  Amount primarily relates to asset impairments at Gener of $527 million, or $0.79 per share, other-than-temporary impairment of OPGC of $201 million, or $0.30 per share, impairments at our Guacolda and sPower equity affiliates, impacting equity earnings by $85 million, or $0.13 per share, and $57 million, or $0.09 per share, respectively; impairment at Hawaii of $38 million, or $0.06 per share, and impairment at Panama of $15 million, or $0.02 per share.(4)  Amount primarily relates to losses on early retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $146 million, or $0.22 per share, DPL of $32 million, or $0.05 per share, Angamos of $17 million, or $0.02 per share, and Panama of $11 million, or $0.02 per share.(5)  Amounts relate to net gains at Angamos associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence of $110 million, or $0.16 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, and $182 million, or $0.27 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.(6) Amount represents adjustment to tax law reform remeasurement due to incremental deferred taxes related to DPL of $16 million, or $0.02 per share.(7)  Amount primarily relates to income tax benefits associated with the impairments at Gener and Guacolda of $164 million, or $0.25 per share, and income tax benefits associated with losses on early retirement of debt at the Parent Company of $31 million, or $0.05 per share; partially offset by income tax expense related to net gains at Angamos associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence of $49 million, or $0.07 per share. Investor Contact: Susan Harcourt 703-682-1204Media Contact: Amy Ackerman 703-682-6399CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aes-outlines-long-term-strategy-for-growth-in-renewables--us-utilities-while-executing-on-intent-to-exit-coal-by-year-end-2025-301817821.htmlSOURCE The AES Corporation]"

Reported EPS is $0.22 EPS, expectations were $0.23.Operator: Good morning. Thank you for attending today’s The AES Corporation First Quarter 2023 Financial Review. My name is Alicia, and I’ll be your moderator for today’s call. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations with AES Corporation. You may now proceed.Susan Harcourt: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.Andres Gluski: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 financial review call. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year. And today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide key business updates. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give some more detail on our financial performance and outlook. Beginning on Slide 3. As you may have seen in our press release, we introduced new strategic business units, which better reflect the greatly simplified company that AES is today and the pillars of our future growth. We will be giving a broader strategic review at our Investor Day on Monday, including an update on our portfolio transformation and an overview of our strong growth expectations for our renewables and utility businesses.Story continuesOur first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 compared with $0.21 in 2022, which is in line with our expectations. With these results and the underlying performance we are seeing across our business, we are reaffirming our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.75, and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025. Now turning to Slide 4. We continue to see strong demand for renewables both in the U.S. and internationally, including from U.S. corporate customers with operations in international markets. So far this year, we have signed PPAs for 309 megawatts of new renewables, including 154 megawatts of wind with a U.S. technology customer in Brazil. We’re in advanced negotiations for several large additional projects and remain on track to meet our PPA signing target of 14 to 17 gigawatts over the next 3 years.In the U.S., key elements of the inflation Reduction Act or IRA are being clarified. This past month, the Department of Treasury and the IRS release detailed guidance on how clean energy projects located in energy communities can qualify for an additional 10% bonus tax credit. We estimate that approximately 1/3 of our 51 gigawatt pipeline of projects in the U.S. would qualify, which directly translates into a combination of higher potential returns and increased competitiveness for the projects we are developing. We are currently awaiting treasury department guidance on certain provisions of the IRA, including requirements for the clean hydrogen production tax credit. As a reminder, at our green hydrogen project in Texas, the largest advanced green hydrogen project in the U.S., which we are developing jointly with Air Products.We plan to co-locate 1.4 gigawatts of new renewables with the electrolyzers. This means that the projects would have the lowest possible carbon emissions of any known project in the U.S. Additionally, the project is located adjacent to the site of a decommissioned coal plant, which will provide significant existing infrastructure. All of these attributes and the fact that the energy will include hourly matching indicate that the project should qualify for the highest possible tax credit in any scenario. Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts is now around 12 gigawatts. Of which roughly half are already under construction. We continue to maintain a robust supply chain, and we continue to hit our construction milestones without delay.Oil and gas, Industry, EnergyPhoto by Ronan Furuta on UnsplashWe expect to bring online more than 3 gigawatts of new wind, solar and battery storage this year. As we bring projects currently in the backlog online in coming years, we will nearly double our installed renewables capacity, making us one of the fastest-growing renewable companies in the world. Turning to Slide 6. We are also happy to report a positive development at AES Ohio which puts us on track for unprecedented growth in the business. In April, AES Ohio signed a comprehensive settlement agreement for its Electric Security Plan, or ESP 4 which received broad support from residential, commercial, industrial and low-income customers. The settlement included the commission staff as a signatory, and we expect to receive final approval by the end of the third quarter.With ESP 4 in place, along with our existing investment programs, we expect to more than double our rate base by the end of 2027 which would make AES Ohio, one of the fastest-growing utility businesses in the country, while still having the lowest tariffs in the state. Turning to Slide 7. We also reached a major milestone towards exiting coal by the end of 2025. We agreed to terminate the PPA at the Warrior Run plant in Maryland, for which we will receive total payments of $357 million. We will retain control of the site and are exploring new uses that capitalize on its valuable location and existing infrastructure. We see this transaction is very beneficial for all parties involved. Moving to Slide 8. We signed agreements to extend the operations of 1.4 gigawatts of gas generation at our legacy Southland units in California for 3 more years.These plans were previously scheduled to retire at the end of this year. The extensions will lock in additional upside and will help meet the state of California’s grid liability needs while supporting its efforts to transition over time to low carbon source of electricity. The monetization of the contract that Warrior Run and the extension of the legacy Southland units are both good examples of how we are creating value from our existing infrastructure assets during the energy transition. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we will be holding an Investor Day on Monday, where we will be sharing our strategic long-term view of the company, discussing our new business segments and providing long-term growth rates through 2027 for adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and parent free cash flow.With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.Steve Coughlin: Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, 2023 guidance and 2023 parent capital allocation. Turning to Slide 10. As Andres mentioned, in the first quarter, we launched our new Strategic Business Units or SBUs. This new organizational structure reflects AES very focused and simplified portfolio. It also aligns our management teams by business line to maximize our operational synergies and to continue delivering excellent customer experiences across all our markets. Our new SBU reporting segments highlight our rapidly growing renewables and utility businesses and facilitate simplified modeling of AES, which will benefit current and new potential shareholders and analysts.Our new SBUs include renewables, which includes our solar, wind, energy storage and hydro businesses, utilities, which includes AES Indiana, AES Ohio and AES Salvador, Energy infrastructure composed of our thermal generation and LNG infrastructure businesses and new energy technologies, which includes our investments in energy technology businesses such as Fluence and Uplight as well as our green hydrogen business line and future new business innovations which support our mission. In addition to the SBUs, we also have a corporate reporting segment, which includes our corporate G&amp;A our parent level debt and associated interest expense in our captive insurance program called AGC. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.22 versus $0.21 last year.Our business was favorable year-over-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Our results were also impacted by higher parent interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. Now to Slide 12. We are fully on track to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. We expect a significant contribution from new renewables of at least $0.27 this year. This is partially offset by lower contributions from LNG sales, as we have previously mentioned, higher parent interest expense from incremental debt and higher rates on our revolving credit facility and a marginally higher tax rate this year. As is typically the case, our earnings are heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. This year, we expect approximately 3/4 of our earnings to occur in the second half.Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including over 3 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online, which remains solidly on track for completion. We are also reaffirming our expected 7% to 9% average annual growth target through 2025. Turning to Slide 13. As you may have seen in our press release, while we continue to report adjusted EPS, today, we are also introducing adjusted EBITDA as a new reporting metric. As the renewables portion of our business grows at an extremely high rate, we believe adjusted EBITDA is a very informative metric in understanding our business results. First, it aligns well with the performance of our underlying business and operating cash generation. And second, adjusted EBITDA is reported before the impact of U.S. renewables tax attributes so that investors and analysts can separate renewable operating earnings from the very valuable tax incentives for U.S. renewables.Beginning this quarter, I will discuss our new SBU financial results using adjusted EBITDA, with the exception of our utilities SBU, which will be measured using adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, to facilitate comparisons with other utilities. We will provide full year guidance by SBU during our Investor Day on Monday. Adjusted EBITDA was $628 million this quarter versus $621 million in the prior year. This was driven by higher first quarter LNG sales and growth in renewables, but was partially offset by the impact of warmer than normal weather at our U.S. utilities. I’ll cover the performance of our new SBUs in the next 4 slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 14. Higher EBITDA was driven primarily by a higher level of generation at our facilities in Panama higher wind generation and contributions from new businesses.This was partially offset by higher spend as we continue to ramp up our renewables development and lower power prices impacting our Bulgaria wind facility. Lower PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by warmer-than-normal winter weather and higher interest expense, but partially offset by higher revenues as a result of our continued investment in the rate base. Higher EBITDA and our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects higher LNG sales, partially offset by lower margins from coal PPAs, the retirement of our coal plant in Hawaii last year and lower availability at Southland Energy. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects a significant improvement in operations and gross margins at Fluence. Now to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 18.Sources reflect approximately $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion of total discretionary cash, including $950 million to $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of proceeds from asset sales and $700 million to $1 billion of planned parent debt issuance. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return nearly $500 million to shareholders this year. This consists of our common share dividend, including the previously announced 5% increase as well as the coupon on the equity units. We plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion toward new growth, of which the majority will go to renewables and utilities. In summary, we’ve made great progress on our financial commitments for the year. At our Investor Day on Monday, we will provide detail on the strategy and future of AES overall and for each of our new SBUs. We will also provide long-term growth rates through 2027 for adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and parent free cash flow.I look forward to talking with many of you then. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Andres.Andres Gluski: Thank you, Steve. In summary, we are pleased with our progress to date and remain on track to hit our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025. We continue to see strong demand for renewables and especially from our corporate customers. Our supply chain is robust and our construction projects are progressing as planned. We’re also encouraged by the settlement agreement at AS Ohio, which paves the way for final approval of our new electric security plan later this year and creates the framework for significant investments in the utility. Finally, we see our successful negotiations to terminate the Warrior Run contract and extend the operations of the 1.4 gigawatts of our legacy South line units as indicative of the success we are having in maximizing shareholder value from our existing assets as we transform the portfolio.We look forward to providing a broader strategic update at our Investor Day on Monday, including more details around our growth plans and guidance through 2027. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions.See also 20 Biggest Holding Companies in USA and 20 Most Desirable Companies To Work For In USA.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

There's just too much uncertainty in the sector.""You will see a change in the vehicles, but you won't see anyone that owns the market because they changed the vehicles,"" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual meeting.In recent years, Tesla (TSLA) has dominated the US market for EVs. While Tesla still has a strong hold on the market with 54.3% market share, legacy automakers such as General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) have gradually started adding market share as well.The competition has intensified as traditional automakers and new startups spend billions on EV production, securing supply chains, and infrastructure. Automakers including Tesla have signaled they are willing to suffer lower margins through price cuts as they vie for market leadership.Buffett alluded to Ford as a cautionary tale of how unsteady the auto industry can be: ""Henry Ford looked like he owned the world with the Model T ... and 20 years later they were losing money,"" he said.Berkshire Hathaway does own a dealership group with over 100 franchises representing 27 automakers across 10 states, mainly in Texas and Arizona. The conglomerate, which also owns railroad BNSF, purchased the dealership chain Van Tuyl Group in 2014.Berkshire also owns roughly 50 million shares in General Motors, worth $1.68 billion as of Dec. 2022, but sold some of its GM stock in the second and third quarters of 2022.But Buffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger said they didn't have an interest in venturing further into the auto business.""Charlie [Munger] and I long have felt that the auto industry is just too tough,"" Buffett said. ""It’s just a business where you’ve got a lot of worldwide competitors, they're not going to go away, and it looks like there are winners at any given time, but it doesn’t get you a permanent place.""Story continuesBerkshire Hathway CEO Warren Buffett answers questions at the annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Neb. on May 6, 2023. (Screenshot/CNBC)Munger agreed, adding that although EVs are certainly on the rise, that uptick comes with some significant costs.""The electric vehicle is coming big time, and that’s a very interesting development,"" Munger said. ""At the moment, it's imposing huge capital costs and huge risks, and I don't like huge capital costs and huge risks.""It's better to identify opportunities with more certainty, Buffett explained.""I think I know where Apple’s going to be in 5 or 10 years,"" he said, ""and I don't know what the car companies are going to be in 5 or 10 years.""More Yahoo Finance coverage of Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual meeting:Berkshire Hathaway 2023: Warren Buffett says managers were 'surprised' by the economyBuffett: 'Catastrophic' to let SVB depositors lose their moneyCharlie Munger on AI: 'I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well'Warren Buffett on investing: 'Be a no-emotion person' in matters of businessBuffett: Taiwan Semiconductor is 'one of the best-managed' and most important companies in the worldWarren Buffett: 'Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio'Warren Buffett sticks with Bank of America as crisis rocks bank stocksBuffett: The biggest investing opportunities are 'other people doing dumb things'Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Start your 7-day trial today.U.S. hesitates to add EVs to renewable fuel programChatter spread Monday morning that the U.S. government might be putting the brakes on handing out tradable credits to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers under a renewable fuel scheme, per reports that cited unnamed sources. According to the sources, supporters of the plan are pushing pause as they are worried about potential legal challenges.The plan would give EV automakers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) credits for charging vehicles using power generated from renewable natural gas, or methane.The EPA recommended adding EVs to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) last year and said it was considering public comments on the proposed change, but would not comment further on whether it would split out EVs from the mandate.Tesla hikes prices in key marketsTesla made headlines this week by unexpectedly increasing the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the United States, China, Japan, and Canada. This price hike comes as a surprise, as it is the first time Tesla has raised the price of the Model 3 since January, after several price cuts earlier in the year.But they didn’t stop there. Tesla also raised the prices of its Model S and Model X vehicles in China, according to its website on Friday. The company appears to be maintaining a higher price point for these models in China, positioning them in the premium segment of the country's electric car market.Despite the changes this week, Tesla vehicles are still priced lower than they were at the beginning of the year.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.Story continuesTSLA shares added 5.4% this week.Ford fights to compete, slashes prices on Mach-ERival automaker Ford (NYSE:F) followed Tesla’s unexpected price hikes by slashing the prices of its Mustang Mach-E on Tuesday. Ford said it would be reducing most Mach-E prices by $3,000 to $4,000, depending on the specific version.But Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed concern about the ongoing EV price war the very next day, calling it a ""worrying trend."" He drew comparisons to Henry Ford's series of price cuts for the Model T in 1913, which eventually put the company's future in jeopardy.Despite these concerns, Farley said Ford would face Tesla head on and cut prices on models such as the Mustang Mach-E, which directly competes with Tesla's Model Y. It remains to be seen how this price war will play out and impact both companies in the long run.Farley added: ""There’s a limit to how far we’ll go.""GM’s bumpy week: Job cuts and a guilty pleaGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) started the week off with a cost-cutting move, reportedly letting go of several hundred full-time contract workers over the weekend. This move is part of the company's larger goal to reduce its budget by $2 billion by the end of next year.These job cuts come on the heels of a voluntary separation package offered to 5,000 salaried employees about a month ago. GM claimed the voluntary program would help it achieve close to 50% of its cost-cutting goal, and that no further involuntary cuts would be necessary.Unfortunately, things did not improve for General Motors over the course of the week. Reports emerged that the company had pleaded guilty in a worker safety case related to the death of an employee at its St. Catharines facility in Canada.The company was fined $325,000. The court also imposed a 25% victim fine surcharge, as required by the Provincial Offences Act, which will be credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.This was the second injury at the Canadian plant this year.Shares of GM ended trading at $33.26, a 5% rebound off their weekly low achieved on Thursday.Fisker special deliveryFisker (NYSE:FSR) ended its week on a high note as the American automaker announced Friday that it had delivered the first brand-new Fisker Ocean all-electric SUV to a customer in Denmark.

80,72280244-4ae4-3ca1-87a8-d433f1c823f5,GM,2023-05-08,3 Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to New Heights in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-soar-heights-114338081.html,1683200618,STORY,"['V', 'AAPL', 'GM']","[It is not easy to pick stocks for tomorrow’s success but some companies do have certain elements that make them clear winners and ideal stocks to buy, no matter the market situation. We have had a mixed earnings season. While the future looks promising, there is still a lot of uncertainty due to the recent interest rate hike and looming recession concerns. However, we try to look for companies that look promising in 2023 and are ready to spur a new phase of growth. Watch out for these stocks to ensure that you make the most of the gains they post when the market improves. Having reported strong quarterly results, these are three stocks to buy before they soar to new heights this year. Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comThere are several reasons I think Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks and could be a long-term winner. The company already has a tremendous history of success and has produced exceptional results in the last five years. I believe Visa is at a stage where it can take risks and hit record revenues. The company has seen a massive net income margin going from 36% in 2017 to 51% in 2022. More importantly, its total payment volume went from $10.2 trillion in 2017 to $14.1 trillion in 2022. V stock is trading at $225.98 today and is up 8.97% year-to-date. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe company recently reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It earned $2.09 a share and hit a revenue of $7.98 billion. Visa has seen an increase in digital payments and the post-pandemic rise in travel has led to solid earnings and sales growth. Its payment volume grew 10% year-over-year and services revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Considering the volatility of banks today, consumers see Visa as a very secure alternative. It has a dividend yield of 0.80% and the current dividend is $0.40. It ended the March quarter with $13.8 billion in cash. Visa is spearheading the transition towards a cashless society. While it may take some time for many countries to go digital, there is a massive growth opportunity lying ahead. Story continuesBarclay analyst Ramsey El-Assal has a price target of $272 for the stock with an Overweight rating. Further, Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey has also raised the price target to $270 with a buy rating after the robust Q2. Looking at the company’s fundamentals and valuation, it is ready to skyrocket in the near term. This is a world-class business you are getting at a fair valuation. Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockConsidering its past performance and growing market capitalization, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could soon become one of the biggest tech stocks to own. Besides being a high dividend growth stock, it is also one stock that continues to perform, no matter the market condition. The company is constantly expanding with innovation and has reported healthy earnings in the past. One of the high growth stocks, AAPL is trading for $167 today and is up 33.89% year to date. Apple is one of the best stocks to buy before the company reports earnings on May 4. The company has entered the financial service segment with the new high-yield savings account in partnership with Goldman Sachs. This project it has attracted $1 billion in deposits in just 4 days. AAPL stock pays a dividend of 92 cents and has enough cash flow to continue rewarding investors. It is a cash flow machine and generates impressive free cash flow each year. The company has recently opened two new stores in India and is shifting its focus there due to the massive middle-class segment. India is one of the most populous nations in the world and Apple already generates $6 billion in annual revenue in the country. The company is expecting to grow annual sales t0 $20 billion and grab a larger market share by 2025 in India. Additionally, its services segment has shown impressive growth potential and I believe it will rake in big numbers this quarter as well. Apple’s massive growth in the market is here to stay and the stock could hit big numbers this year. General Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comElectric cars are everywhere and we are constantly hearing about EV incentives. General Motors (NYSE:GM) may not be an EV leader, it sure is growing on the right track. The company has the advantage of owning some of the top brands and it is aggressively charging forward in the EV space. It may not be as big as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) yet but this doesn’t mean the company isn’t doing well. It is planning to transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs through 2035. GM stock is trading at $32.48 today and is down 16.72% in the past six months. This is an ideal buying opportunity for one of the top soaring stocks. GM’s solid financials make it one of the best stocks to buy. It reported an EPS of $2.21 and a revenue of $39.99 billion. The management raised adjusted earnings expectations to a range of $11 to $13 billion. To achieve its production goals, the company, with South Korea-based Samsung SDI plans to invest $3 billion to build a new battery cell manufacturing plant. General Motors will see three models that qualify for the full $7,500 in credit and this will lead to a higher demand for GM EVs this year. It aims to produce 1 million vehicles by 2025 and this number might look ambitious but the company does have a lot laid out. It has a solid balance sheet to support this goal and $24 billion in cash on hand. On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These are the stocks of consumer goods companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Of course, the fact that these companies have managed to raise their payouts for so many years shows that they are both very well-managed and at least somewhat resistant to recessions. So these reliable consumer-goods stocks are also very good names to buy for those investors who (unlike me) believe that a recession is beginning or will kick off soon.Also noteworthy is that I believe that all three of these consumer stocks are undervalued at this point.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTarget (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) has raised its dividend for an incredible 51 consecutive years and currently has a significant dividend yield of 2.8%.Although Target is not a consumer goods company in the traditional sense, it does, of course, sell a tremendous number of consumer goods. So those looking for a company that specializes in consumer goods can and should consider buying TGT stock.In recent quarters, Target has had trouble managing its inventories as supply chains improved and consumers started spending more of their funds on experiences than usual, causing them to reduce their purchases of goods.But the retailer is making significant progress in lowering its inventory levels, and I have theorized that at some point this year, consumer spending on goods will normalize. Supporting my thesis, research firm Canalys expects smartphone sales to climb during the remainder of 2023.Moreover, Target is expected to benefit from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s bankruptcy.Target’s enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.87x is attractive, and its enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 14.4x is also alluring, making it one of the best undervalued consumer goods stocks to buy.Story continuesBrown-Forman (BF-B)Person holding cellphone with logo of American spirits company Brown-Forman (BF-B) Corporation on screen in front of webpage.

83,d30ae048-171e-368e-a743-96d6fcc76bac,TGT,2023-05-08,Can Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporations-nyse-tgt-roe-110040900.html,1683543640,STORY,['TGT'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Target How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:25% = US$2.8b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.25 in profit.Does Target Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Target has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Consumer Retailing industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 5 risks we have identified for Target.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesTarget's Debt And Its 25% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Target, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.26. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Target may not be the best stock to buy.

Strong pricing drove 1% sales growth in the corrugated packaging segment and 7% growth in the consumer packaging segment, but sales in the global paper segment declined 17% in the quarter due to weak export demand for containerboard. Consolidated EBITDA was down 4% for the quarter, impacted by weakness in the global paper segment and economic downtime taken throughout the mill system. WestRock ended its first fiscal quarter with net debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.35x, slightly above its targeted range of 1.75-2.25x, driven primarily by the acquisition of the remaining interest in Grupo Gondi. While macroeconomic weakness continues to weigh on demand for packaging, we believe WestRock operates a resilient business model with exposure to a diverse range of end markets. The business has generated over $1 billion in free cash flow in each of the last seven years, and we believe they will exceed that level again during fiscal 2023.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Analog Devices with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices Analog Devices' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. It certainly is nice to see that Analog Devices has managed to grow EPS by 27% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Analog Devices shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 28% to 34% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Analog Devices' forecast profits?Are Analog Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Analog Devices, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$326m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Analog Devices Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Analog Devices' strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Analog Devices that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

We have had a mixed earnings season. While the future looks promising, there is still a lot of uncertainty due to the recent interest rate hike and looming recession concerns. However, we try to look for companies that look promising in 2023 and are ready to spur a new phase of growth. Watch out for these stocks to ensure that you make the most of the gains they post when the market improves. Having reported strong quarterly results, these are three stocks to buy before they soar to new heights this year. Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comThere are several reasons I think Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks and could be a long-term winner. The company already has a tremendous history of success and has produced exceptional results in the last five years. I believe Visa is at a stage where it can take risks and hit record revenues. The company has seen a massive net income margin going from 36% in 2017 to 51% in 2022. More importantly, its total payment volume went from $10.2 trillion in 2017 to $14.1 trillion in 2022. V stock is trading at $225.98 today and is up 8.97% year-to-date. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe company recently reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It earned $2.09 a share and hit a revenue of $7.98 billion. Visa has seen an increase in digital payments and the post-pandemic rise in travel has led to solid earnings and sales growth.

The dividend yield is 1.1% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. View our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, Amphenol's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 12.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 26% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.105 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 23% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Amphenol has grown earnings per share at 23% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like Amphenol's DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

92,58bd0ab5-6d5f-3b99-a231-1c643cf81c33,NVDA,2023-05-08,Institutional investors have a lot riding on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 66% ownership,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-nvidia-140014996.html,1683468014,STORY,['NVDA'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 66% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$23b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 54% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NVIDIA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$28b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - NVIDIA has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America.Over the years, the performance of value and growth stocks has fluctuated as it was influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, market cycles, and investor sentiment. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, value stocks outperformed growth equities during periods of high inflation. The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In our article 13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields, we reported that the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also highlighted analysts’ outlook for value stocks, mentioning that value equities will outperform the market cumulatively by 11.8% over the next three years.When investing in dividend stocks, many investors find undervalued dividend aristocrat stocks appealing because they offer the potential for both income generation and capital appreciation. Moreover, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market during periods of market downturns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same period, as reported by Insider Monkey in 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.

Prices are set to rise 0.4% on a month-over-month basis.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the food and energy prices, inflation is forecast to rise 5.5% over last year in April, a slowdown from the 5.6% increase seen in March. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.4%.On Tuesday, President Biden is expected to meet with the Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and other top congressional leaders as worries intensify that the U.S. will default on its date as early as June 1. Historically, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling has weighed on stocks.Elsewhere in Washington, a hearing entitled ""Federal Responses to Recent Bank Failure"" is expected for Wednesday. The hearing comes as pressure mounts on several regional banks that have seen their stock price deteriorate and are reportedly looking for buyers.Disney will headline another busy week of corporate earnings with Airbnb (ABNB), Rivian (RIVN), and Warren Buffett favorite Occidental Petroleum (OXY) all set to report.A rally led by strong earnings from Apple pushed the Nasdaq (^IXIC) more than two percent higher on Friday and put the tech index on even footing for the week.This rally, however, wasn't enough to push the major indexes higher for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) both falling after the Federal Reserve raised rates last week in what Wall Street called a ""hawkish pause"" that left open the possibility of more rate hikes.Story continuesThis week's data on consumer and producer prices comes on the heels of Friday's April jobs report which showed the US labor market remaining more resilient than expected in the face of aggressive rate hikes from the Fed.Downward revisions in Friday's report which showed 149,000 fewer jobs were created in February and March than had been previously reported tempered some optimism about the labor market. In an email on Friday, BlackRock's Rick Rieder called the report ""mixed"" and said the data was ""consistent with a slowing labor market in the most cyclical areas, but not a weak one overall.""On the inflation side, economists at Wells Fargo said in a note last week higher gas prices likely drove the expected monthly growth in headline CPI for April, but said a slowdown in the economy will likely continue to push overall price increases lower.""As we have been saying for some time now, we expect that slowing economic activity will trigger a material deceleration in inflation, but the path back to 2% will be long and bumpy,"" the firm wrote in a note on Friday.Democrats and Republicans sit at a standstill over the debt limit ahead of Biden's meeting with congressional leaders. Markets have recently become focused on the so-called ""X-date"" when the US could default on its debt.In a note to clients last week, strategist on Bank of America's global rates and currencies team said this data likely stands at June 1, in-line with projections from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. And this date keeps the most acute market reaction still about a week away, in BofA's view.""Prior debt limit episodes imply that broader markets don't seem to price in debt limit scenarios until two weeks before the projected X date,"" the firm wrote. ""We expect this [debt limit] resolution will likely go down to the wire which means risk of higher rate &amp; broad market volatility in late May or early June.""U.S. President Joe Biden speaks with members of his ""Investing in America Cabinet"" in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 5, 2023.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For instance the ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) share price is 106% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. It's down 1.3% in the last seven days.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for ONEOK While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, ONEOK achieved compound earnings per share growth of 40% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 27% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on ONEOK's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for ONEOK the TSR over the last 3 years was 158%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that ONEOK shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 7% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand ONEOK better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for ONEOK  you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

(NASDAQ:XRAY)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-dentsply-sirona-inc-135728635.html,1683467848,STORY,['XRAY'],"[DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (NASDAQ:XRAY), is not the largest company out there, but it led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at DENTSPLY SIRONA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA Is DENTSPLY SIRONA Still Cheap?Great news for investors – DENTSPLY SIRONA is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $59.90, but it is currently trading at US$41.30 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that DENTSPLY SIRONA’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.Can we expect growth from DENTSPLY SIRONA?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 5.2% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for DENTSPLY SIRONA, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since XRAY is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on XRAY for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy XRAY. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing DENTSPLY SIRONA at this point in time.

107,6878dbbc-b7f3-3b5b-af03-33257aecb4ee,ORCL,2023-05-08,3 Tech Titans Set to Break Out,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-titans-set-break-055105557.html,1683525065,STORY,"['ORCL', '^GSPC', 'GOOGL', 'CRM']","[Tech Stocks Climb the Wall of WorryFrom a macro perspective, investors have deep-rooted concerns about the current stock market, including a potential looming recession, stubborn inflation, a debt crisis, geopolitical escalations, and more. Small-cap stocks within the Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM) have dragged as regional banking stocks within the SPDR Regional Bank ETF (KRE) continue to struggle.  However, despite the fear-mongering from many investors and the underperformance in some regions of the market, tech has marched higher in a stair-stepping fashion thus far in 2023. Currently, it is in the process of breaking out.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite a rough period of outperformance in 2022, it’s easy to see why investors are anxious to get exposure to the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). Over the past 20 years, the returns have been stellar from both a total return and a relative basis. Since 2003, the QQQ has returned 982.8% versus just 541.5% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThough tech has dominated in 2023, not all tech stocks are created equally. For example, former high-flying, lesser-quality tech stocks such as Block (SQ) and Zoom (ZM) are still stuck in downtrends. Conversely, stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have performed so well that they now account for nearly 14% of the S&amp;P 500 Index – the highest weighting for two companies in at least 40 years. So, it’s clear - investors are gravitating toward large-cap, institutional quality stocks with loads of cash.While stocks like AAPL, MSFT, and Shopify (SHOP) have performed well, new buyers looking to enter tech need to be strategic and not chase stretched charts. Below are three high-quality tech stocks setting up:My first pick is Alphabet (GOOGL). One of my favorite indications that a position will move higher occurs when a stock can shake off bad news quickly. My thinking is that if bad news is no news, no news should equate to good news.Story continuesIn early February, GOOGL shares tanked more than 10% after its AI chatbot Bard, made a mistake in its public-facing demo. While it was not a good look for the company or the stock, bargain hunters used the sell-off as an opportunity to accumulate shares. Last week, in a show of conviction, insiders scooped up a cool $20 million worth of the company’s stock. GOOGL is a mega-cap tech name that will essentially track the Q’s but should outperform to the upside over the next 6-12 months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMy next choice is Oracle (ORCL). Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft or Amazon Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the combination that makes for an excellent addition to any portfolio. Last week, Oracle broke out of a classic bull flag pattern on expanding volume.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhen discussing dominance and quality in the software space, it is impossible to leave out Salesforce (CRM). Salesforce is the world’s leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company. Though CRM’s earnings growth slowed briefly during the uncertainty of the pandemic, the company is beginning to reap the benefits of its recent acquisition spree. Over the past few years, CRM has acquired Microsoft Teams competitor Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, and Mulesoft. Furthermore, key strategic partnership agreements with Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN) have helped the company to bolster growth. Last quarter, earnings growth rocketed by 100% year-over-year.Beyond a resumption of strong growth, CRM is very attractive from a valuation perspective. CRM’s P/E ratio of ~37 is the lowest in at least ten years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnically, the stock is consolidating in a bullish manner as it approaches its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out earlier this year. The first pullback to the 50-day moving average should offer investors a low-risk entry point and give them a chance to gain a cushion in the stock before it reports earnings at the end of the month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

109,0e7c0bca-695d-3b20-9aab-1ad7bbb8e4a5,FIS,2023-05-08,Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At $0.52,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fidelity-national-information-services-nyse-121217652.html,1683461537,STORY,['FIS'],"[The board of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.52 on the 23rd of June, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This will take the annual payment to 3.7% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Fidelity National Information Services' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. While Fidelity National Information Services is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 129.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 26%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendFidelity National Information Services Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.08. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. Fidelity National Information Services' earnings per share has shrunk at 85% a year over the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesIn SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Fidelity National Information Services' payments are rock solid. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

For more jobs, head on over to 5 Part Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience Required. The U.S. labor market has been at the center of debate for the past couple of months. This is due to the economic overheating in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight the aftermath. While economic growth is generally viewed positively, too much growth is also a bad thing since it leaves excessive cash flowing in the market which then results in inflation. So, during macroeconomic growth, firms see their businesses boom and end up hiring more people. This creates a scarcity in the labor market, and to compete for employees, the pay offered to them rises. This, in turn, leaves more disposable income for spending, which then ends up increasing the demand for goods, products, and services. This higher demand ends up straining manufacturing capacity, causing firms to raise their production costs and then by extension, prices.America, like other countries of the developed world, also sees teenagers start working while they're not at school or during summer break. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are 5.6 million teenagers (aged 16 to 19 years) employed in America. They are concentrated primarily in the retail trade and leisure and hospitality industry. Within the retail sector, out of the total 16 million people employed, this age group accounts for 1.3 million or nearly ten percent of the workforce. In the retail sector, the workers are employed primarily in warehouses, supercenters, general stores, and supermarkets (such as those operated by Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)). In the leisure and hospitality industry, teenagers account for a greater proportion of the workforce. According to the data, after employees aged between 25 and 34 years (2.9 million), the teenage group was the largest constituent of this industry since out of the total 13.7 million people employed, 2.3 million were 16 to 19 year olds. Within the hospitality sector, fast food restaurants (such as those operated by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)) were by far the largest employers of teenagers, as they employed 1.9 million out of the total 2.3 million.Story continuesNaturally, since these two industries are the largest employers for teenagers, it's relevant to take a look at what the future might hold for them. The Labor Department classifies Fast Food and Counter workers as part of the broader Food and Beverage Serving and Related Workers segment. According to its statistics, there were 4.1 million people employed in this category as of 2021. Apart from fast food counter workers, who take orders and deal with customers, other roles in this segment include waiters and servers. The median hourly wage for this category was $12.49 in 2021, with Fast Food and Counter workers making slightly lesser $12.07 per hour. Within the broader category, the top ten percent made more than $16.40 per hour while the bottom ten percent made less than $8.80. The Labor Department further estimates that jobs in the food and beverage serving and related roles will grow at 9% between 2021 and 2031 - which is faster than the 5% growth for all jobs in the U.S. as a whole.Moving toward the retail industry, the outlook is less rosy. Estimates show that from employing 15.3 million people in 2021, the Retail trade industry will see employees leave with the total number of workers estimated to sit at 15 million by 2031 end. In percentage terms, this represents a 0.2% drop in compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) terms until 2031. This is in opposition to the 0.5% growth that was recorded during the ten years between 2011 and 2021.As a whole, non-farm employment in America remained strong during March 2023. A total of 236,000 new jobs were added, with the unemployment rate sitting at a flat 3.5%. The new job addition was also driven by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added the highest amount of jobs, or 72,000 jobs out of the total 236,000 additions. However, the market is slowing down, as the latest additions were lower than the six month average of 95,000 new jobs. Within this industry, the food services and bars segment was the largest contributor, as it accounted for 50,000 of the total 72,000 new additions.Since the leisure and hospitality industry is both a significant employer of teenagers and a strong contributor to overall employment in America, it's also important to take a broad look at the industry's economic prospects. On this front, a research report from Facts and Factors believes that the hospitality industry will grow at a 10.24% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. This will enable it to grow from an estimated value of $3.9 trillion at the start of the forecast period to $6.7 trillion by its end. Astute readers will also note that the 10.24% CAGR is also in the same range as the job growth of 9% in the leisure and hospitality industry as mentioned above and predicted by the Labor Department.Finally, looking at the near term sales and trends in the retail industry, executives of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shared important details for them during the firm's fourth quarter of 2023 earnings call. During the event, they outlined:Walmart U.S. comps increased 8.3%, including 17% growth in e-commerce with a combination of pricing due in part to inflation and share gains. Sam’s Club U.S. delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 12.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco. And constant currency sales in Walmart International increased 5.5%, led by Walmex. As I discuss our profitability, it’s important to note the reorganization and restructuring charges within the International segment affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q4 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items. Gross margins were down 83 basis points, largely resulting from additional markdowns taken to address carryover inventory balances, mix headwinds and underlying inflation in our cost structure.On the near term outlook:We currently expect sales growth to be strongest in the first half then moderating in the second half, reflecting our macro assumptions and a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Because we will lap the benefit we received last year from insurance proceeds in 2Q, we expect operating income to be flat in 2Q relative to last year. We expect operating income growth to begin to outpace sales growth to a greater degree in the second half of the year versus the first half. In closing, I want to echo Doug’s Sentiment on our business. Over the last year, our team responded to some of the external challenges with the speed and nimbleness rarely seen in a company of our size and we exited the year in a much, much better place. As I reflect on where we are today, I’m more excited about our future than at any point in my time here.With these details in mind, let's take a look at part time jobs for 18 year olds with no experience required.Part Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience RequiredOur MethodologyTo compile our list, we consulted three reliable sources (1,2,3) for jobs for 18 year olds without any experience. First, all the positions were listed, then their hourly rates were noted down. They were then scanned for roles that can be taken part time. The list is divided into three categories.

This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 45.8%.

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.40.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America.Over the years, the performance of value and growth stocks has fluctuated as it was influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, market cycles, and investor sentiment. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, value stocks outperformed growth equities during periods of high inflation. The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In our article 13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields, we reported that the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year. The report also highlighted analysts’ outlook for value stocks, mentioning that value equities will outperform the market cumulatively by 11.8% over the next three years.When investing in dividend stocks, many investors find undervalued dividend aristocrat stocks appealing because they offer the potential for both income generation and capital appreciation. Moreover, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market during periods of market downturns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same period, as reported by Insider Monkey in 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Capital One Financial's shares before the 12th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.40 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Capital One Financial has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current share price of $88.01. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Capital One Financial is paying out just 16% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Capital One Financial's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 31% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Capital One Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 28% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpIs Capital One Financial worth buying for its dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. In summary, Capital One Financial appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Capital One Financial is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Capital One Financial you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The good news for investors is that there have never been more options available when it comes to making socially responsible capital allocations. For those on the hunt for sustainable investing stocks to buy, many successful and profitable companies are tackling climate change and seeking to improve their impact on the environment.Investors looking for peace of mind that their investments are serving a greater good are able to cast a wide net. That’s because a growing number of companies in the U.S. and abroad are taking the principles of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) seriously, and integrating it into their business practices with the understanding that it will be reflected in their share price.Here are three sustainable investing stocks to buy for socially responsible gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGEGeneral Electric$101.77FFord Motor$11.79ALBAlbemarle$172.91General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comLargely known for making aircraft engines, industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) isn’t the first name that comes to mind when talking about sustainable investments. However, the company is pushing further into renewable energy, namely with GE Vernova, a division that focuses almost exclusively on renewable power. Specifically, GE Vernova develops wind turbines, hydropower generation and energy storage solutions.The Vernova unit is being spun off by GE as part of the company’s plan to divide itself into three companies that will focus on aviation, healthcare and renewable energy. GE Vernova is currently posting losses but is expected to be profitable in 2024. The Vernova business is also expected to benefit from the $4.5 billion the Biden administration plans to spend on climate change initiatives.Owing largely to its spin-off plans, GE stock has gained 73% in the past 12 months, including a 56% increase this year.Story continuesFord Motor (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAfter decades of burning fossil fuels and exuding emissions, the automotive industry is going green with electric vehicles (EVs). Leading the charge in America is Ford Motor (NYSE:F), which is spending more than $50 billion in an effort to produce 2 million electric vehicles a year by the end of 2026. Investments made as part of the automaker’s growth plan include the development of a new mega campus in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.While Ford isn’t the only vehicle manufacturer that is shifting its fleet to more environmentally sustainable EVs, it is spending more money than most of its competitors and operating on an accelerated timetable. It’s all part of Ford’s efforts to supplant rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the top producer of electric vehicles in America.Investors may also like that F stock is trading at just 7.3 times forward earnings, below its five-year average, after declining 17% over the past 12 months.

A chemical manufacturer, Albemarle has proven to be a key player in the automotive and battery industries, supplying much of the lithium that is helping society transition away from burning fossil fuels.As might be expected, ALB stock has been on an upswing as demand for lithium skyrocketed. Rising demand led to a spike in the price of lithium in recent years, although prices have softened.Over the past five years, ALB stock has gained 78%. In the past 12 months, however, the company’s share price has come down 10%. This is mainly due to shifting demand in China, where the country’s electric vehicle production has been repeatedly interrupted due to Covid-19 lockdowns. Demand in China and elsewhere is forecast to pick up as we firmly put the pandemic in our rearview mirror, which is good news for Albemarle’s future outlook.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Early last month, the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — shocked the market with unexpected production cuts. Essentially, the decision sent the message that foreign entities can influence the dollar’s trajectory.Considering that these oil-rich countries don’t always have our best interests in mind, it’s always possible that another energy shock can disrupt global affairs. As well, normalization trends from the Covid-19 crisis may help organically boost demand. Notably, vehicle miles traveled have steadily moved higher since the pandemic lull, boding cynically well for cheap energy stocks. However, many energy players can still be had for a discount. Thus, astute buyers may want to check out these ideas for undervalued energy stocks 2023.EPMEvolution Petroleum$6.28MGYMagnolia Oil &amp; Gas$19.90PSXPhillips 66$97.07VLOValero Energy$107.49ERFEnerplus$13.99DINOHF Sinclair$41.93PBFPBF.

Nevertheless, EPM could rank among the best undervalued energy stocks to buy.According to investment resource Gurufocus, Evolution rates as a significantly undervalued enterprise. By the numbers, EPM trades at a trailing multiple of 5.09. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 65.82% of the competition. Also, EPM trades at 2.99-times operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat pings at 4.5 times.Story continuesAdditionally, Evolution benefits from myriad other financial strengths. Aside from a cash-rich balance sheet, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at an impressive 35.9%. Also, its trailing-year net margin smokes the competition of cheap energy stocks at 29.52%.Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (MGY)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockFeaturing extensive acumen in the exploration and production industry, Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (NYSE:MGY) operates in South Texas. Carrying a market capitalization of $4.27 billion, Magnolia slides nicely among the mid-cap undervalued energy stocks to buy. However, MGY will require some patience, with shares stumbling 10% since the beginning of this year.Still, the red ink in the charts presents a possible fundamental discount. Right now, MGY trades at a multiple of 4.24. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than 71.34% of companies listed in the oil and gas industry. Also, MGY trades at 4.49-times free cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is a loftier 7.07 times. As with Evolution Petroleum, Magnolia also enjoys other financial strengths.

As a discount to earnings, Phillips 66 ranks better than 72.39% of its oil and gas peers. Also, PSX trades at 0.27-times trialing sales.

Their average price target lands at $126.78, implying nearly 34% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth consideration for undervalued energy stocks 2023.Valero Energy (VLO)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAnother downstream petroleum specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) deserves a closer look as a candidate for cheap energy stocks. According to Zacks Equity Research, Valero beat its first-quarter earnings target on higher refinery throughput. Despite the positive news, the market has a dour outlook for VLO, sending shares down nearly 8% for the year. This might be a mistake.Right now, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 3.15. Even more impressive, VLO trades at a forward multiple of 5.11. As a discount to projected earnings, Valero ranks better than 72.42% of its oil and gas competitors.

More enticingly, ERF trades at a forward multiple of 5.4. As a discount to projected earnings, Enerplus ranks better than 65.76% of the oil and gas competition.Like the other enterprises on this list, Enerplus enjoys other fiscal attributes.

Enticingly, though, DINO also trades at a forward multiple of 4.83.

Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils and lubricants – among other petroleum-based products – PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) is a vital cog in the broader infrastructure framework.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks For Income Investors. Inflation is hammering the globe and Canada is no exception. Inflation in Canada picked up speed last year, reaching its 40-year high and averaging 6.8%. The Canadian stock market became victim to growing inflation and rising rates as its benchmark index fell by 8.5%, as of December 30, 2022. However, this decline was insignificant in contrast to an 18.1% loss in the S&amp;P 500 last year. The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index is up 5.6% year-to-date.Though the Canadian stock market remained on a strong footing last year compared with its American counterpart, the recent collapse in the banking sector created havoc all over again. According to a report by Financial Post, some of the Canadian top banks’ stocks lost nearly $20 billion in market capitalization following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March. According to analysts, banks with acquisitions in the US could topple in the coming months. In addition to this, analysts are also expecting the Canadian economy to dip this year. In our article 10 High-Growth Canadian Dividend Stocks to Invest In, we mentioned data that suggests that a recession in the US will affect Canadian economic growth for three consecutive quarters, with a 0.9% expected overall contraction.Considering the current market outlook, investors are favoring dividend equities to stay afloat during this period.Dividend investment also involves investing steadily in dividend-focused exchange-traded funds as they hold a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks across different sectors and industries. Moreover, dividend ETFs also offer investors a steady stream of income, which is their main focus in today’s market environment. Danielle LeClair, director of Manager Research for Morningstar Canada, spoke with the financial services company and highlighted the significance of these funds for income investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues“Dividend and income funds have been popular options for Canadian investors because they offer an alternative to traditional fixed income products, which have faced challenges in the lower interest rate environment we have seen the last few years.”Dividend stocks in Canada are also generating positive returns this year. S&amp;P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of Canadian companies that have raised their dividends for at least five years, is up 3.79% year-to-date, as of May 7. In comparison, S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered a 2.35% return to shareholders since the start of the year.While US dividend stocks like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are popular among investors, Canadian dividend stocks are also reliable options for income investors.

FRT’s properties are strategically located in the first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan markets of the United States, aiding its first-quarter cash flows.Due to strong demographics and the infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. FRT’s well-diversified tenant base of retailers is expected to have led to steady rental revenue generation in the first quarter. Moreover, Federal Realty’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its acquisition and development activities in the first quarter.FRT's strategic focus on mixed-use properties enables the company to benefit from multiple revenue streams. By combining residential, retail and office spaces, these properties attract a variety of tenants, creating a vibrant, bustling atmosphere that draws in consumers. This diversification is likely to have played a crucial role in FRT's first-quarter 2023 performance as it insulates the company from the fluctuations and uncertainties of a single sector.Story continuesProjections for Q1 2023The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $276.81 million, calling for a 7.8% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for rental revenues is pegged at $275.30 million, suggesting a rise from the year-ago period’s $256.51 million.Rental income from minimum rents — commercial — is presently pegged at $178.85 million, up from $169.63 in the year-ago period. Rental income from cost reimbursements is projected at $52.19 million, up from $50.31 million in the prior-year period.Federal Realty’s activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent downward to $1.57 in the past month. However, it suggests 4.67% growth year over year.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Federal Realty this season.

135,5d0aa4c1-984c-3780-96c0-64aaa6be1571,AWK,2023-05-08,Those who invested in American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) five years ago are up 94%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-american-water-works-113834651.html,1683545914,STORY,['AWK'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) share price is up 80% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 3.2% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for American Water Works Company There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, American Water Works Company achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 12% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of American Water Works Company, it has a TSR of 94% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that American Water Works Company shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 3.2% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 14% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  American Water Works Company is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

136,f54d165e-a60f-3df1-ae70-7ba2e2408aa0,FCX,2023-05-08,The Top 3 Battery Material Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-3-battery-material-stocks-093015646.html,1683192615,STORY,"['FCX', 'ALB', 'PLL']","[Global electric vehicle sales soared an impressive 55% in 2022, and they are expected to jump 35% this year, taking them to 14 million. In the first quarter of 2023, 2.3 million EVs were delivered. Of course, all of these EVs have large batteries, and all of those batteries are made of raw materials. The companies that churn out those raw materials are going to make a great deal of money, making it a good idea to buy the best battery material stocks.Among the most important materials in EV batteries are lithium and copper. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  CEO Elon Musk recently showed how important lithium is to EV makers by literally begging companies to mine and refine lithium. “We’re begging you …. Instead of making a picture-sharing app, please refine lithium. Mining and refining,” Musk said. And according to Mining.com, “A battery electric vehicle requires 2.5 times more copper than a standard internal combustion engine vehicle. Much of that is in the electric motor, some in the battery.”Given these points, all of the best battery material stocks I will recommend today will be the shares of either copper miners or lithium miners.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFreeport-McMoran (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comIn the first quarter, Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX), one of the world’s leading copper miners, produced 965 million pounds of the metal and sold 832 million pounds of it. The company’s EBITDA, excluding certain items, came in a a strong $2.2 billion. It generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion.FCX says that, according to an S&amp;P Global study, the demand for copper will reach roughly 50 million tonnes in 2035, up from about 25 million tonnes this year. This comes as “Low carbon technologies [are driving] massive growth in metals demand.” And FCX believes that it can obtain an additional 235 billion pounds of copper to meet the rapidly climbing demand.If copper reaches $5 per pound and gold stays at its current level of around $2,000 per ounce, FCX estimates that its annual EBITDA would jump to around $14 billion, up from $9.3 billion last year.Story continuesGiven the large amount of copper needed for EVs and renewables, along with the economic rebound of China, I believe that copper prices will reach $5 per pound within a year or two.Piedmont Lithium (PLL)Person holding cellphone with logo of US mining company Piedmont Lithium Inc. (PLL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comPiedmont (NASDAQ:PLL), a lithium-mining startup, has multiple, positive attributes. Unlike many other such startups, it’s slated to start generating significant revenues within the next 12 to 18 months. That’s because the company obtained an equity interest in a lithium mine located in Ghana. As long as Piedmont infuses enough cash into the venture, PLL will obtain a 50% stake in the project, which is expected to start producing lithium by the end of 2024. Piedmont appears to owe $87 million for the project, and it had $99 million of cash as of the end of last year, with only  $1.77 million of debt.Meanwhile, the company is working to launch a North Carolina lithium mine that’s expected to start producing the metal in 2026.And most impressively, Piedmont has a deal to deliver lithium to one of the world’s largest consumers of the metal, Tesla. Piedmont is going to supply about 125,000 tonnes of lithium to the EV maker “between the second half of 2023 and the end of 2025.” Piedmont will obtain the lithium from a Canadian company, so its margins from the deal will probably be low. Still, Tesla is likely to continue buying lithium from Piedmont after its North Carolina mine starts producing the metal in a few years.PLL’s current market capitalization of $1 billion greatly underestimates its long-term value.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB), one of the world’s largest lithium miners, reported very strong fourth quarter results in February, as its revenue soared 193% year over year and came in slightly ahead of analysts’ average estimates. More impressively, its earnings per share climbed 753% to $8.62, also beating analysts’ mean outlook.For all of this year, the lithium miner expects to generate net sales of $11.3 billion to $12.9 billion and EPS, excluding some items, of $26 to $33. That means that, at the midpoint of its EPS guidance, ALB is changing hands for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 6x. That’s an extraordinarily low valuation, given the company’s rapid growth and leverage to the EV revolution.Worries  about declining lithium prices and a lithium nationalization proposal by Chile’s left-wing president have weighed on ALB stock. But lithium prices are likely to rebound sharply, given the rapid proliferation of EVs. And Chile’s president has said that he’ll honor Albemarle’s mining concession which runs through 2043, although he asked the company to allow the government to get involved in its operations before its contract expires.But Chile’s congress, which has already rejected the president’s tax reform agenda, is unlikely to approve his lithium nationalization proposal.Albemarle’s status as a top lithium miner and its low valuation make it one of the best battery materials stocks to buy.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of FCX.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this biopharmaceutical company would post earnings of $9.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $12.56, delivering a surprise of 29.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Regeneron , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $3.16 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Regeneron shares have added about 11.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.5%.What's Next for Regeneron?While Regeneron has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Regeneron: mixed.
