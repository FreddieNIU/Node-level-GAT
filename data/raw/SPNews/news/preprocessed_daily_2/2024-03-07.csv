On February 7, Morgan Stanley reported that equity markets may enjoy another good year. While the market is expected to be more volatile this year compared to 2023, there are several reasons why the year could be beneficial for equity investors. Retail fund flows in the US are expected to increase. In November 2023, long-term flows into mutual funds and ETFs emerged as positive. That said, Morgan Stanley expects the trend to persist in 2024. Investors are willing to allocate more money to riskier assets, some being equities. Additionally, the Fed is already done raising interest rates. While the first rate cut is still awaited, the time until such is implemented may be the best time to invest in stocks. The Fed is not willing to initiate a rate cut anytime soon, leaving more time for the market to mature. Cooling inflation rates and expanding markets will shape the investment outlook in 2024. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, almost 90% of the stocks in the S&P 1500 index were above their 50-day moving average. Such suggests why investors have a bullish take on stocks.

But a 10.1-ounce box of Froot Loops sells for $4.49, which equals just a little over 44 cents per ounce.', 'Although you might be tempted to pick up party supplies while grocery shopping, it’s not the cheapest option. You can find better-priced party supplies at discount stores or dollar stores. Dollar stores often buy in bulk, purchase overstocked items and sell less-durable items, which is why you often can find much better deals there.', 'To get an idea of how much you can save by buying party supplies somewhere else, Dollar Tree sells Happy Birthday banners for just $1.25 each. Discount retailer Five Below has birthday banners for $3, while birthday party banners at Kroger start at $10.', 'An average-sized pineapple, which retails\xa0for about $2.50 at the grocery store, yields approximately 4 1/2 cups of 1-inch pineapple cubes. In all, you’ll get about 6 ounces of pineapple in a cup, or a total of 36 ounces per pineapple at a cost of approximately 7 cents per ounce.\xa0Meanwhile, just 12 ounces of fresh cut-up pineapple at the same grocery store costs $4.49 or 37 cents per ounce.', 'If the prickly exterior of this tropical fruit is what’s keeping you from cutting up your own pineapple, don’t worry.

But at what cost? You might be surprised to find out just how many more muffins you could get for your money by baking them.', 'A 12-count package of mini-muffins from the grocery store bakery costs $6.09. One box of Krusteaz 18.6-ounce box of muffin mix yields roughly 24 to 30 mini muffins for $3.19. Even with the cost of adding your own eggs and vegetable oil to the mix, you can get more than double the muffins at about the same price if you make them yourself.', 'Although no one can argue that snack-size bags aren’t convenient, you’ll have to decide how much the convenience is worth to you.

A 13.5-ounce bag of Lay’s chips costs $5.69, or about 37 cents per ounce.', 'And if you fear you’ll miss the smaller, more convenient portions snack-size bags provide, go ahead and buy the bulk package. Then, portion it out into ultra-cheap, snack-size zipper-seal bags.', 'A 2-pound bag of dry pinto beans will yield about 12 cups of cooked beans, according to The Bean Institute, and costs $4.09.\xa0A 16-ounce can of Bush’s Best cooked pinto beans costs $1.33 at HEB and provides only two cups of cooked beans. It would take six cans of pinto beans — which would total $7.98 — to yield the same amount of beans as a 2-pound bag. By buying cooked beans, you nearly double the price for the same quantity.', 'It’s true that opening a can of beans and heating them on the stovetop takes less time and effort than picking through pintos to make sure there aren’t any bad beans, soaking them, seasoning them and keeping watch while they cook. But you can cook the beans in a slow cooker and effectively set it and forget it. Plus, you’ll be able to freeze the leftover beans for another time.', 'A can of frozen orange juice concentrate costs anywhere from $2.85 to $3.40 for Minute Maid brand.

It’s only 50 cents more to save a few minutes and pull perfectly formed burgers out of the package.', 'However, if you eat burgers a few times a week, you could shave dollars off your grocery bill. Plus, when you make your own patties, you can form them into the size and type you prefer (smash burgers, anyone?) and add your own seasonings — or even cheese or bacon bits — inside. Buying ground beef instead of burgers also gives you the flexibility to easily whip up a casserole, spaghetti with meat sauce or tacos instead of burgers.', 'Hard boiling your own eggs takes time. First, you have to wait for the water to boil and then cook them for roughly 11 minutes. Then, the eggs need to cool a bit before you can peel them.', 'A handy, counter-top egg cooker can streamline the process. But if you want the really easy way: Buy pre-boiled eggs from the grocery store. The catch is that you’re paying someone else to do the work.', 'A half-dozen hard-boiled eggs from Eggland’s Best cost $3.49. A dozen similar raw eggs cost between $2.99 and $3.19 depending on where you shop. You can also find uncooked eggs for less than $1 at Aldi.', 'It might be convenient to pick up batteries while you do your grocery shopping, but, as with so many items on the list, you’ll pay more for the convenience. For example, one package of four Duracell AA batteries costs $6.39 at the grocery store, regularly priced. You may find them on sale for $4.99, or $1.25 per battery.', 'Walmart has an 8-pack of Duracell AA batteries for $9.18, or $1.15 per battery. Even better, pick up a 48-pack of Duracell batteries for $30 at BJ’s wholesale club, which is just 62 cents per battery.

But you might not want to make a habit of doing so.', 'You’ll pay up to $5.29 at the grocery store for a 24-ounce tray of prepared mashed potatoes, which is approximately 22 cents per ounce. But bagged russet potatoes are around 4 cents per ounce. That’s nearly\xa018 cents per ounce less than the prepared potatoes.', 'Although precut veggies are super convenient when hosting a party, you’ll pay considerably more for not having to prep. A 12 oz. bag of store brand washed and ready-to-eat broccoli florets costs $2.99 or 25 cents per ounce. On the other hand, a broccoli crown, which weighs roughly 1 pound, costs just $2.07 at the same store. You’ll save nearly $1 and get 4 oz. more of fresh vegetables.', 'And, let’s face it. You’re probably re-washing that pre-washed broccoli from a bag before you serve it, anyway, so you’re not saving that much food prep time.', 'When you’re running short on time to shop, having the option to grab a gift card while you’re picking up a cake can be the perfect solution. But grocery stores aren’t known for discounting their gift cards.', 'You can, however, get bulk discounts at warehouse clubs such as Sam’s Club or Costco. A paid membership is required to shop at both stores, but in many cases, it’s worth it.', 'Picking up your toiletries or makeup during a grocery store run isn’t the wisest choice in most cases. Although you might get lucky and find an in-store special for your favorite toothpaste or shampoo, you generally can save if you opt to buy these items at a discount store such as Walmart.', 'For example, you’ll pay up to $9.29 for an 8.5-ounce bottle of L’Oreal sulfate-free Color Care shampoo at the grocery store, or $1.09 per ounce. But if you make a trip to Walmart, you can get L’Oreal EverPure sulfate free shampoo and conditioner — each in 8.5 ounce bottles — for $13.97 for both, or 82 cents per ounce.', 'If you’re willing to experiment with different brands and don’t require sulfate-free hair care products, Dollar Tree has the best deals with brands like White Rain in 22.5 oz. bottles for just $1.25.', 'It can be tempting to grab some shiny new cookware as you stroll the supermarket aisles. But you’d be wise to walk on by.', 'Stop & Shop’s store brand Smart Living non-stick 11.75-inch saute pan retails for $20, although you can get it on sale for $16. On the other hand, Walmart offers its Mainstays non-stick, ceramic-coated 12-inch frying pan for just $12.77.', 'Taco seasoning is a great pantry staple to have on hand for quick weeknight dinners. But if you’re buying national brands like Ortega, Old El Paso, or McCormick, you’re paying more than you have to. These seasoning mix packets sell for $1.29 to $1.39 at the grocery store, while Nature’s Promise Organic sells for $1.09 for the same size, a savings of 20 to 30 cents per ounce.', 'Even better, buy the large size of Old El Paso taco seasoning mix and use what you need for each meal. You’ll pay just $4.59 for a 6.25 oz. can, enough for six taco dinners, at just 73 cents per ounce.', 'If you have cleaning supplies on your grocery list, you might want to cross them off and wait until you visit a discount store.

Lysol Crisp Linen Disinfecting Spray goes for nearly $9 for a 19 oz. can at Stop & Shop in New York.

When I said mixed at Target, it's they sell a lot more discretionary goods, value-priced discretionary goods, but the consumer has been a little more reticent to buy those products these days.

They're the largest grocer in America. But 40% of what they sell is discretionary. And they are serving the customer better across the board."", ""They're bringing in better quality products. They're bringing in tremendous value.

(NYSE:JWN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.19 per share on the 27th of March. This means the annual payment is 4.3% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.', ' See our latest analysis for Nordstrom ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, the company wasn't making enough to cover what it was paying to shareholders. This situation certainly isn't ideal, and could place significant strain on the balance sheet if it continues."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 18%, which is in a comfortable range for us.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.76. This works out to be a decline of approximately 4.5% per year over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Earnings per share has been sinking by 25% over the last five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""Overall, this isn't a great candidate as an income investment, even though the dividend was stable this year. The company seems to be stretching itself a bit to make such big payments, but it doesn't appear they can be consistent over time. Overall, the dividend is not reliable enough to make this a good income stock."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Please note that when discussing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on an adjusted basis for EBIT, EBIT margin and earnings per share. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found at the end of this presentation and our Q4 2023 earnings press release, both of which are available on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Erik."", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll start with our fourth quarter performance and discuss our 2023 priorities and cover what we're focused on for 2024.We delivered a strong fourth quarter with net sales of $4.3 billion and earnings per share of $0.96. For the full year, our results were within or better than the guidance we laid out, and we accomplished what we set out to do: enhance the customer experience and drive better financial performance.Ahead of the holiday shopping season, our teams worked hard to deliver the right assortment as well as provide engaging experiences for our customers. As a result of these efforts, we achieved sequential improvement in net sales, profitability, number of customers and purchase trips in the fourth quarter.Throughout 2023, we remain focused on 3 priorities intended to drive better financial performance while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Our first priority was to improve Nordstrom Rack performance. One way that we did that was by opening 19 new stores in 2023. New Rack stores continue to be an excellent investment as they deliver well in excess of their cost of capital with a relatively short payback period.However, it's not just the new stores that drove the Rack's impressive net sales growth in the fourth quarter as Rack comparable store sales also grew by high single digits. Our Rack digital business also improved in traffic and conversion in the fourth quarter, enabling sales, which contributed to NordstromRack.com's full year profitability. From a merchandise standpoint, we focused our efforts to improve our offering at the Rack as we know that delivering great brands at great prices is what our customers want. Our second priority in 2023 was to increase inventory productivity. We continue to focus on managing inventory effectively as evidenced by the positive sales to inventory spread in the fourth quarter, which sets us up well from a merchandise standpoint as we start the new fiscal year. Additionally, our efforts to reduce the overhang of designer inventory met our target, and our overall newness of inventory is stronger than it was a year ago, given we had fewer aged items to clear through.Our third priority of 2023 was to optimize our supply chain capabilities, a continuation of efforts that began in 2022. In Q4, for the sixth consecutive quarter, the team delivered another 50-plus basis points of improvement in variable supply chain expense savings, while at the same time, improving our click to delivery speed. Building on the momentum of our efforts to optimize our supply chain, we have made the strategic decision to relocate operations from our Fulfillment Center in San Bernardino, California, to our West Coast Omnichannel Center, just 25 miles away in Riverside. WCOC has been scaling for several years now and is well positioned to serve our customers across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners following the investments we have made to enhance capabilities at the facility. It is our newest, most automated facility, offering a substantially lower processing cost per unit. We recorded a $32 million asset impairment and related charge due to this relocation.We're pleased with the results of our efforts against our 3 priorities for 2023 as not only did they drive better financial outcomes for the company, but also supported our efforts to improve the customer experience. Next, I'd like to take a moment to discuss merchandise performance in the fourth quarter as Pete is away in market and unable to join us today.We came into Q4 at a much healthier inventory position than in the prior year, resulting in fewer markdowns during the quarter, which helped to drive an expansion of our gross profit margin by 125 basis points. Active, Beauty and Women's Apparel were our best-performing categories in the fourth quarter, with strong growth versus the prior year.The Active category was led by Shoes, with strength from brands like On Running and HOKA as well as apparel brand, Vuori. We leaned into Beauty with a strong gift selection for holiday as well as a 5x point promotion for our Nordy Club members. This offer drove incremental trips and conversion while creating a halo effect in other categories.Fragrance was the top performer in Beauty at both banners, highlighted by brands such as Burberry, YSL and Marc Jacobs. At the Nordstrom banner, designer makeup drove strong growth from Chanel, Tom Ford and Dior while the skincare category improved compared with the previous year. At the Rack, the rollout of an expanded offering of haircare products supported our outsized growth.The improvement in Women's Apparel was supported by seasonally relevant newness in addition to our turnaround with the young customer, which is an area we have a multiyear plan to improve. We are pleased with the progress in this area in Q4, which was led by our Nordstrom private brands. At the Nordstrom banner, dressier categories were the best performing. Brands such as Vince, Veronica Beard, and Cinq à Sept delivered solid growth. Overall, we exited 2023 with improved inventory levels versus the prior year, which provides us the opportunity to have a consistent flow of relevant product as we move towards spring. Turning to 2024. We're confident in our plan for the year. Building upon the work we did in 2023, we've refreshed our 3 key priorities for 2024: Driving Nordstrom banner growth, optimizing operationally, and building on momentum at the Rack.The first priority is to drive growth at our Nordstrom banner. Our customers value the relevance and inspiration that we offer. We aim to provide that by offering a compelling product mix along with creating an environment where they not only shop their favorite brands and products but also discover new ones. We will focus our Nordstrom banner efforts on digital-led growth supported by our stores.One thing we're excited about is the launch of our digital markets on Nordstrom.com starting in April. By reimagining the way we work with our brand partners, we'll grow our curated online assortment to serve more customers on even more occasions through increasing our use of unowned inventory. Marketplace will allow customers to shop more products and sizes from their favorite brands while providing them more access to new and emerging brands.As we do this, we're also creating a more personalized digital experience that makes it easy for our customers to navigate our growing assortment. Expanding our assortment through unowned inventory has the potential to drive GMV growth in addition to providing compelling economics. We'll also drive Nordstrom growth by amplifying the brands that matter most to our customers, along with ensuring we have the depth in these brands, consistently across our stores and online. Beauty will also continue to play a prominent role in our assortment and growth. Our efforts are designed to create more engagement in addition to improving retention while serving customers on more occasions with the breadth of assortment that they expect from us. Our second priority for 2024, operational optimization, builds upon the success that we've had in optimizing our supply chain capabilities. This entails a focus on driving faster fulfillment and delivery for our customers as well as maximizing our inventory value through its life cycle.We will continue our efforts to improve inventory integrity and optimize inventory positioning along with increasing the speed of product to the customer. We are making investments in systems and technology enablers to standardize and streamline our inventory processes, expanding the scale of our RFID utilization and improving the inventory movement within our business, all with the end goal of enhancing the customer experience and improving our cost position.Our third priority for 2024 is building on the momentum at the Rack. Opening new Rack stores is a profitable investment as well as a key way to reach more new customers and drive Rack banner growth. As we're opening more new stores, we're finding our performance and efficiency continues to improve. Expanding our network of stores brings our omnichannel services closer to the customer, giving them more reasons and opportunities to engage with us.We consistently hear how customers enjoy the convenience of shopping between our banners, taking advantage of the services we offer, including cross-banner in-store returns, Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store and alterations. In 2023, we opened 19 new stores, and our intent is to open 22 new stores in 2024. Rack stores continue to be a growth engine for our company as they are our largest source of new customer acquisition, accounting for over 40%.Growing our store count also supports long-term customer retention. In fact, roughly 1/4 of retained Rack customers migrate to the Nordstrom banner within 4 years. We aim to deliver top line Rack growth led by stores and supported by enhanced digital capabilities in 2024. To that end, in addition to growing the number of Rack stores, we also intend to continue the profitable momentum at Nordstromrack.com. By leveraging our digital assets, our suite of omnichannel offerings will enable us to grow our selection online as well as enhance the customer experience as we strive to deliver great brands at great prices for our customers regardless of how they choose to shop. Before I turn it over to Cathy for a review of the financials, I want to thank our teams for their focus on exceptional service to our customers and execution of the day-to-day business while remaining steadfast on our priorities. We're proud of the efforts that we undertook in 2023 as well as the outcomes that enhance the customer experience and drove improved financial results.Through a clear set of priorities, we're confident that we'll end 2024 as an even stronger company. And with that, I'll hand it over to Cathy."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Thanks, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. Although it was mentioned in the forward-looking statement at the beginning of this call, when I speak to our results and outlook, it will be on an adjusted basis for EBIT, EBIT margin and EPS, for which the relevant reconciliations can be found at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our website.I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter results, then provide some additional commentary about our transition from retail to cost accounting, discuss our outlook for 2024 and quarterly timing and close with our capital allocation priorities. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.96 compared with $0.74 in the year ago quarter. We were pleased with the financial results and momentum throughout the year and that we delivered on our guidance.In Q4, we finished with year-over-year increases in gross margin, EBIT and EPS, despite net sales that were essentially flat on a like-for-like basis. Net sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter, which includes a benefit of 460 basis points related to the 53rd week and 250 basis points unfavorable impact from the wind down of Canadian operations.Total GMV increased 2% in the fourth quarter. Nordstrom banner net sales decreased 3%, including a 410 basis point benefit related to the 53rd week and a 355 basis point negative impact from the wind down of Canadian operations. Nordstrom banner GMV decreased 3% in the fourth quarter. Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 15%, including a benefit of 580 basis points related to the 53rd week.Throughout the year, we saw steady progress quarter-over-quarter in the top line as we focused on this growth driver. Although digital sales in the fourth quarter decreased 2% compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, we saw quarter-over-quarter sales improvement. Digital sales represented 38% of total sales during the quarter.Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.4% increased 125 basis points compared with the same period last year due to lower markdowns, lower buying and occupancy costs and leverage on higher sales. Ending inventory decreased 3% in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress on inventory productivity we delivered this year.As Erik mentioned, we exited the year with improved inventory levels versus last year, which set us up well to start the new fiscal year. Reported SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 85 basis points in the fourth quarter, including a $32 million supply chain asset impairment and related charge. Excluding the charge, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were in line with the year ago quarter as the impact of higher labor costs was offset by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiencies and leverage on higher sales.Our supply chain initiatives continue to deliver strong results over the last year. Our EBIT margin for the fourth quarter was 5.7% versus 4.5% in the year ago quarter, and we ended the fourth quarter with $1.4 billion in available liquidity, including over $600 million in cash. Our balance sheet and financial position remain solid.Next, I want to take a moment to speak about our fiscal 2024 conversion from the retail method of accounting for inventory to the cost method. This shift to operating in units and cost lays the foundation for us to deliver on our business priorities more effectively. We will see profitability at the item level, guiding us in executing with intention and speed. We anticipate that utilizing cost accounting for financial reporting purposes in 2024 will result in a slight headwind in our 2024 results. More on that in a moment.Turning to our outlook for the year, I'll start by discussing the current environment and related assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect 2024 to be a year of continued momentum toward the long-term strength and durability of our business. We continue to see a cautious consumer that is mindful of discretionary purchases in light of inflation, higher interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments. Regardless of the external environment, we will remain focused and expect to make progress on the 3 2024 priorities that Erik discussed, following the solid execution against our 2023 priorities.In 2024, we expect full year revenue in the range of a decline of 2% to an increase of 1%, which includes a headwind of approximately 135 basis points from the 53rd week in 2023's results. We expect revenue to follow a typical quarterly cadence. In 2023, our credit card revenue represented slightly over 3% of net sales. We anticipate credit card revenues should be closer to 3% of net sales in 2024.Now that we are consistently opening new Rack stores, we will be providing comparable sales data on a quarterly basis beginning in Q1. As such, we expect total company comparable sales in a range of a decrease of 1% to an increase of 2% in 2024 versus 52 weeks in 2023.Turning to profitability. We expect EBIT margin in the range of 3.5% to 4%, with EBIT reflecting slight pressure due to the aforementioned conversion from retail to cost accounting and modest increases in SG&A to support Rack growth. We expect a 2 percentage point increase in our effective tax rate, relative to 2023, to be back at our typical rate of 27%.From an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate full year results in the range of $1.65 to $2.05, again, weighed upon modestly by the accounting method change as well as the anticipated increase in our effective tax rate relative to 2023. Although we don't typically focus on our guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I would like to offer a few comments on our expectations for the cadence of the year.The estimated timing of markdown recognition under the retail method versus the cost method is anticipated to weigh heavier on the first half results, primarily in Q1. Under the retail method of accounting, last year's Q1 benefited modestly to the timing of markdown recognition in Q4 2022. However, under the cost method, we do not anticipate that to repeat. We expect this Q1's results to be near breakeven to a slight loss and Q2 to have about 1/3 of the year's earnings. As the year progresses, with our anniversary sale almost entirely in the second quarter as 1 week shifts back out of Q3, the rest of the year should follow a more traditional cadence as the estimated headwind from the change in accounting method lessens throughout the year.Turning to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same. The first is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5x.We have a bond maturity of $250 million in April that we intend to retire using cash on hand. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share.In closing, we made great progress against our priorities and delivered on our guidance for the year in 2023. I'm looking forward to the progress that we'll make this year and getting after the growth opportunities we have, both at Nordstrom banner and the Rack. As I mentioned earlier, we expect 2024 to be a year of continued momentum toward the long-term strength and durability of our business.We thank you for your interest in Nordstrom. And with that, Jamie, we are ready for questions."", 'James Duies', ""Thank you, Cathy. (Operator Instructions) We'll now move to the Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ashley Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Chandana Naga Sai Madaka', 'This is Chandana on for Ashley today. So looking at Rack store openings, I think you mentioned intent to open 22 new stores in 2024. Could you speak to the cadence of those openings throughout the year? And maybe if you could help us break down how much of the Rack banners growth this year will come from new stores versus same stores?', 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Chandana, this is Cathy. So first off, throughout the course of the year, just like in 2023, we'll see -- there'll be a spring cohort and a fall cohort. We don't specifically time them one or the other, but you'll see that it's spread through the course of the year. We're -- we continue to be very, very excited about the Rack opportunity. They have continued to drive a strong return on investment. They're a great source of new customer acquisition to the Nordstrom banner, and they have great economics. So we continue to be excited about them as we move forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies.', 'Blake Anderson', ""It's Blake on for Ashley. First, I wanted to ask on the sales guide range for 2024. Just any color you can give on expectations by banner, and then your expectations for AUR versus transactions? And maybe if you could talk about what that was for those 2 items in 2023."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Maybe, Blake, I'll start and Erik can answer on as well. So with regards to the guidance for revenue, so first, let me parse a little bit of comp versus revenue -- comp guidance versus revenue. Comp guidance is a little stronger as we think about -- it's a 52- to 52-week impact, so I just want to acknowledge the revenue guidance is versus the extra week we had in 2023.That said, though, to your question, we're excited to grow where the market is growing. We're going to grow with Rack and the off-price channel. You're going to see us continue to lean into that growth driver for us, and then you'll see -- we expect digital to grow as the market is, but we're going to be below the market's growth as we move from this year into next. We're very, very focused on driving digital growth. We know that things like choice count matter there, and so we're excited about the marketplace comment that Erik shared in the remarks. That will help obviously drive choice count.We're focused on assortment for digital, and we're going to continue to drive that lower price point like that under $100 price point to drive growth there, and then the overall experience in digital. So we're continuing to focus on driving there. And then the last place of growth would be the Nordstrom stores. Erik talked about that in his prepared remarks. Expect that to be a little bit more in the flattish range as you think about by the banner in the channel, but we're really excited about having the assortment in the stores that matter most for our customers. We have a concerted effort on making sure that we do that this year, having great service and experience that we're known for.So that will hopefully help you with a little bit of color around each of the banners and channels inside that guidance. And then on AUR, that one is difficult to predict. We're all expecting, I think, for AURs to start to come down, but that's going to be a little bit more difficult to predict."", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Yes. I guess like other color I'd add. One more detail. First of all, store traffic. Store traffic continues to be on the soft side, although traffic at the Nordstrom banner stores did improve sequentially throughout the year. It is AUR that is in both banners helping to drive improved selling prices, which is leading in average trip value going up. Digitally, also some soft traffic, but again, average order value and average selling price, both of those increased at both Nordstrom.com and rack.com."", 'Blake Anderson', ""That's super helpful. I appreciate the color. And then our follow-up is on EBIT margins. Can you just elaborate on the puts and takes for those this year? I know you said the accounting change and then you're investing in store growth. The guide is 3.5% to 4%, slightly below 4% this year. What's -- any more detail you can kind of give for us on the headwinds next year? And then would love to hear any commentary on what kind of top line do you need in the future or any other initiatives you need to see on the top line in order to get margin expansion."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Yes. So thanks. We're very focused on continuing to drive both market share gains as well as margin expansion. So know that that's where our focus is. Inside the guide for 2024, to answer your question, though, we made great progress in gross margin expansion this year in 2023, the year we just concluded. We would expect to continue to drive a little bit of gross margin expansion. It is being offset, though, by some SG&A headwinds, so expense headwinds. While we continue to drive productivity in places like supply chain, we're offsetting it with investments in new Rack store openings and a little bit of inflation in things like labor that we're not fully offsetting."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ed Yruma with Piper Sandler.', 'Edward James Yruma', ""Two quick ones for me. I guess, first, if you could give us an update on some of your kind of city center, big box Nordstrom stores. I know for some period of time, they were pressured by traffic trends, but we'd kind of love to hear any color you have there.And then as a follow-up, on some of the newer Rack stores, would love to understand maybe the return profile. Have they been ramping as quickly as you had expected, particularly those in new markets?"", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Yes, this is Erik. I'll take the first one. Cathy can get second one. Yes, we have really not seen that difference between urban and suburban stores through '23 like we did kind of through the pandemic for a couple of years. Some of our fastest-growing stores this past year or our big urban flagship stores, in particular, New York has shown real strong growth."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""On the Rack stores, the return profile, to answer your question. As you know, it's kind of a new muscle. We started rebuilding this last year, so in 2023, we opened 19 stores kind of in 2 cohorts, a spring cohort and a fall cohort. We took all the learnings we had from the earlier ones into the later ones. We'll take the learnings from both of those into this year as we continue to evolve a little bit around the edges. So things like the amount of investment in a new store, how much we support it with inventory, all of those things. They just keep getting better and better.They come out really strong, as you would imagine. We are working to make sure we sustain that growth throughout the duration though. We are great about supporting with lots of inventory upfront and lots of marketing, and we need to make sure we continue to do that. All in, though, we're really, really excited about the great return on investment, great acquisition of new customers for our total banner -- our total brand."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.', 'Brooke Siler Roach', ""I was hoping to get an update on what you're seeing on profitability of the dot-com business. It sounds like you saw some nice improvement in rack.com's profitability this year. Where does that sit today compared to full line and total company margin rates? And what's the opportunity for continued improvement in 2024?"", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Maybe I'll start, but obviously, Erik can add on as well. So it has been a distinct effort of ours to get the Rack digital business profitable. As we've spoken to, it is profitable for 2023, the full year. Really proud of the work that the team has done to drive that business improvement. The Nordstrom.com business, though, is actually quite profitable. It's one of our most profitable channels, and so we'll continue to have that Nordstrom.com digital business lead our growth in the Nordstrom banner. It's a great vehicle for us, and it's how the customer is choosing to shop.Going forward, though, to your question on where is maybe rack.com versus Nordstrom.com, still growing or still expanding in margin. We'll continue to work on that. Some of the fundamental things we worked on in '23 were things like inventory integrity that allows us to then start turning on omnichannel capabilities more completely for our customers as they come into Rack. So where -- we'll continue to expand rack.com's profitability, but pleased with both of them that they're solidly in the black and Nordstrom.com is well past that."", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Yes, Brooke, I'd just -- I'd add on -- first, I think in the context, you look at our digital business, first and foremost, we look at it through the customer lens, which is a customer experience that cuts across digital and physical. Almost every customer does that. So we really look at how we can leverage our physical and digital assets to serve the customer better.That being said, if you look back over our bigger actions over the last couple of years, we have taken some -- made some decisions and some tough ones that were really about reducing unprofitable sales. So growth in Canada would be a part of that, doing -- shutting down store fulfillment out of our rack.com business is another example.So as we look at it, to Cathy's point of -- the financial model in our digital business is really strong, and it scales well. It scales really well. We have, over the last couple of years, really address the unprofitable parts of the business. Both platforms are very much poised for growth, and we need growth out of both of them."", 'Brooke Siler Roach', 'Cathy, if I could just ask one quick follow-up. You gave some helpful color on the credit card revenue at close to 3% of sales in 2024. Can you elaborate on the assumptions that are embedded within that, and what the impact is of the late fee changes in credit revenue based on the announcement today?', 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Yes, happy to. And interesting timing on the announcement today for sure, given it's our day of earnings release. So I want to start with reminding us that the average credit quality of our portfolio tends to be higher than some of our peers, so therefore, late fees are a smaller piece of the overall credit revenue to our P&L. So I'll start there.We do expect there to be some legal challenges, too. I suspect as soon as the federal register actually registers the new regulation, we'll see some legal challenges, and we'll continue to monitor that. But most importantly, the estimate -- our best estimate has been included in our guidance that we've given today.So we've been monitoring it. We expect there will be continued pressure both politically and from consumers on late fees. And so we did build that into our guidance the best estimate we have."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Good afternoon, everyone. Just expanding on some of the merchandising comments, with Active, Beauty and Women's Apparel being the most improved this year -- this quarter, last quarter, I believe accessories was in that mix. What was different this quarter from last quarter with accessories and what are you seeing there?And then also just following up on the merchandise margin. Any impacts on Red Sea or how you're thinking about freight costs and delivery costs for this year embedded in the margin?"", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Yes, accessories, handbags in particular, which is a big category in accessories for I think for everyone, has not been as strong kind of through the year. So we continue to see that. That being said, every single merchandise category that we have did improve sequentially from Q3 to Q4. So we're also encouraged about that.On the merch margin question, we really don't see at this point, an effect from what's going on in the Red Sea on our merch margin. We have some portion of our goods that's delayed a bit, but we don't see any material effect to our results."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.', 'Neil Goh', 'This is Neil Goh on for Oliver today. Nice to see inventories managed pretty well in line with sales growth. What are your expectations on inventory management throughout the year? And then how would you describe the promo environment leading into spring summer? And any implications on merch margins as we get through the fiscal year?', 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Neil, maybe I'll give a start and then Erik can add. So on inventory growth, to your point, thank you for the comment on inventory productivity or the management of inventory. I think the team did a terrific job of building some new disciplines and really being sensitive to the trends and chasing into it. I think we're poised really well as we ended the year in inventory health. As we ended the year and then begin the new year, allows us to have some newness, which is always important for customers. So very, very excited about where inventory is at and the progress we've made around inventory productivity.As we move through the year, we'll be prudent. So we're going to continue the same disciplines of making sure we're chasing into demand. The team's really excited to be at a year where we feel like we're on the front foot there. And so that's nice. So we would expect that when you think about inventory. We're going to continue to support Beauty. We're going to continue to support the new Rack stores. So that will continue to be a little bit of a place that will support with extra inventory. And then on promotional environment, maybe I'll ask Erik to opine on that as we think about it going forward."", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Yes, Neil, I'd say we really are not seeing an elevated promotional environment. We didn't see it through Q4. We're not seeing it right now. So as best as we can tell, we don't anticipate an unusually elevated promotional environment."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.', 'Warren Cheng', ""This is Warren Cheng on for Michael. I just had a follow-up on Brooke's question on the CFPB ruling. The last time you broke out credit income, I think that was back in 2015, late fees were low teens percentage of the credit card revenue stream. Is that still a fair benchmark used for today's business? And I also just wanted to clarify your comment that your best estimate for the outcome is already included in the guidance today. Could you just elaborate on what that means?"", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Yes, happy to, Warren. So first off, I didn't know that we actually supplied that information in 2015. So thank you for the information there. Obviously, that's been a long time ago, and the business continues to evolve. That said, our loyalty customers are still our best customers. And as you know, a good portion of them pulled the Nordstrom card. The comment I shared around our best estimate of the impact of the CFPB ruling that came out today is included in our guidance. It is. It's exactly what we had estimated. I know there's been a ton of speculation. I don't know if we just -- we're fortunate there, but our team, I think, estimated that we knew it'd be coming out, and there's going to be -- obviously, all of the guidance had said it's going to be about where it came out at. So we tried to include that in our guidance we gave today. With regards to the amount of late fees as a percentage of our income, we haven't disclosed that, but it is less than our competitors, given the quality of our credit portfolio."", 'Warren Cheng', ""Got it. That's very helpful. And then I just had a follow-up on the Rack business. I was wondering if we could focus for a second on the new Rack stores that have opened in the last 12 months. How does the productivity stack up against the base? And then can you also discuss the ramp behavior for these stores relative to product cohorts and also versus your expectations?"", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Sure. Warren, this is Erik. Yes, our new stores productivity is a little above our average on a sales per square foot basis. So they do tend to be smaller volume stores. As you imagine, we've -- our portfolio to date has been in -- we start with the best locations. And -- but the average size of our stores is a bit smaller than what we had previously. So productivity is really good. The ramp -- we do see an opportunity for us to build upon the excitement we get at a Rack opening, particularly we go to new markets. We get really strong traffic and a lot of energy in the community. For some of those communities there where we don't have a Nordstrom store, it's the first entry of our company into that market.So we do think we have opportunities to build upon that knowledge of the second year -- of the first year and continue to drive the growth. And I think that's kind of the main takeaway for Rack businesses. The focus on our key strategic brands really cuts across all aspects of the Rack business. The new stores, comp business, our online business, and we think there's still a lot of opportunities there for us to really leverage, which we think is a competitive advantage. The access to these coveted brands that customers associate with Nordstrom. And as we continue to focus and emphasize those strategic brands, it really is lifting all boats."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.', 'Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson', ""I wanted to ask about the supply chain initiatives. They've been very successful in reducing your distribution costs. What inning would you say we're in of that program? And where do you see the expected benefits on a go-forward basis?"", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Yes, I'll start. Cathy can chime in. If I leave something out, you may note we changed our wording a bit from optimizing supply chain to optimizing operationally. And the point with that really is internally that it's not just about technically our supply chain network that we see opportunities in addition to continuing to drive productivity out of our network, to managing our inventory throughout its life cycle.You look at our model, it is unique. Most retailers have stores and have a digital business. We also have 2 banners, and the banners are connected. The life cycle of our product or a lot of it starts in the Nordstrom banner, and it ends up in the Rack. So there's a lot of choices for us to make in pricing and placement of that inventory, and we see opportunities to gain value in better managing product through its entire life cycle.So I would say the supply chain -- we really have a strong team in supply chain. And by leveraging them beyond the narrow laws of supply chain, really leveraging across the whole operational sides of our business, we see continued opportunities to drive productivity."", 'Operator', ""We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jamie Duies for closing remarks."", 'James Duies', ""Thank you for joining today's call. A replay, along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks, will be available for 1 year on our website.

""They point to a notable divergence between the views of the C-Suite and HR on what will carry business forward in 2024, and a lag in employees’ views on the impact of technology. As we usher in an age of human-machine teaming, organizations need to place people at the heart of transformation.""', 'Generative artificial intelligence (AI) viewed as key to increasing productivity', 'The rapid growth in generative AI capabilities has raised hopes for workforce productivity gains, with 40% of executives predicting AI will deliver gains of more than 30%. Yet, three in five (58%) believe tech is advancing faster than their firms can retrain workers, and less than half (47%) believe they can meet this year’s demand with their current talent model.', '""Raising productivity through AI is top of mind for executives but the answer does not lie in technology alone. Greater workforce productivity requires intentional, human-centric work design,"" said Kate Bravery, Mercer’s Global Talent Advisory Leader and author of the study. ""Leading companies recognize that AI is just part of the equation. They are taking a holistic view to address drains on productivity and deliver greater agility through new models of human-machine teaming.""', 'There are challenges in finding a sustainable path to the future of work. Three in four (74%) executives are concerned about their talent’s ability to pivot and less than a third (28%) of HR leaders are very confident they can make human-machine teaming a success. Key to greater agility is embracing skills-powered talent models, something high-growth companies have already mastered.', 'Employee trust has declined across the board', 'In 2023, trust in employers fell from an all-time high in 2022 – a red flag, since the research shows that trust has a major impact on employees’ energy, sense of thriving and intent to stay. Those who trust their employers to do the right thing for them and society are twice as likely to say they are thriving, with a strong sense of purpose, belonging and feeling valued.', 'Nearly half of employees say they want to work for an organization they can be proud of, and some companies are responding by prioritizing sustainability efforts and ""Good Work"" principles.

Three in four employees (76%) have witnessed age discrimination. As these challenges compound with ongoing skills shortages, greater attention around inclusion and meeting employees’ needs will help all employees thrive.', 'Resilience will be vital in the coming years', 'Recent investments in risk mitigation have paid off, with 64% of executives saying their business can withstand unforeseen challenges, up from 40% two years ago. Near-term concerns, such as inflation, heavily influence executives’ three-year plans, however longer-term risks, such as cyber and climate, may not be getting the necessary attention they deserve.', 'Building individual resilience is just as vital as enterprise resilience, with four out of five (82%) employees concerned that they will burn out this year.

(1) They recognize that human-centric productivity requires attention to how work is evolving and the skills and motivations of those doing the work. (2) They appreciate that trust is the true dialogue of work, fortified through transparency and equitable work practices.

I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and 2024 operating expectations, and followed by Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, who'll give some color on our capital allocation activities in the transactions markets. And then finally, Bob Garechana, our CFO, will review our 2024 guidance and our balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which was in-line with our October expectations. Our performance in 2023 was supported by a strong employment situation, more than 2.7 million new jobs created."", 'And while the 2024 outlook for overall jobs is more muted, we should benefit from a continued low unemployment rate for the college educated, which currently sits around 2.1%, as well as continued good real wage growth. We will also benefit in 2024 from having low exposure to new supply in the vast majority of our markets, particularly when compared to the Sunbelt markets, as well as the customer comfortably able to pay our rents with current rent income levels at about 20%. Overall, with low unemployment and rising real wages, our target renter demographic remains in good shape. They are likely to rent with us longer as the prospect of homeownership in the near-term seems less likely with scarce inventory and relatively high mortgage rates.', 'Less than 8% of our residents who moved out gave bought home as a reason to depart in 2023, which is the lowest we have seen since we started tracking the number. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across our country sets us up for good long-term demand. Drilling down on the West Coast, we do see clear signs of improvement in quality of life and energy on the street in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. We continue to believe a recovery in rental rates in the downtown submarkets of these metros is coming and expect our shareholders will benefit from catch up rental growth in these places, where rents are still at or a fair bit below 2019 levels and where incomes, both on a nominal and real basis, have risen substantially since 2019.', ""So, while we have not baked the material improvement in Seattle and San Francisco performance in our 2024 guidance expectations, we do note that other urban centers damaged by the pandemic and other negative trends, for example, New York City, reignited quickly and sharply off of depressed rent levels once quality of life and employment conditions improved. Switching to the cost side of the equation, our consistent ability to grow expenses and overhead more slowly than our competitors. We'll preserve cash flow for our shareholders as rent growth slows across the country and positions us well once growth picks back up. As it relates to capital allocation, before Alec, goes through the details of our recent transaction activities and our view of forward market conditions, I do want to highlight that we bought back some of our stock in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years."", ""We bought back a little more than 864,000 EQR common shares for a total of about $49 million spent at about $57 per share. We funded this repurchase activity with proceeds from sales during January of less desirable assets that were on average 40 years old and we're sold at a 5.6% disposition yield and believe that at this stock price and funded with these disposition proceeds, buying our shares makes a very good investment, especially given the lack of available assets to acquire at reasonable prices. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank our teams across the company for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and producing strong results for our shareholders. Now I'll turn call over to Michael Manelis."", 'Michael L. Manelis: Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2023 operating performance and our outlook for 2024. We produced same store revenue growth of 3.9% and same store expense growth of only 1.3% in the fourth quarter, both of which were in-line with our expectations. On the expense side, our low growth in the quarter and full-year 4.3% growth were helped by modest property tax cost as well as the savings produced as we continue to roll out initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies and a seamless customer experience. On the revenue side, the momentum in December was a little better than we thought as sequentially we grew revenue in the fourth quarter by holding onto more occupancy, while maintaining positive blended rate growth.', 'This set us up for a good start in 2024. Demand was solid across our markets and consistent with seasonal expectations. We finished the year with same store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points. These healthy fundamentals led to outstanding revenue growth in our East Coast markets and good growth in Southern California. As has been the case all year, the East Coast markets outperform the West Coast and by and large will likely continue to do so in 2024.', 'As you saw in our earnings release, we have provided 2024 same store revenue guidance range of up 2% to 3%. The building blocks for this growth starts with embedded growth of 1.4% and a midpoint assumption that both physical occupancy and cash concessions remain consistent with that of 2023. We expect the year to follow the traditional pre-COVID historical patterns with rent growth sequentially picking up in the spring and likely peaking in August. Our midpoint assumes renewals for the year averaged just over 4%. New lease change is relatively flat, which together produces blended rate growth of about 2%. This is more modest growth than the 2023 full-year blended rate growth of 3.1% and is reflective of a slowing job growth environment offset by a mostly positive supply situation in our coastal market, where we have about 95% of our NOI.', 'As you can see from the stats in the release, January is starting out the way we would expect with new lease change improving, a strong percent of residents renewing, and a renewal rate achieved that is healthy, albeit moderating a bit. While still early, all of these January trends support our outlook for the year, which includes a view that resident retention remains very good, as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. Orange County, San Diego, Boston, and Washington DC will lead the pack with expected revenue growth of approximately 4%.', 'New York and LA will follow closely behind. At the moment, we expect slightly positive same store revenue growth in San Francisco and Seattle, and in our expansion markets, which reflect only about 5.5% percent of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same store revenue growth given the unprecedented levels of supply being delivered. As we look to the individual markets, starting with Boston, with high occupancy and limited new competitive supply. This market should continue to perform well in 2024. The market is supported by a strong employment base and finance, tech, life science, health and education. New supply deliveries will be about the same this year as they were in 2023, and this is a market where our urban assets have outperformed suburban ones lately and we expect that trend to continue in 2024.', ""New York should continue to perform well this year, but won't reach the high rate growth achieved over the last few years. Occupancies remain high and competitive new supply is limited, which led to record high market rents, causing some rate fatigue to be observed in late in '23. New supply deliveries will be similar to last year with very little being delivered in Manhattan, where a large part of our portfolio is located. Washington DC continues to outperform our expectations despite the delivery of a good amount of new supply. The market delivered over 13,000 units in 2023 and saw the great majority of those units absorbed. This year, the market will see a similar amount of deliveries, but demand has been strong and we expect this good performance to continue."", 'We are starting the year with occupancies above 97%, which is a great position to be in. In Los Angeles, we expect the tailwind to growth as we work through the delinquency and bad debt issues that have been concentrated here. We continue to make progress, although the court system remains slow, taking at least six months from our court filing to being able to get the unit back. Bob will give some more color on the impact of bad debt net on our 2024 earnings expectations. New supply deliveries will be slightly higher this year with our Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and San Fernando Valley portfolio seeing the largest impact from this new supply. Strong retention and solid demand will continue to aid our ability to fill vacant units with paying residents in this market.', 'Rounding out Southern California, San Diego, and Orange County should be some of our highest growth markets this year, driven by high occupancies and a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets a more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year. In San Francisco and Seattle, we had little to no pricing power throughout 2023 and our base case expectations for this year assume that situation continues. We have seen periods of stability and then pullbacks. Concession use in both markets is widespread. We have strong physical occupancy with both markets being above 96%, which tells us there is demand, although it is very price sensitive.', 'As Mark mentioned, the downtown areas of both markets continue to see improvement in the quality of life, but are still lacking the catalyst of return to office and or job growth. New supply in San Francisco this year will be up from last year levels, mostly due to an increase in the South Bay, although continued healthy demand in this submarket should aid the absorption. Seattle is likely to be the most impacted of any of our markets when it comes to new supply deliveries with increases in both the City of Seattle and the Eastside. The lack of expected job growth combined with this new supply has driven our low expectations in Seattle for 2024. Both Seattle and San Francisco continue to see less than normal inbound migration. Seattle in the fourth quarter, however, did see some relative improvement with new residents coming to us from out of state.', 'This positive trend is something that we will keep an eye on as we move through the spring leasing season. Drawing new residents back to the MSAs in both Seattle and San Francisco would be a catalyst for these markets to outperform our expectations. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remained positive. That said, high levels of new supply are already pressuring rents and is likely to continue throughout 2024. At present, we are operating from a defensive position and starting the year with occupancies that are two to three percentage points above the market averages. Denver has demonstrated the most stability despite having limited pricing power in the portfolio, and we expect the market to produce slightly positive same store revenue growth in 2024.', 'Currently, Atlanta is using the least demonic concessions, but we expect a few of our assets to be very challenged due to the sheer number of lease ups in close proximity, which will likely lead to negative revenue growth for the year. In Texas, Dallas and Austin have widespread concession use, and we expect all of our assets to experience direct pressure from new deliveries all year long, resulting in negative same store revenue growth in these markets. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall same store revenue outlook for 2024, right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets and Southern California, which collectively is almost 70% of our NOI. We expect our coastal existing markets to outperform our expansion markets where unprecedented supply will impact operations near-term.', ""On the initiative side, in 2024, we will continue to focus on producing operating efficiencies and driving other income with projects tied to flexible living options, parking, renter's insurance, and monetizing technology deployed for the benefits of our residents. We are almost complete with the rollout of smart home technology across our portfolio, which will create further opportunities to share teams across properties and enable additional self-service options for residents. This, along with other ancillary income, should lead to total other income growth of 30 basis points excluding bad debt. As we sit here today, we like our positioning and look forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year."", 'I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to Alec, to walk through our capital allocation activities and the transaction market.', 'Alexander Brackenridge: Thank you, Michael. Despite an unsettled transactions market, we remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin and Denver and expect to see more opportunities to do so as the year progresses. As we underwrite potential acquisitions, we are always mindful of heightened levels of supply pressuring rents in our expansion markets and reflect tempered rent growth and concessions as needed in our projections. Currently, the transaction market remains unusually choppy with volumes down 60% to 70% compared to 2022 and down 40% to 50% compared to a more typical year like 2019. Nonetheless pressures on sellers to transact continue to mount as does the volume of new developments being delivered in these markets.', ""New developments in particular are often not capitalized to be held for the long-term, and even with rates decreasing over the last few months, carry costs are high. Owners of stabilized assets will also see pressure to transact, as loans mature and extensions that were agreed to with lenders last year expire. Despite the short-term operating challenges in our expansion markets, we remain committed to broadening our footprint in markets that will see strong job growth and household formations over time and lower regulatory risks. As regards our own transactions activity, we didn't acquire any assets in the fourth quarter, but we did sell three, a small property in Seattle, one in the Bay area and one in LA. On average, the properties were 40 years old and total sales proceeds were $185 million at an average 5.8% disposition yield."", ""While transaction volume overall is very light, we are seeing some opportunities to lighten the load of non-core older assets primarily in our West Coast markets. Since the beginning of 2024, we've sold two additional properties, one in Southern California and a small deal in Boston for a total of $189 million at an average 5.6% disposition yield. We've allocated a portion of the capital from these sales to the share buyback activity Mark just mentioned. With ample access to capital either through asset sales or debt issuance and a property management presence in our expansion markets, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In terms of anticipated volume, our guidance for 2024 is $1 billion for both acquisitions and dispositions, but market conditions will dictate whether we can hit or even exceed these goals."", ""Turning to development, in 2024, will complete six new apartment properties with a total cost expected to be $624 million and consisting of 1,982 units with lease ups commencing for two of those projects in Q1 and four in Q2. Three of those lease ups all through our joint venture program with Toll Brothers are in Dallas, while the remaining three, two in Denver and one in suburban New York City are JVs with other developers. Given the timing for completion and lease up, we don't expect meaningful contribution to NFFO growth in 2024, but would expect these projects to contribute more to 2025 growth. While our suburban New York project will see limited competition from new supply, not unexpectedly our lease ups in Dallas and Denver will see substantial new competition."", ""We acknowledge that the competition may be challenging and anticipate as we may have to adjust pricing and concessions to meet the market, our projected stabilized yields, which at initial underwriting were on average a mid six maybe closer to six. We believe these lease ups once stabilized and past the current supply glut will provide good cash flow growth and be solid long-term investments. Beyond these deliveries, we will be very selective about starting any new projects with a primary focus on locations where it's hard to buy such as suburban Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Bob."", ""Robert A. Garechana: Thanks, Alec. As Michael and Mark mentioned, 2023 ended up right in-line with our forecast last quarter. So, let's get right to guidance. Michael gave you most of the building blocks for same store revenue, but I'll finish up with bad debt, walk through drivers of same store expenses and normalized FFO and conclude with the balance sheet. In 2023, we were able to reduce bad debt significantly once the regulatory environment became more constructive. While we continue to work with non-paying residents, as we have during and after the pandemic, ultimately, we still ended up processing a high volume of skips and evicts. In fact, about 1.5 times pre-pandemic activity levels, which coupled with not adding significant amounts of new non-paying residents, helped us reduce bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue from well over 2% to just under 1.5%."", ""So, great progress overall, but still a long way from the 50 basis points we were accustomed to pre-pandemic. Much like last year, we expect 2024 to continue to show improvement. We also expect the pace of this improvement to be dependent on the speed of the court systems, primarily in Southern California, where delinquency remains highest, to quickly process evictions, which is a hard thing to predict. As a result, our guidance assumes that 2024 remains another transition year for bad debt and that we don't get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, our guidance midpoint assumes that full-year bad debt as a percentage of same store residential revenue is slightly above 1% or a 30 basis point contribution to 2024 growth overall. If that plays out, by the end of 2024, we would expect to be a little under two times pre-pandemic levels."", 'Turning to expenses. Expense management is core strength at Equity Residential as evidenced by the historical performance Mark referenced. Our same store expense guidance of 4% is also reflective of that discipline. This year, the individual drivers of growth are a little different than those from 2023. So, let me give you a high level assessment, and we can get into more detail in Q&A if required. In 2024, we expect real estate taxes and utilities to grow faster than they did in 2023, in part due to some 421-A step ups and commodity prices, while payroll and repairs and maintenance should be slower due to various initiatives and an expected normalization of inflationary pressures. Insurance, a small category at less than 5% of total expenses, but a topic often discussed should grow more slowly than last year, but remain above the long-term trend with growth in the low-double-digits.', ""Turning to normalized FFO, Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. As is typical, same store NOI performance is the primary driver of growth, but let me provide some color on transaction activity. We are assuming $1 billion in both acquisitions and dispositions for 2024 with limited dilution, yet we show a $0.03 reduction in normalized FFO growth there. This is due to our assumption that our acquisition activity mostly occurs later in the year than our dispositions. This is also partially offset in interest expense and interest income as disposition proceeds are used to pay down debt or invested in interest bearing 1031 accounts while we await acquisitions. Now a very brief comment on the balance sheet, because we're in really great shape here."", ""We have no debt maturities until the middle of 2025, modest outstanding balances on our commercial paper program and less than 10% floating rate debt. So, we're very well-positioned. In fact, over 50% of our existing debt doesn't mature until after 2030. The work we've done over the last number of years has reduced our interest rate exposure and allows us for ample debt capacity to run and grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator."", 'See also 15 Best Low Cost Stocks To Buy Under $75 and 11 Highest Quality Caviars in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

If you want to skip our discussion about interest rates and corporate debt, go to the 9 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2024.\xa0', ""Interest rates are expected to go down this year, but the Federal Reserve recently indicated that it will be a while before that happens. The Fed President, Raphael Bostic recently highlighted that the risk of inflation may get stuck above the central bank's 2.1% target. He said that it will likely be appropriate for the Fed to approve two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of this year. Currently, interest rates in the United States are at a twenty-year high of 5.25%-5.50%.\xa0"", 'The interest rates were increased as a response to rising prices post-Covid. By doing this, the Fed controls the money supply in the economy, thereby gaining some control over inflation. However, the high interest rates are bad news for corporate America.\xa0', ""Many fast-growing companies prefer to use debt to support their higher growth rather than equity. Debt is arguably less expensive for these companies as the rate of growth of business equity value is often greater than the borrowing cost of debt. However, as the interest rates get higher, the gap between the borrowing cost and the rate of growth of equity becomes narrower. Many fast-growing companies also prefer debt because loans do not provide an ownership stake. It also prevents the dilution of the owner's equity position in the business.\xa0"", 'Fast-growing companies, however, are not the only businesses that use debt. Many businesses use debt for their leverage. Debt provides a way to consistently build equity value for the shareholders. In addition, interest payments on loans are treated as expenses and deducted from revenue, thereby resulting in lower taxes.\xa0', ""Despite all the benefits of debt, the most indebted companies in the world are financial institutions. We saw a similar trend in our companies with the most cash reserves article, where an overwhelming majority were financial institutions. These institutions, particularly banks, rely on borrowing money as their business model. The bank's spread (the difference between the rate at which it borrows and lends) is an essential tool for its profitability.\xa0"", 'Despite the high-interest rates, there is still significant borrowing in the US. There seems to be an endless demand for top-rated corporate debt in the country, which has created an unease among some investors. There is also a concern that liquidity conditions could worsen this year, as so far this year, investment-grade US companies have raised a record amount of debt.\xa0', 'According to S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) corporate debt defaults increased by 80% in 2023. There is a strong likelihood that defaults will remain high this year too. As per S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) the number of companies that failed to make required payments on their debt totaled 153 for 2023, up from 85 in 2022. In 2024, S&P Global, Inc.

Technology stocks, in my opinion, are highly subject to speculation and associated volatility as a result. However, over extended holding periods, really exceptional businesses in the technology industry tend to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500 significantly. My research indicates Salesforce is one such company. As such, I will be holding it for a very long time and am comfortable weathering any short-term volatility as a result of a premium valuation as I believe this will get canceled out in decades of growth and market expansion.', 'Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff said in the recent earnings release:', '""With our trusted, unified Einstein 1 Platform, we\'re incredibly well positioned to build on our success and capitalize on the massive surge in tech spending expected over the coming years, delivering an unprecedented level of intelligence to our customers as AI transforms every company and industry.""', ""Salesforce's Einstein 1 Platform is a comprehensive solution for businesses to improve data aggregation, efficiency and security in operations.

Indeed, the valuation could be better, but over the long term, any short-term depreciation could be relatively irrelevant.

For example, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has a significant stake in the CRM and cloud computing markets. Still, Salesforce has strategically partnered with Alibaba, giving it the exclusive rights to offer its suite of services in China. However, this does not stop new startups in China from potentially innovating and capturing a market that is relatively small for Salesforce in comparison to its American presence.', 'I expect to increase my stake in Salesforce over time, and I consider it an exceptional business with a relatively wide moat in AI CRM.

CROX has been performing well on the bourses, thanks to its robust business strategies.

In fourth-quarter 2023, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 15th consecutive time.Driven by such upsides, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 17.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.7% growth. Analysts seem quite optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $4.1 billion and $12.38, respectively. These estimates show corresponding growth of 3.9% and 2.9% year over year. A VGM Score of A further adds strength.', 'Crocs has been seeing strength in clogs, sandals and personalization for a while now. Each of the three categories grew double digits during 2023.

This business increased 17% to more than $0.25 billion, accounting for roughly 9% of the total mix in 2023.Management continues to view personalization as a mega-consumer trend, with the opportunity of expanding the Jibbitz penetration in 2024 via better wholesale execution, deeper international penetration and advanced speed to market capabilities.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Crocs has been witnessing a decline in inbound freight costs, which have been contributing to gross margins for quite some time now. Also, favorable ocean freight rates, the absence of air freight and lower promotional activity in the Crocs brand have been acting as tailwinds.In fourth-quarter 2023, the adjusted gross profit rose 6.1% year over year, while the adjusted gross margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) to 55.7%, owing to gains from lower freight costs across both brands. Crocs brand’s adjusted gross margin grew 340 bps year over year. This increase is attributable to roughly 240 bps of freight tailwinds, higher international pricing, and favorable promotions and customer mix.Such factors make us optimistic about the future. For the year, the company anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of 3-5% at constant currency. Revenues for the Crocs brand are expected to rise 4-6% backed by the international business, while the metric for the HEYDUDE brand is forecast to be flat to slightly up for 2024.

On the flip side, even the largest tech stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tend to focus on growth at all costs while trading at higher multiples than typically seen in value stocks. Even tech stocks offering dividends, a hallmark of value investing, tend to devote less capital to the initiative than they do to growth and have expectedly low yields as a result. For example, Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) recently announced dividend represents a meager 0.41% yield, and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn’t much better at 0.53%.', 'But these value tech stocks buck the trend while straddling the fine lines between maturity, expansion, innovation and reliance on existing revenue drivers. Each is dominant in their respective fields but, not content to rest on their laurels. Each is also aggressively expanding while exploring new income opportunities.', 'Finding a legacy media stock like News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) on a list of value tech stocks seems counterintuitive. Legacy media sources, like newspapers, books and cable television, were once News Corp’s bread and butter. But today, Americans are increasingly moving toward next-gen media consumption. In a surprising move, NWSA is one of the few legacy media stocks effectively navigating the transition, unlike, say, Warner Bros Discovery’s (NASDAQ:WBD) ill-fated HBO Max transition.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be fair, some of the pressure forcing NWSA’s adaptation is the recent inclusion of activist investor firm Starboard Value snagging a “sizable” stake in the company. Since then, NWSA added 3% to quarterly revenue year-over-year and a whopping 94% to net income. CEO Robert Thomson attributes the improved top- and bottom-line stats to “our strategic shift to digital and subscription revenues, and away from sometimes volatile advertising revenues.” In effect, NWSA follows the lead that many software-based value tech stocks set when prioritizing recurring revenue (at a seemingly lower price point) over a one-time or intermittent larger payoff. In this case, NWSA is swapping digital subscriptions for high-spend ad accounts, just as value tech stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) charge users a few bucks monthly for Photoshop rather than hundreds upfront.', 'Thus far, the strategy is paying off as the company also focuses on more niche markets, including top-performing segments like Dow Jones and its range of digital real estate services. NWSA is reducing its emphasis on dividends, for now, as it right-sizes operations to adapt to changing trends, but the company still offers a modest 1.55% total yield.', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stands out among the top value tech stocks because, in many ways, it embodies the apparent contradiction between “value” and “tech.” The company, a member of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100, is one of the stablest and largest medical hardware manufacturers. But, whereas competitors tend to offer a steady but boring suite of medical hardware, ISRG brings robotics and automation to the operating room in an aggressively high-tech, high-growth business model.', 'ISRG is accelerating its global expansion as post-pandemic fatigue wears off within the wider healthcare ecosystem. The last quarterly report saw global da Vinci procedures (ISRG’s proprietary robotic surgery platform) grow 21% year-over-year (YoY), and new da Vinci installations grow 14%. But, reinforcing the value thesis, ISRG also reported a 17% sales bump and nearly doubled net income to $606 million from $325 million.', 'Investors should keep an eye on this value tech stock as management hopes to release its next-gen da Vinci platform sometime this year that boasts “10,000 times the processing power to gather data, improve sensing and deliver better digital and analytic performance [compared to current models]” according to CEO Gary Guthart.', 'Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY,OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is one of those rare value tech stocks with solid financials, an unassailable customer base and a massive range of untapped moneymaking opportunities. The Japanese stock is already on a record run, returning 50% over the past year despite a slowdown in recent weeks after alleged delayed hardware delivery timelines. But the slight slump won’t last long and, practically speaking, represents a great opportunity to jump in before the next leg up.', 'Bullish rumors continue swirling around Nintendo stock, including last year’s rumored Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) collaboration to build tomorrow’s virtual reality headset, as well as revelations that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seriously considered acquiring the Japanese game maker. But rumors and innuendo aside, plenty is propping up Nintendo’s value tech stock momentum.', 'Most notably, after The Super Mario Bros Movie shocked box offices last year with $1.4 billion in ticket sales, Nintendo is finally opening up its massive, 193-property strong IP catalog to franchising and monetization. First up is a silver-screen Zelda adaptation that could easily dwarf Mario’s performance.

However, significant differences exist as well. For example, Wall Street and the biggest AI winners thus far are already proven companies with massive cash hoards and well-established businesses like Microsoft and Alphabet.', 'At the same time, the AI buildout has buoyed the stock prices of these companies and led to robust earnings, it’s difficult to move the needle on a multi-trillion-dollar business like GOOGL or MSFT. Furthermore, many of these companies have broad and diverse businesses that stretch beyond AI.', 'Several data points suggest that the AI boom is in its 1995 moment rather than its 1999 moment. For instance, stock valuations are relatively inexpensive (at least compared to 99’), and the Nasdaq 100 ETF is just now breaking out to all-time highs. Still, the most significant divergence between then and now is the IPO market. In 2023, there were 154 IPOs on the U.S. stock market. Conversely, in 1999, a staggering 473 IPOs went public. Quite the difference!', 'IPOs, or Initial Public Offerings, serve as the lifeblood of the stock market by infusing it with new, publicly traded companies. These offerings provide opportunities for investors to buy shares in promising, often innovative enterprises, fostering market growth. In the late 1990s, the IPOs provided the most significant gains because many were agile, had blistering growth expectations, and were pure plays in the space.', 'Obviously, investors cannot change the fact that there are few pure-play AI avenues on Wall Street. Presently, they can invest in the aforementioned dominant big tech juggernauts.', 'Nevertheless, the best investors prepare for and study non-public companies ahead of time. They watch early-stage innovators early so that they fully understand the industry and can pounce when the opportunity comes.', 'An example of an AI start-up worth watching is Propense.ai. Today, Propense.ai announced a successful seed funding round. The Miami-based company combines AI technology with data science, user psychology, human behavior, and industry insights to anticipate client needs. Propense.ai streamlines the sales experience for accounting and legal professionals by providing them with highly probable cross-selling recommendations for existing customers, making it the first platform of its kind to maximize revenue opportunities for professional services firms.', 'In recent comments, Propense.ai CEO and Co-Founder Timothy Keith said,', '“The most successful professional service firms are actively engaged in adding service offerings to help their clients, but often struggle with educating their teams on when to offer new services. Propense.ai solves this challenge, elevating client satisfaction while also driving revenue. Behavior is one of the most difficult factors to change in the workplace, especially when sales professionals are expected to cross-sell services they don’t understand nearly as well as their core lines of business. That’s where Propense.ai and its revenue automation capabilities come into play. Using generative AI, accounting and legal professionals can propel new revenue by anticipating and supporting their client’s needs ahead of time.”', 'The best ideas are ones that solve issues. Propense.ai is an example of a company that solves the issue of employee education while adding efficiency and revenue growth. Though the company is still young, it already counts public companies such as public consulting juggernaut CBIZ as clients.', 'While the AI buildout is in motion, Wall Street and the AI industry have yet to experience the IPO frenzy that took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. Though many private AI start-ups still need to be bigger to enter public markets, I expect that will change in the coming years. In the interim, investors should take the time to investigate and study up-and-coming AI companies such as Propense.ai to educate themselves about the industry and prepare for the eventual influx of IPOs. These IPOs will likely provide the best opportunities because of their industry tailwind, high-growth potential, and asymmetric investment potential.', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

According to FactSet earnings insights, with 79% of S&P 500 companies reporting, 75% have reported a positive earnings surprise.', 'Given this positive earnings backdrop, stocks could rocket higher in 2024.

Full-year operating revenue was $54.7 billion, increasing 20% compared to 2022. Free cash flow was $2 billion and EPS was $6.25. Thus, on a trailing multiple, DAL stock is a bargain at 6.6 times earnings.', 'That said, the stock is also cheap based on forward earnings. In their year-end results, management issued guidance forecasting $6 to $7 in EPS for 2024. Moreover, they expect free cash flow in the $3 to $4 billion range.', 'Given these robust fundamentals, Delta Airlines is one of the elite blue-chip stocks to buy today. The airline is renowned for its industry-leading operating performance. On that note, the company closed 2023 with an operating margin of 11.6%. Still, management expects more cost optimization in 2024.', 'With demand for international travel remaining robust, DAL stock has further upside.

Investors were riled by the fact that the move would affect Saudi’s offshore oil production, denting the company’s revenue. Considering that the oil services giant is a major player in offshore drilling, this news seemed like a setback.', 'However, taking things into perspective, this selloff makes Schlumberger one of the top elite blue-chip stocks to buy. Management sees no impact from this news and reaffirmed their fiscal year 2024 guidance. They also reiterated that it expects significant growth from Saudi Arabia in 2024.', 'Indeed, management expects a multi-year growth cycle in the Middle East to drive growth going forward. After all, global oil demand is still growing.

This helps optimize the length of treatment.', 'Participants in the BCI Registry Study include patients and doctors in this investigation. More than 3,000 individuals were enrolled in the study by the time it ended and they will be monitored for 10 years after their diagnosis.', 'The study finding implies that BCI has a crucial role in identifying women whose anti-estrogen therapy may be stopped after the first five years to prevent any negative consequences and toxicities related to prolonged treatment.', 'The finding emphasizes another crucial application of BCI, which is to identify women who would benefit from longer treatment to help prevent a potentially fatal metastatic recurrence. In the past, lengthier therapy might not have been advised based only on clinical and pathologic risk factors.', 'The study findings support the usefulness of the Breast Cancer Index test in clinical settings even further.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Netflix ', ""Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Netflix's EPS has grown 26% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Netflix is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.8 percentage points to 21%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth."", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Netflix's future profits."", ""Since Netflix has a market capitalisation of US$259b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$2.2b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.9% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Netflix's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Netflix's continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Netflix."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.

(NYSE:NOV) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.05 per share on the 28th of March. This means the annual payment will be 1.2% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average.', ' Check out our latest analysis for NOV ', ""If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Prior to this announcement, NOV's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. We think that cash flows should take priority over earnings, so this is definitely a worry for the dividend going forward."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 8.8%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 6.6%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.04, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.20. The dividend has fallen 81% over that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", ""Given that the track record hasn't been stellar, we really want to see earnings per share growing over time. NOV has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 59% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about NOV's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for NOV that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

They will each appeal to different types of investors, but they all offer very attractive stories today. Here's a quick look at each."", ""A lot of dividend investors will look at NextEra Energy's 3.7% dividend yield, which is roughly average for a utility, and move right on to the next investment. That would be a mistake if you like dividend growth, since NextEra has increased its dividend at a roughly 10% clip over the past decade. And that payment has been increased annually for nearly 30 years. The key here, however, is that the utility sector downturn has pushed NextEra's yield up to near the highest in a decade, suggesting the stock is on sale."", ""What you get if you buy NextEra is a unique combination of a boring regulated utility business (about 70% of the company) and a fast-growing clean-energy company (30%). And while rising rates may take the growth rate down a notch, the company is still projecting 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2026. That's a rapid clip in the utility sector, and it should keep the dividend on a solid upward path. Long-term dividend growth investors have an opportunity to add a great company at a reasonable price today, and that shouldn't be ignored."", 'Enterprise Products Partners operates one of the largest portfolios of midstream energy infrastructure in North America. It charges fees for the use of its assets, so the price of the oil and natural gas that flows through its pipelines, storage, processing, and transportation facilities is less important than demand. On that score, energy demand is expected to remain robust for decades to come, even as clean energy production increases thanks to a growing global population and rising living standards.', ""That's the underpinning of the story. But what makes it really exciting is the ultra-high 7.3% distribution yield on offer here. The distribution has been increased for 25 consecutive years. It's backed by an investment grade-rated balance sheet. And distributable cash flow covered the payment by a very healthy 1.7 times in 2023. To be fair, the yield will probably make up the vast majority of an investor's return here, but if you're trying to maximize your income stream, that probably won't bother you at all."", 'Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker has been a tough company to love for a couple of years. A series of debt-funded acquisitions, supply chain disruptions, and volatility surrounding the coronavirus pandemic pushed earnings materially lower in 2022 and again in 2023. But management has done a lot of heavy lifting in an effort to get the company back on track, including debt reduction, asset sales, and the streamlining of the company. In 2024, earnings should hit an inflection point and grow over 2023 levels.', ""The industrial company isn't out of the woods just yet, but as investors see positive momentum, Wall Street will probably start to take a more positive view of the stock. Meanwhile, this Dividend King is offering investors a historically high 3.6% dividend yield. If you can stomach buying a turnaround play, Stanley Black & Decker looks to be about to turn the corner earnings wise. There might not be much more time to buy it before other investors start to catch on to the improving business performance."", 'Few investors will want to buy each of the stocks on this list, because they all appeal to different types of investors. Dividend growth types will appreciate NextEra Energy, yield seekers will like Enterprise, and more aggressive investors willing to step into a turnaround story will probably find the likely earnings upturn at Stanley Black & Decker very exciting', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

If you would like to skip our discussion on the impact of climate change, you can go to the 5 Cloudiest Cities in the World.', 'Climate change is one of the most significant challenges of our time and is no longer a distant threat. The evidence supporting this claim is strong. 2023 was the hottest year on record, with the average global temperature being 2°C warmer than pre-industrial levels and 0.17°C higher than the previous highest value of 2016. This seemingly small increase translates to significant disruptions in weather patterns. A 2023 study revealed that heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, with their occurrence having doubled. Hence, collaborative efforts at international levels are needed for preventive measures and damage control.', 'The consequences of unchecked climate change are considerably dangerous. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities worldwide, with recent data estimating that over 400 million people could be displaced by 2100 if we continue on a business-as-usual trajectory. Additionally, climate change has increased the likelihood of heatwaves, made droughts 100 times more likely, doubled the probability of extreme fire weather, and made heavy rainfall 50 times more likely. Moreover, climate change has the potential to put approximately 80% of the population of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa at risk of facing food scarcity and can push millions of people into poverty. The crop failures and food and water shortages caused by climate change are also estimated to lead to a global loss of $5 trillion over a period of five years. In 2020, Europe experienced the highest number of sunshine hours since 1983, a phenomenon attributed to climate change. Despite this, the number of annual sunshine hours can be as low as 840 in the cloudiest cities of Europe. Research indicates that air temperature influences sunshine duration, suggesting potential impacts of climate change on both the least cloudy and cloudiest places on Earth.', 'You can also check out the 10 Countries That Will Disappear by 2050 here.', 'To limit the adverse impacts of climate change, the IPCC emphasizes the need for a rapid and substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This transition requires a multi-pronged approach, with a key focus on shifting towards cleaner renewable energy sources. This is because renewable energy sources produce electricity without releasing harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, mitigating their contribution to climate change. Therefore, the clean energy market is expanding rapidly. Global investment in the clean energy sector increased by approximately 50% between 2019 and 2023. The total investment reached $1.8 trillion in 2023. In the same period, the usage of five key energy technologies, namely solar, wind power, nuclear power, electric cars, and heat pumps, led to the avoidance of 25EJ of fossil fuel demand. This was equivalent to 5% of the total fossil fuel demand of 2023. Moreover, annual additions to clean energy capacity rose by 85% and 60% during 2023 for solar and wind sources, respectively. Major players operating in the renewable energy market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), and General Electric (NYSE:GE).', ""Here's what Matrix Asset Advisors said about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“During the quarter, we started a new position in\xa0NextEra Energy, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:NEE), the owner of Florida Power & Light (FPL), a regulated utility, and NextEra Energy Resources, the largest unregulated alternative power producer (wind, solar, battery) in the United States. FPL has benefitted from Florida’s population and business growth. In addition, Florida’s regulators have been business friendly and allowed the utility to raise rates, earn a good profit, and build out its infrastructure. As a result, NextEra has historically shown earnings and dividend growth above the Utility group average. On September 30, the current dividend yield was 3.3%.', 'NEE disclosed some business setbacks after our initial partial purchase, causing the stock price to decline further. We are very comfortable that they have a best-in-class franchise, and we are slowly continuing to build our position into the stock price weakness. We are upbeat about NextEra and the utility group in general after its poor performance this year.”', 'Janelle Lugge/Shutterstock.com', 'We compiled our list of the 20 cloudiest cities in the world by using the metric of sunshine duration and analyzing the average cloud cover. The sunshine duration calculates the total annual sunshine hours for each city and is a widely accepted measure that helps assess the level of sunniness or cloudiness in a given location.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for WEC Energy Group, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.056 = US$2.2b ÷ (US$44b - US$5.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, WEC Energy Group has an ROCE of 5.6%.

The company has employed 29% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 5.6%.

Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 20% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

No participants in the Biktarvy group had a viral load of more than 50 copies/mL at Week 24. Results of the secondary endpoint, as measured by the proportion of individuals with HIV-1 RNA < 50 c/mL at Week 24, showed that participants who switched to treatment with once-weekly islatravir and lenacapavir or continued Biktarvy both maintained comparable high rates of HIV suppression at Week 24 (94.2% v. 94.2%).', 'Grade 1 and 2 treatment-related-adverse events (TRAEs) reported in the islatravir and lenacapavir group included dry mouth and nausea (each 3.8%).

However, it requires research and high conviction to hold through the good and bad times. I have experienced the feeling of selling core portfolio stocks on a 15% to 20% market correction. Selling has invariably been a bad decision while holding has created wealth. The focus of this column is on timeless stocks that are buy-and-forget.', 'It’s worth noting that we live in a dynamic world from the perspective of technological advancements. While screening timeless stocks, it’s important to consider names that are investing in innovation. This might not be entirely true for sectors like energy or industrial commodities. However, in these sectors, I would look for companies that are ahead of the curve by investing in global decarbonization efforts.', 'Overall, the idea is to look for fundamentally strong stories with an innovation edge. In my view, the timeless stocks discussed will continue to beat index returns through the decade.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com', 'In the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a quality name for sustained value creation. Even with economic headwinds, CVX stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. Further, the stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.28%. Once global GDP growth accelerates on the back of possible rate cuts, I expect the stock to surge higher.', 'It’s worth noting that Chevron’s business is a cash flow machine. The Company’s oil assets have a low break-even. For 2023, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion. If oil trades above $80 per barrel, the annual OCF is likely to be more than $40 billion. This provides ample flexibility for capital investments, dividends, and share repurchases.', 'Besides investing aggressively in exploration, Chevron is also focused on green energy investment. This includes hydrogen, other renewable fuels, and carbon capture. It’s worth noting that the Company currently produces one million tons per year of hydrogen. Chevron also holds 75 patents related to hydrogen energy. This will support expansion and future development in this area.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/ex_artist', 'The value creation potential of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is underscored by the fact that in the last ten years, COST stock has delivered capital gains of 640%. I would look at accumulating the stock on corrections. Besides healthy capital gains, COST stock offers a dividend yield of 0.55% and I am bullish on healthy dividend growth in the coming years.', 'An important point to note is that the consumption sector is the backbone of U.S. economic growth. With retail spending being an important part of overall consumption spending, Costco is likely to continue witnessing growth. At the same time, the Company is pursuing international expansion. Markets like China can provide strong revenue growth support in the coming years.', 'It’s worth noting that Costco has 870 warehouses globally. However, 747 warehouses are in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. There is ample scope for warehouse expansion I emerging markets like China where the Company has only five warehouses. Another positive to note is that Costco reported membership fee of $4.7 billion for the last twelve months. As member households swell, recurring revenue will boost cash flows.', 'Source: askarim / Shutterstock', 'When talking about innovators in the technology sector, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) name has always been at the forefront. With innovation and a strong brand-pull, AAPL stock has created massive wealth for investors. In the last ten years, the capital gains from the stock have been 864%.', 'I expect value creation to be sustained in the form of capital and dividend gains. It’s worth noting that AAPL stock currently trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 27.8. Valuations are attractive and I expect a healthy rally from current levels. This makes it one of those timeless stocks to buy.', 'Recent news indicates that Apple has canceled its electric vehicle project. With intense competition, the decision seems to be appropriate. At the same time, Apple is likely to focus resources and investments towards the fast-growing generative AI sector. Any potential news of investment in this area can spark a meaningful rally for the stock.', 'I must mention here that Apple spent $30 billion on research and development last year. Bringing AI features to its devices might just be a small part of the plan to benefit from AI growth.', 'Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com', 'Global defense spending has been increasing on a sustained basis and touched record highs of $2.2 trillion for 2022. With heightened geopolitical tensions, it’s likely that defense spending will continue to increase.', 'It’s therefore important to hold a quality defense stock in the portfolio. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.6. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.93% and I believe that healthy dividend growth is likely throughout the decade.', 'It’s worth noting that as of Q4 2023, Lockheed Martin reported a record order backlog of $160.6 billion. Order intake has been robust and I expect the backlog to swell further. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For the current year, Lockheed expects free cash flow in the range of $6 to $6.3 billion. All in all, it’s one of those timeless stocks.', 'Lockheed Martin also continues to invest in next-generation defense technology. The areas of research include hypersonic solutions, next-generation interceptors, directed energy, among others. Innovation is likely to ensure that the Company grows at a steady pace.', 'Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com', 'Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) might not have created value in the last five years. I however believe that the next five years will be characterized by healthy capital and dividend gains. The investment-grade gold miner looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.6 and offers a dividend yield of 3.35%.', 'It’s worth noting that gold is trading above $2,000 an ounce. With the possibility of expansionary policies, I am bullish on the precious metal surging higher. Factors like geopolitical tensions and inflation will also support gold on the upside.', 'As gold trends higher, Newmont is likely to create value. The Company has a strong asset base with 128 million ounces of gold reserves and another 155 million ounces in resources. Further, the Company has 40Mt in copper reserves and resources.', 'I must mention here that Newmont reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion last year. If gold surges from current levels, there is a strong case for operating cash flows of more than $5 billion. This will provide flexibility for healthy dividend growth and aggressive capital investments.', 'Source: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.com', 'An interesting point to note is that Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock has trended higher by just 65% in the last five years. However, the stock is up by 18% in the last six months. In my view, the biopharmaceutical sector is undervalued and MRK stock is an attractive bet. My view is underscored by the point that MRK stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15 and offers a dividend yield of 2.39%.', 'One reason to like Merck is its deep pipeline of new molecular entities. Currently, more than 80 programs are in the second phase of clinical trials with 30 programs in phase three. As new drugs are launched in the next few years, growth is likely to be steady along with cash flow upside.', 'For 2023, Merck reported sales of $60.1 billion. The Company has guided for revenue in the range of $62.7 billion to $64.2 billion for the current year. Merck has also guided for capital investment of $18 billion through 2027 for manufacturing capacity expansion. This is in anticipation of an expanding product portfolio.', 'Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com', 'Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been lower amidst volatility in the recent past. However, investors should not forget that TSLA stock has surged by 1,100% in the last ten years. The investment has been a massive value creator. I further believe that Tesla will continue to create value over the next decade primarily due to two factors. This makes it one of those timeless stocks.', 'First, Tesla has always focused on innovation and that’s one factor that will keep the Company competitive. Further, the EV industry is still at an early growth stage. There is ample headroom for penetration globally. Tesla is among the companies that are likely to benefit.', 'Besides an attractive product line-up, I am bullish on Tesla’s low-cost cars. Last year, Elon Musk indicated that the Company’s next-generation vehicle platform will cut production cost to half. If this is achieved, Tesla is likely to see strong growth in deliveries in markets like India, and Indonesia, among others. Overall, I would not be surprised if TSLA stock surges by another 7x to 10x by the end of the decade.', 'On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While challenges like potential deposit declines, funding cost pressures, unrealized losses, commercial real estate exposures, and economic uncertainty persist, banks are expected to build capital. Regulatory changes proposed last year in terms of capital and resolution requirements may be finalized in 2024. The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain rates initially before considering cuts in mid-2024 is expected to result in a modest decline in deposits and incremental rises in funding costs in the first half of the year. Despite a dip in profitability, banks are projected to maintain good financial health, generating a return on common equity of 10%-11% and building capital through earnings retention. Although net interest income may decrease, asset quality pressure is anticipated to rise but remain manageable, given banks' pre-provision earnings positioning them well to absorb potential credit losses."", 'Around June 2024, banks are expected to adopt a cautious approach as the presidential election unfolds, potentially introducing new policies and regulations. With elevated interest rates and low stock prices, there is an increase in fund and deposit costs, putting pressure on bank earnings. The M&A market has significantly slowed down, but there are factors such as deposit flight, net interest margin growth, digital transformation, new product introductions, and geographic expansion plans that could fuel robust M&A activity. If an interest rate cut occurs in the 1st or 2nd quarter of 2024 and gains regulatory approval, the industry may witness a surge in M&A activity, as per KPMG.\xa0', ""The IMF anticipates a decline in global inflation to 5.2% in 2024, down from its peak of 8.7% in 2022. Despite signs of deceleration in the labor market and consumer spending in countries like the United States, inflation is predicted to remain above target rates globally. Central banks worldwide are expected to fine-tune their monetary policies in 2024. In the US, the federal funds rate is projected to stay elevated, potentially dropping in the second half of the year. The European Central Bank is expected to begin reducing interest rates, while the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada are expected to lower policy rates. The Bank of Japan, maintaining a near-zero policy rate, plans adjustments to its bond yield curve control schemes. However, overall, central banks' quantitative tightening measures are set to contract the global money supply, with the United States experiencing a notable decline in money supply, reminiscent of the 1930s."", 'Moreover, digital transformation remains a key focus for the banking sector, with ongoing investments directed towards enhancing customer service and updating technology platforms. In 2024, banks will persist in their efforts to make products digitally accessible and user-friendly, aiming to retain existing customers and attract new ones. Generative AI is gradually finding its place in banking, contributing to activities such as loan underwriting, risk forecasting, and providing personalized recommendations in customer service. According to IBM, in the realm of generative AI adoption among banking organizations, a substantial 86% are either in production or gearing up for implementation. Notably, 8% are employing a systematic approach, encompassing domains like client engagement, risk and compliance, information technology, and support functions.

We believe both have sticky deposit bases, best-in-class management teams, conservative balance sheets, and attractive valuations. In both cases, outside of absolute contagion/panic resulting in a run on their deposits (a very low probability tail risk), we view the impact on the businesses as more of an “earnings” event, not a “balance sheet” event. Zions and Schwab got caught up in the contagious fear around SVB’s collapse due to some optical similarities between their balance sheets (namely bonds carried at mark-to-market losses), and Zions being a West Coast regional bank. We believe the similarities largely end there. Zions has a much more diverse deposit base than SVB. We estimate that half of Zions’ deposit base are small and medium-sized business operating deposits, which have historically been quite stable and a competitive advantage. Nearly half of Zions’ deposits are FDIC-insured, and the bank has ample liquidity to meet outflows without selling its securities portfolio. Similarly, Schwab’s retail deposit base is very sticky. Over 80% of their customers’ cash is FDIC-insured, and the cash is spread across approximately 34 million brokerage accounts (average ~$10,000 in bank cash per account). Schwab has more balance sheet liquidity than deposits. In both cases, there appears to be a low risk of correlation among their respective client bases. Although there will likely be some profit headwinds that stem from this crisis, we viewed the large declines in these shares as overly punitive, and thus believe the risk/reward for each is increasingly attractive.

We're excited to share that, with initial support from the Wells Fargo Foundation, we are launching a new focus area that will bring evidence-based research to the intersections between housing and climate policy."", 'Some of the challenges motivating our work on climate are not far afield from the housing policy failures we have tackled (and will continue to address). For example, the predominance of single-family zoning in the United States has exacerbated both affordability and the climate crises.1 Our goal of pursuing solutions that advance social and racial equity are strongly aligned with a focus on climate: the consequences of both housing and climate policy failures fall disproportionately on people with low incomes and people of color. Not only are these households more vulnerable to climate disasters due to where they live and the conditions of the homes they can afford,2 they are also less likely to receive disaster recovery assistance.3 These households are likewise more vulnerable to chronic stressors exacerbated by climate change, such as heat and air pollution.4', 'But there is also the real risk that in the effort to respond to climate change, policy makers may make decisions that run counter to housing affordability and equity goals, when in fact what is needed are policies that advance progress on both fronts. Fragmented governance at the local, state, and federal scales contributes to poorly coordinated policies across housing and climate areas,5 which hamper their effectiveness and further pit climate and affordability goals in opposition to one another.', 'Research is needed to provide policy makers with better evidence to navigate these tensions between climate and housing policies, and to identify complementary solutions at all scales of government. For example:', 'To what extent does building infill housing in cities contribute to reducing emissions in their corresponding metropolitan regions? Can greater suburban housing density also be part of the solution set?', ""How can the existing housing stock be retrofitted to improve energy efficiency and eliminate reliance on fossil fuels, while at the same time ensuring that these efforts don't raise energy cost burdens or displace renters of color and low-income renters?"", 'How could federal climate disaster assistance programs be better designed to protect renters and people experiencing homelessness, while not losing sight of the need to address long-term housing inequities?', 'Our new ""Housing + Climate"" research area explores these topics and contributes to efforts to better align housing and climate policies. We\'ve already started: we have launched new research projects that will explore how California\'s housing policies can best advance its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. We are working with a coalition of community-based and environmental justice groups to better understand what is needed to advance equitable housing decarbonization strategies. We\'re also looking at how federal Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants can be leveraged to fund retrofitting and decarbonization of affordable housing. In 2024, our sister nonprofit, Terner Labs, is launching a new Builders Lab initiative, which will provide an opportunity to incubate innovative construction techniques and identify strategies to overcome regulatory and other barriers to implementation.', 'Neither the climate nor the housing crises are easy challenges to address: both are emblematic of ""wicked problems""6-complicated, evolving, and multiscalar-without simple answers but with high stakes if we get the answers wrong. Research can help guide necessary policies, but partnerships and collective action are similarly critical.', 'We invite your input as we undertake this work.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast.

This was partly negated by higher input costs, adverse currency rates and negative impact of acquisitions and divestitures.SG&A expenses of $203 million rose 9% year over year and 7% on an organic basis. The increase stemmed from higher compensation and benefit-related expenses. Advertising expenses increased 1% year over year to $143 million for the fiscal third quarter.

The size of the offering was increased by $50 million subsequent to the initial announcement of the offering. The Company also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes a 13-day option to purchase up to $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of additional notes.', 'The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions described below, with any remaining net proceeds of the Notes, together with the net proceeds from the concurrent offering of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 of the Company which also priced today, to be used (i) to refinance all of its outstanding 3.800% Senior Notes due 2024 (""2024 Notes"") and a portion of its 5.000% Senior Notes due 2025 (""2025 Notes""), (ii) to repay, repurchase or redeem a portion of its other outstanding indebtedness, (iii) to pay related fees and expenses and (iv) for general corporate purposes.', 'The sale of the Notes is expected to close on March 11, 2024, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.', 'The Notes and the related guarantees will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears.', 'The Notes will be convertible into cash, up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 47.9904 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $20.84 per share).

Car manufacturers worldwide are investing significant sums into battery-powered vehicles -- perhaps the bedrock of the green energy movement.', 'Moreover, the notion of self-driving cars has become increasingly more prominent among car manufacturers and tech companies alike. General Motors (NYSE: GM) has been trying to make inroads in self-driving technology for years. Most notably, the company acquired a majority stake in a start-up called Cruise back in 2016.', ""However, over the years, Cruise has been plagued with operational setbacks. Most recently, several public reports suggest that Cruise's valuation has been lowered by more than half."", ""Let's dig into why this is important news and how Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) could end up emerging as the biggest winner of all from GM's latest debacle."", ""Cruise is just one of many companies exploring autonomous driving technology. Alphabet has been exploring self-driving for years through its subsidiary, Waymo. Moreover, Tesla has long been considered the leader when it comes to self-driving vehicles. In fact, famed mutual fund investor Ron Baron has gone as far as to say the super-compute capability behind Tesla's autonomous driving unit, called Dojo, could be a $1 trillion business itself."", ""It's no wonder other investors, including Honda and Microsoft, have helped pour billions into Cruise. But while self-driving prospects are both intriguing and lucrative, Cruise has been no stranger to controversy."", 'More recently, toward the end of 2023, Cruise hit several bumps in the road. The company was forced to suspend operations in California following a collision between one of its robotaxis and a pedestrian. Shortly thereafter, the company halted operations in other markets across the U.S.', ""Following these operational hurdles, Cruise implemented a series of layoffs as the company continued to hemorrhage cash. And finally, the company's founder, Kyle Vogt, resigned amid all the mismanagement hoopla."", 'Generally speaking, when a company is exploring a new type of technology, leadership will often weigh the pros and cons of building internally versus exploring external alternatives. Namely, these alternatives typically come in the form of mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\xa0While M&A can definitely fast-track entrance into a new market, these deals often come with headaches, including integration efforts, cultural challenges, and unforeseen capital requirements.', 'When General Motors decided to invest in Cruise, my guess is that the company viewed this as a way to gain entry to self-driving technology without spending years on research and development. The benefits of accessing the autonomous driving market are obvious.', 'Should General Motors have demonstrated success in self-driving, the company would have been able to differentiate its legacy vehicle models in an entirely new way. Moreover, ride-hailing businesses, such as Uber and Lyft, or delivery services, like Amazon, Instacart, and DoorDash, would likely be eager to partner with General Motors, given the massive cost-savings opportunities robotaxis present.', 'The problem is that these ideas look great on paper but are monumentally difficult to execute.', 'Between 2022 and 2023, General Motors spent a whopping $5.7 billion on Cruise. So far, the investment does not appear to be paying off, as the self-driving subsidiary has generated $4.6 billion in operating losses for General Motors over the last two years.', ""Despite Cruise's $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, its current burn rate doesn't bode much confidence. Frankly, I see General Motors needing to inject far more capital into Cruise sooner rather than later."", ""The reported valuation drop in Cruise shouldn't inspire confidence for General Motors investors. While General Motors presents an interesting alternative to other electric vehicle (EV) and self-driving car opportunities, I think the company is rapidly falling behind in both areas. It seems General Motors miscalculated the sophistication of autonomous driving and tried to buy its way into the market."", ""By contrast, Tesla spent years reinvesting cash flow into the business as it remained steadfast in developing the most superior automobile technology on the market. While the timeline for Tesla's commercialized self-driving technology remains somewhat of an enigma, the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has teased that it could be here sooner than people think."", 'While management deserves some credit for identifying emerging growth areas, the problems at Cruise are exposing General Motors as just another car company with little (if any) real innovative edge. On the other hand, Tesla has proven it can develop industry-leading technology that consumers actually want.', ""Although Tesla is still very much a car company today, I am bullish that it will evolve into a more prolific technology operation in the coming years. As such, even though General Motors isn't giving up on self-driving entirely, I think investors are much better off as buyers of Tesla stock at this moment. The recent woes at Cruise are just another setback for an already beat-up operation, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more challenges ensue for General Motors."", 'In the long run, should Tesla succeed in its self-driving ambitions, the company will have an enormous opportunity to license this software to other car companies, similar to what it is already doing with its supercharger network. For this reason, I see Tesla emerging as the ultimate winner in the autonomous driving race and think the company has a multibillion-dollar opportunity in the palm of its hands.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Motors right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Motors, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Motors wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the aviation industry, head over to 5 Best Aviation Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\xa0', 'The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released its outlook for the airline industry in December last year, projecting a higher profitability trajectory for full-year 2023 with further stabilization anticipated in 2024. The overall aviation landscape in 2024 is expected to witness a notable increase in revenues, which will outweigh expenses. Industry revenues are forecasted to reach a historic high of $964 billion, fueled by a growth rate of 7.6%, while expenses are projected to rise at a slightly slower pace of 6.9%. This positive trajectory is expected to strengthen the profitability of the airline sector. Passenger revenues are a significant driver of this growth, anticipated to reach $717 billion in 2024, marking a 12% increase from the previous year. ', 'On the cargo front, revenues are projected to decline to $111 billion in 2024. This decrease is attributed to the impact of increased belly capacity on the passenger side of the business, coupled with stagnation in international trade. IATA listed down several factors that pose both positive and negative risks to the fragile profitability of the aviation industry. Global economic developments, including inflation, low unemployment rates, and demand for travel, are considered positive factors. However, economic strains in regions like China, if not managed properly, could impact global business cycles. Additionally, ongoing conflicts, such as the Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, have operational and cost implications for the industry, particularly in terms of oil prices.', 'Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, commented:\xa0', '“Considering the major losses of recent years, the $25.7 billion net profit expected in 2024 is a tribute to aviation’s resilience. People love to travel and that has helped airlines to come roaring back to pre-pandemic levels of connectivity. The speed of the recovery has been extraordinary; yet it also appears that the pandemic has cost aviation about four years of growth. From 2024 the outlook indicates that we can expect more normal growth patterns for both passenger and cargo. Industry profits must be put into proper perspective. While the recovery is impressive, a net profit margin of 2.7% is far below what investors in almost any other industry would accept. Of course, many airlines are doing better than that average, and many are struggling. But there is something to be learned from the fact that, on average airlines will retain just $5.45 for every passenger carried. That’s about enough to buy a basic ‘grande latte’ at a London Starbucks. But it is far too little to build a future that is resilient to shocks for a critical global industry on which 3.5% of GDP depends and from which 3.05 million people directly earn their livelihoods. Airlines will always compete ferociously for their customers, but they remain far too burdened by onerous regulation, fragmentation, high infrastructure costs and a supply chain populated with oligopolies.”', 'Fitch Ratings has a Neutral outlook for the global airline sector in 2024. Despite global traffic approaching pre-pandemic levels, it still lags behind historical trends. Fitch also observed Chinese international traffic is notably below 2019 levels but has potential for growth. Business travel, which faced challenges in 2023, is displaying signs of recovery. Additionally, full-service carriers are expected to sustain positive trends in premium products, experiencing notable growth post-pandemic.\xa0', ""The airline industry has been experiencing waves of M&A activity recently. Airline consolidation is a common and essential strategy for growth and competitiveness, as demonstrated by Alaska Airlines' announcement to acquire Hawaiian Airlines for $1.9 billion back in December 2023. This move is not just a business transaction but a strategic positioning for future growth in the highly competitive and concentrated airline sector.

Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Target after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Target ', ""Following last week's earnings report, Target's 30 analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$107.2b, approximately in line with the last 12 months.

The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""The consensus price target rose 14% to US$178, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Target, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$206 and the most bearish at US$132 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Target shareholders."", 'One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 0.2% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 8.6% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 4.5% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Target is expected to lag the wider industry.', 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Target following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.', ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Target analysts - going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You should always think about risks though.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

On the flip side, even the largest tech stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tend to focus on growth at all costs while trading at higher multiples than typically seen in value stocks. Even tech stocks offering dividends, a hallmark of value investing, tend to devote less capital to the initiative than they do to growth and have expectedly low yields as a result. For example, Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) recently announced dividend represents a meager 0.41% yield, and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn’t much better at 0.53%.', 'But these value tech stocks buck the trend while straddling the fine lines between maturity, expansion, innovation and reliance on existing revenue drivers. Each is dominant in their respective fields but, not content to rest on their laurels. Each is also aggressively expanding while exploring new income opportunities.', 'Finding a legacy media stock like News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) on a list of value tech stocks seems counterintuitive. Legacy media sources, like newspapers, books and cable television, were once News Corp’s bread and butter. But today, Americans are increasingly moving toward next-gen media consumption. In a surprising move, NWSA is one of the few legacy media stocks effectively navigating the transition, unlike, say, Warner Bros Discovery’s (NASDAQ:WBD) ill-fated HBO Max transition.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be fair, some of the pressure forcing NWSA’s adaptation is the recent inclusion of activist investor firm Starboard Value snagging a “sizable” stake in the company. Since then, NWSA added 3% to quarterly revenue year-over-year and a whopping 94% to net income. CEO Robert Thomson attributes the improved top- and bottom-line stats to “our strategic shift to digital and subscription revenues, and away from sometimes volatile advertising revenues.” In effect, NWSA follows the lead that many software-based value tech stocks set when prioritizing recurring revenue (at a seemingly lower price point) over a one-time or intermittent larger payoff. In this case, NWSA is swapping digital subscriptions for high-spend ad accounts, just as value tech stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) charge users a few bucks monthly for Photoshop rather than hundreds upfront.', 'Thus far, the strategy is paying off as the company also focuses on more niche markets, including top-performing segments like Dow Jones and its range of digital real estate services. NWSA is reducing its emphasis on dividends, for now, as it right-sizes operations to adapt to changing trends, but the company still offers a modest 1.55% total yield.', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stands out among the top value tech stocks because, in many ways, it embodies the apparent contradiction between “value” and “tech.” The company, a member of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100, is one of the stablest and largest medical hardware manufacturers. But, whereas competitors tend to offer a steady but boring suite of medical hardware, ISRG brings robotics and automation to the operating room in an aggressively high-tech, high-growth business model.', 'ISRG is accelerating its global expansion as post-pandemic fatigue wears off within the wider healthcare ecosystem. The last quarterly report saw global da Vinci procedures (ISRG’s proprietary robotic surgery platform) grow 21% year-over-year (YoY), and new da Vinci installations grow 14%. But, reinforcing the value thesis, ISRG also reported a 17% sales bump and nearly doubled net income to $606 million from $325 million.', 'Investors should keep an eye on this value tech stock as management hopes to release its next-gen da Vinci platform sometime this year that boasts “10,000 times the processing power to gather data, improve sensing and deliver better digital and analytic performance [compared to current models]” according to CEO Gary Guthart.', 'Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY,OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is one of those rare value tech stocks with solid financials, an unassailable customer base and a massive range of untapped moneymaking opportunities. The Japanese stock is already on a record run, returning 50% over the past year despite a slowdown in recent weeks after alleged delayed hardware delivery timelines. But the slight slump won’t last long and, practically speaking, represents a great opportunity to jump in before the next leg up.', 'Bullish rumors continue swirling around Nintendo stock, including last year’s rumored Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) collaboration to build tomorrow’s virtual reality headset, as well as revelations that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seriously considered acquiring the Japanese game maker. But rumors and innuendo aside, plenty is propping up Nintendo’s value tech stock momentum.', 'Most notably, after The Super Mario Bros Movie shocked box offices last year with $1.4 billion in ticket sales, Nintendo is finally opening up its massive, 193-property strong IP catalog to franchising and monetization. First up is a silver-screen Zelda adaptation that could easily dwarf Mario’s performance. If that’s the case, expect the floodwaters to open – and Nintendo stock to inch higher to the recent 11% price target upgrade by one analyst.', 'On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

CROX has been performing well on the bourses, thanks to its robust business strategies. The company has been gaining from solid consumer demand across the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands, backed by effective pricing actions. This has helped it experience impressive growth for a while now. In fourth-quarter 2023, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 15th consecutive time.Driven by such upsides, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 17.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.7% growth. Analysts seem quite optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $4.1 billion and $12.38, respectively. These estimates show corresponding growth of 3.9% and 2.9% year over year. A VGM Score of A further adds strength.', 'Crocs has been seeing strength in clogs, sandals and personalization for a while now. Each of the three categories grew double digits during 2023.

Also, favorable ocean freight rates, the absence of air freight and lower promotional activity in the Crocs brand have been acting as tailwinds.In fourth-quarter 2023, the adjusted gross profit rose 6.1% year over year, while the adjusted gross margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) to 55.7%, owing to gains from lower freight costs across both brands. Crocs brand’s adjusted gross margin grew 340 bps year over year. This increase is attributable to roughly 240 bps of freight tailwinds, higher international pricing, and favorable promotions and customer mix.Such factors make us optimistic about the future. For the year, the company anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of 3-5% at constant currency. Revenues for the Crocs brand are expected to rise 4-6% backed by the international business, while the metric for the HEYDUDE brand is forecast to be flat to slightly up for 2024. The adjusted operating margin is envisioned to be 25%. It anticipates gross margin improvement compared with 2023 at the enterprise level, with stable Crocs brand gross margin and HEYDUDE gross margin to rise for the year. Adjusted EPS is envisioned to be $12.05-$12.50, up from $10.92 recorded last year.To wrap up, Crocs seems to be a decent investment bet given all the aforementioned positives.', 'Some better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, Royal Caribbean RCL and lululemon athletica LULU.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and a growing disposable income.', ""3 Trends Shaping the Leisure & Recreation Services Industry's Future"", ""Concerns of Slowing Global Economy & High Inflation: The global economy is expected to suffer a downturn, which could negatively impact various industries. Inflation saw a higher-than-anticipated increase in January, disrupting Wall Street’s initial strong start to the year. According to the Labor Department, the consumer price index (CPI) experienced a month-on-month increase of 0.3% in January and a year-on-year increase of 3.1%, following a 3.4% increase in December. These figures surpassed economists' predictions, which were a 0.2% increase for the month and a 2.9% increase on an annual basis. Even though the annual inflation rate was slightly lower than the previous month, it remains significantly above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%."", ""Robust Demand Aids Cruise Operators: The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand for cruising and accelerating booking volumes. The industry is benefiting from solid bookings concerning North American and European sailings. Also, strong pricing (on closer-in-demand) and solid onboard spending bode well for the industry. According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the number of passengers embarking on cruises is projected to reach 35.7 million in 2024, suggesting an increase from 31.5 million in 2023. The projection calls for a 6% rise from the 2019 figures, reflecting the cruising industry’s upside.Theme Park Operators & Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back: The theme park industry has been benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks continues to rise. The theme park sector is experiencing a boost from integrating technology, particularly through augmented and virtual reality. By incorporating innovative motion simulators, hydraulics and pneumatics and centering on enhancing customer experiences, there's anticipation of a surge in market demand in the coming years. Recently, an increasing number of theme parks have started to weave advanced technology into their attractions and exhibits, aiming to elevate the overall experience.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2023 performance followed by our outlook for 2024. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings results that were well ahead of our expectations. Our above-plan sales were driven by our customers' positive response to the improved assortments of quality branded bargains throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, were $1.82, up from $1.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the period rose to $610 million versus $447 million last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew to $6 billion, driven by robust comparable store sales gain of 7%. For the 2023 fiscal year, earnings per share were $5.56, up from $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the fiscal 2023 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. Total sales for the year increased to $20.4 billion, up from $18.7 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2024, grew a solid 5%. As noted in our press release, the sales results for both the 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal year included a $308 million benefit from the 53rd week. Earnings per share for both periods also benefited from the extra week by approximately $0.20 per share. Fourth quarter operating margin grew 165 basis points to 12.4%, up from 10.7% in 2022. This improvement was mainly due to the strong gains in same-store sales and lower freight costs that were partially offset by higher incentives. The 53rd week also benefited operating margin by 80 basis points. Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, cosmetics, home and Children's were the best-performing merchandise areas, while geographic results were broad-based. Dd's discount sales trends slightly trailed Ross' growth. While dd's top line results were respectable in fiscal 2023, we are disappointed with the performance in newer markets. We are currently conducting an in-depth analysis of dd's to better understand and address the different wants and needs of their diverse customer base, particularly as we expand outside our current existing geographies. Until this work is completed, we believe it is wise over the near term to moderate dd's store growth in newer markets and focus new store openings, primarily in existing regions. Now let's turn to inventory. As we ended the quarter and the year, consolidated inventories were up 8%. Average store inventories were up 9% compared to 2022's holiday period due primarily to the 53rd week shift. Packaway represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. Regarding our store expansion program, we added 94 net new stores in 2023, including 71 Ross Stores, Ross Dress for Less and 23 dd's DISCOUNTS. We ended 2023 with 2,109 stores, including 1,764 Ross Dress for Less and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As we noted in today's release, for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million and 8.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $247 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022, which we have now completed as planned. Our Board of Directors also recently approved a new 2-year, $2.1 billion stock repurchase authorization or approximately $1.05 billion for each fiscal year. This new plan represents an 11% increase over the recently completed repurchase program. In addition, the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.3675 per share to be payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of business. Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2024."", 'Adam M. Orvos', ""Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose a strong 7% for the quarter, entirely driven by higher traffic and shoppers positive response to our improved assortments throughout our stores.As Barbara noted earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% was up 165 basis points from 10.7% in 2022 and included about an 80 basis point benefit from the 53rd week in 2023. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales improved by 265 basis points versus last year, benefiting from a combination of factors. Merchandise gross margin increased by 110 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Distribution costs declined by 75 basis points partially driven by favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy costs levered by 75 and 45 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying costs that increased 40 basis points, mainly from higher incentives. SG&A for the period delevered by 100 basis points, mostly driven by higher incentive costs and wages. Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024. As mentioned in our press release, we are encouraged by the sustained sales momentum that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the holiday season. That said, there remains ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments. In addition, while inflation has moderated, prices for necessities like housing, food and gasoline remain elevated and continue to pressure the low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend. While we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting our business in 2024. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, we are planning comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a solid 5% gain in 2023. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.89 compared to $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year compared to 53 weeks in 2023. As previously mentioned, our 2023 earnings per share benefited from an additional $0.20 of EPS from the extra week. Turning to our guidance assumptions for the 2024 year. Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 4% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, versus the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This year-over-year increase in total revenue is affected by last year's 53rd week, which added approximately $308 million to sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2023. If same-store sales perform in line with our plan, operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% compared to 11.3% last year, which benefited by 25 basis points from the 53rd week. This year-over-year change also includes the benefit of anniversarying higher incentive costs in 2023, given our outperformance. In addition, for fiscal 2024, we expect merchandise margins to be pressured as we plan to offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. For 2024, we expect to open approximately 90 new locations, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $143 million. Depreciation amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $610 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $332 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2024 are planned to be approximately $840 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business. Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. We are planning comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending May 4, 2024, to be up 2% to 3% versus a 1% gain in last year's first quarter. If sales perform in line with this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 to be $1.29 to $1.35 versus $1.09 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: total sales are planned to be up 6% to 8% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 11.1% to 11.4% compared to 10.1% last year. The expected increase mainly reflects our forecast for lower incentives and freight costs that are partially offset by lower merchandise margin and higher wages. We plan to add 18 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $44 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecasted to be about $335 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Thank you, Adam. To sum up, as Adam noted, while we hope to do better than our forecast this year, the external environment remains uncertain and our low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend continues to be impacted by elevated cost of living. Despite these headwinds last year, our shoppers responded positively to the strong values we offered across our stores which drove our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth throughout 2023. In 2024, we plan to build upon these efforts and offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. We believe the diligent execution of this plan will result in increased market share gains this year and in the future. At this point, we'd like to open the call and respond to any questions you may have."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.', 'Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson', 'Barbara, I was hoping to better understand the dynamic around the sharply priced brands and their impact on merchandise margins. How big of the -- how large of a percentage of the assortment were you planning to take down to these sharper price points? And is there other opportunity to improve on the gross margins through domestic freight or other line items as the year progresses?', 'Barbara Rentler', ""Sure, Lorraine. So let's just talk about the sharply priced brands. Obviously, I wouldn't talk about what type of penetration we're going to shift to. What I would say to you about the sharply priced brands is that during '23, we strengthened our value offerings. We kept saying that we were doing that, and we were doing that. And that really results in the acceleration of sales and started in Q2 and then persisted through the whole holiday season. And so that's really how we came up with in 2024, that we planned to build upon those successes that we had in '23 by offering more brands that are sharply priced to deliver that value proposition the customer wants. But what I would say to you also is it's a tiered strategy; a good, better, best strategy. So in terms of gross margin expansion from the pure merchandising side. What I would say to you is this strategy really -- we really believe that this will drive sales and it will drive market share. And that's really how we're looking at it. Because that's what the customer has voted on all year, and we feel like it's a strategy that's broad-based in the entire box. Certainly, there are some businesses that have more opportunities than others. But that's really how we came to this conclusion and the customer has been voting, and that's really what she's been voting on."", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', 'Lorraine, then on just the other margin opportunities from a freight standpoint, from a domestic freight standpoint, we do expect to see some improvement for the full year, but to a lesser extent than we saw last year.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', ""And congrats on another great quarter. So Barbara, I guess maybe could you elaborate on drivers that you think really were behind? I think this is the best fourth quarter performance in more than 10 years, if I exclude the pandemic. Maybe what you saw across categories, do you think that you're attracting a new customer? And maybe just the decision to raise your initial comp view for 2024 to the 2% to 3% relative to historical 1% to 2%? And then just one for Adam. Any change to bottom line flow-through in the model for 2024 as we think about incremental comp potential upside?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""It's Michael Hartshorn. Just on the customer overall. It's hard to see whether it's a new customer or the existing customer is spending more. What we did see is our performance, as we said in the commentary was broad-based across region, but it was broad-based really across all aspects of our business, including geographically, income levels and age."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""And in terms of -- Matthew, in terms of the drivers, the categories, the ones that I said, cosmetics, home and Children's were really the best, Accessories was slightly above the chain and apparel trailed the chain. But again, it performed above our plan. And I think part of the things that really drove it was we had a big push this year in home on gifting, and we added some new classifications and the customer responded."", 'Adam M. Orvos', ""Yes. And on the flow-through question, this is Adam. Nothing has changed. We expect EBIT margin flow-through of about 10 to 15 basis points for each additional point of above-plan sales. And with our guide of plus 2% to 3%. And on a 52-week basis, you see margin rate expansion. We're getting some benefit also this year of lower incentive costs based on our outperformance from 2023."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.', 'Mark R. Altschwager', ""Maybe first, Barbara, just any hypothesis on what might be driving the weaker-than-expected dd's performance in newer markets? And maybe comment also on how the Ross Dress for Less stores in newer markets have been performing relative to your expectations?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Just on -- I'll start with the Ross. The Ross new markets have been performing at or above our expectations. From a dd's standpoint, as we said in the commentary, the overall comp was just is slightly below Ross for both the quarter and the year. So while overall comps were respectable, we've been disappointed in the dd's new market performance. Our new markets tend to be more diverse based on ethnicity and income, and we clearly didn't satisfy them with the assortments we've been offering there."", 'Mark R. Altschwager', ""Maybe just a follow-up. Can you comment on the buying environment and any changes you're seeing? And how is that impacting the expectations for the merchandise margin pressure this year, if at all?"", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Well, I think it's a positive buying environment. I mean there's still merchandise in the market. And I've said this on calls before, there are some vendors that are very aggressive in bringing in inventory as they're trying to gain market share and then others, it's more normalized. In terms of merchant margin, our strategy now is really to continue to offer the customer really great value because that is really, really what's working sharp prices. And so even if you're buying some of these really great opportunities, we are really thinking about passing along really that potential savings to the customer because we really do believe that is the best way to drive market -- to gain market share. And so that's really how we're approaching it at this point, and that is what the customer is responding to."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.', 'Charles P. Grom', ""Great results. From a category perspective, which categories do you view is the biggest opportunities in 2024? And curious, separately what you're seeing on the shrink front in the quarter and what your expectations are for '24? A couple of retailers, including Target today have called out improving shrink results lately."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Sure. In terms of categories for '24, I mean, with the brand strategy we're putting in place, I feel like there's -- it's pretty broad-based the opportunity. But obviously, our apparel business has been trailing the chain. And so we're focused on really trying to improve those assortments and to get the apparel business more in line with the other businesses."", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Chuck, on the shrink front, I would say we're not immune to the external theft and organized crime environment throughout retail. We do continue to invest in initiatives to hold shortage at bay. For 2023, our shrink levels were in line with 2022. Our guidance assumes that shrink is up a bit. So that's built into the guidance, but we'll continue to make investments there to keep it in line."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""Congrats on a really nice holiday. And I apologize if you said it, but did you mention how much the extra week impacted the gross margin in the fourth quarter? I heard the operating margin, but just housekeeping on that. And then, I guess, maybe we could talk a little bit about how you built to the comp guidance for the year with the 2% to 3% comp in the first quarter and in the year? I guess, as the comparisons get a little tougher, I think it implies the 2-year accelerates a little bit as we move through the year. So maybe just a little bit on how you were thinking about that. I'm wondering if that's maybe the sharp price merchandise assortment strategy accelerating through the year. Anything you could point to help us think alongside you on that, please?"", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Sure. So from the merchandise strategy, we do expect it to accelerate as we go. Obviously, we've been building the strategy off of starting in Q2 of 2023. And now -- I would say now it's more broad-based than we were as we were coming across. Maybe the words I want to use is it's a little more intentional in certain businesses than it was before. And so we do expect that as we come across. We are expecting that our Apparel business as we move through the year will improve."", 'Adam M. Orvos', 'And Michael, on the 53rd week question, so we thought operating margin was worth 80 basis points in Q4 and about 25 for the year, and that was largely in gross margin versus SG&A.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.', 'Alexandra Ann Straton', ""Perfect. Super amazing [trend]. It looks like you guys are further closing the gap to pre-COVID EBIT with every passing quarter, even though fourth quarter still sits somewhat below. So can you just talk about what's hampering you from returning to the pre-COVID levels and how you think about recovering that gap from here? And then maybe Barbara, a big picture question for you. What are your key priorities for the year as you think about Ross?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Alex, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the long-term kind of what it's going to take to close the EBIT margin gap. Obviously, the biggest drivers are where wages and freight has been over the last couple of years. I would say over the long term, we can -- we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. As always, EBIT growth will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth. We believe the improvements we've made and continue to make to strengthen our value offerings will lead to market share gains in the long run. I'll also say we're investing in capabilities to drive efficiencies and related cost savings that we believe will contribute to profitability as well over time. As you can see in this year's guidance, our EBIT leverage is around 3% with double-digit EPS growth at the top end of that 2% to 3% range on a 52-week basis. Over the long term, we think we can get leverage in the 3% to 4% comp range."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""And in terms of priorities, our priority this year is really to gain market share through a diligent execution of the strategy. We've done a lot of work around what we believe we need to do to gain market share. And so on the Ross side, that really is mine and our key priority. And then on the dd's side to go off and to do some additional work, to understand that customer. So as we go into newer markets, we satisfy her needs."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.', 'Adrienne Eugenia Yih-Tennant', ""Great. And let me add my congratulations as well. Barbara, on the dd's, I was wondering if you could talk about sort of the new store strategy? Are you clustering them? What regions outside of California or is it within kind of the West Coast are seeing the differences? So any more detail on kind of your early thoughts on what's happening there other than sort of the broader demographic mix. And then Michael or Adam, on the transaction, can you talk about the fourth quarter, the holiday transaction growth versus the AUR component?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Adrienne, on dd's. So our real estate strategy for dd's is a little different than Ross. It's not as a clustered strategy, as you said, as we see for Ross. There is -- after you get outside of our core markets in Texas, Florida and California, they are, as I said, distinct ethnicity differences, which means we have to find the right assortment that's different from our core markets. We'll know more after we go through the customer research, and then we'll make -- start making the adjustments we think we need to improve performance there."", 'Adam M. Orvos', 'And Adrienne, on to your question on the components. Our 7% comp was all driven by traffic. Average basket was flat. So we had slightly higher AUR and slightly lower items per transaction.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.', 'Brooke Siler Roach', 'I was hoping you could elaborate on the assumptions embedded in your outlook for SG&A expense for the year. What are you assuming for wage and other investments? And what are you seeing in the wage environment currently?', 'Adam M. Orvos', ""I would say it's somewhat stabilized, Brooke. Really where we're taking wage increases is where the -- where we're required to by the minimum wage changes state by state. I would say from an SG&A standpoint, we'll get the benefit of anniversarying the higher incentive costs. And then, we've generally been able to do a good job while the minimum wage changes are putting pressure in the stores. Through some of the efficiencies that we've invested in, we've generally been able to offset that. So I'm not seeing much overall pressure on the store side on that front."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.', 'Irwin Bernard Boruchow', ""Michael, maybe to you, I think to answering your question earlier, you had said that you expect freight to be a benefit this year but less so than in '23. Were you referring to domestic freight specifically? Are you talking to freight, including ocean freight within the merchandise margin loan?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""In that one, I was talking about domestic freight, but I'll let Adam take it to speak on this."", 'Adam M. Orvos', ""Ike, this is Adam. So on the ocean freight side, we'll get a little bit of benefit in Q1, but kind of negligible over the course of the year. Obviously, this is going to be dependent on how the situation plays out in the Suez Canal. And the duration of that conflict if anything changes. But I would also say that impacts a very small portion of our freight, yet we're closely monitoring that situation. On the domestic side, that's what Michael was commenting on earlier because fuel prices are lower than where they were at least this time last year. And based on our contracted rates, we should see some slight benefit throughout the year on the domestic side."", 'Irwin Bernard Boruchow', 'Got it. So slight benefits throughout the year on domestic. Adam, just based on the line of sight you have, is there any point in this year where ocean freight should flip to -- from a tailwind to a headwind? Or is it just kind of like flattening out for you guys?', 'Adam M. Orvos', ""We'll have to see how that conflict plays out is probably the biggest variable hike. We have a fairly good line of sight other than that variable that we can't control."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Simeon Avram Siegel', 'Nice job. Sorry, if I missed it, but did you talk about whether any of the transaction -- the traffic increases, are you seeing any trade down benefit? And then probably a dumb question, but does the sharply priced brands impact where you are at all, impact where you are or is it really -- is it just creating better value proposition without impacting AUR? And if it does, any order of magnitude we should keep in mind?', 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Simeon, on the trade down customer, we did -- I'll just repeat that for us, it's hard to see whether there's a trade down customer performance. Was broad-based, as we said, across geographies, but it was also broad-based across income levels. So hard to really tease out any impact to the trade down. On the transaction data, the comp was entirely driven by traffic or transactions for us. The average basket was flat as slightly higher average unit retails were offset by slightly lower units per transaction. And then on the weather front, it was neutral for us."", 'Simeon Avram Siegel', 'So the sharply priced brands impacting going forward? Should we think about that from an AUR context? Or is that just changing the concentration of brands?', 'Barbara Rentler', ""It's -- the AUR fluctuates. It's based on the mix and the value of the goods that we're buying. So there's not a specific AUR pricing strategy. It's really a value strategy as we buy goods and put them at the sharpest price as we can to offer great value. So it's not like we're trying to hit a specific AUR or -- it could move as we go through the year and as we go through different closeouts, products and all of that, we're expecting it to move around."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.', 'Paul Lawrence Lejuez', ""At dd's, I'm curious how many stores are in region where you considered disappointing and what percentage of the store base do they represent? I'm curious if they didn't open as strongly as you thought? Or are they not comping as quickly as you thought? And also curious how the Ross Stores are performing in those same regions?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Paul, I mean there are certain stores outside of our core markets, that's what I would say on number of stores. So you can see our store map. As far as Ross, Ross is performing fine in these markets. And it's really how they opened. Some of them are comping well, but they're comping off a low sales base."", 'Paul Lawrence Lejuez', ""Got it. And then you mentioned, I think, 10 to 15 store closings. How did that break down, dd's versus Ross?"", 'Adam M. Orvos', ""Store closings. So we talked about -- Paul, we talked about 10 to 15 either relocated or closing stores, and we won't get into Ross versus dd's on that front."", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Nor have we decided yet. Usually, these are stores, I think, Paul, as you know, these are at the end of the lease term or starting a new option period where we'll make that judgment as we progress through the year."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.', 'Marni Shapiro', ""Congrats on a really nice quarter. And I'm going to hop in on the pricing question. I'm really sorry. But I want to just clarify the sharp price pricing because it sounds like Barbara, you're thinking about this a little bit more holistically, sort of getting to a better balance of really sharp opening prices and then layering that next level and the next level, versus looking at what you purchased and maybe taking a shorter margin here and a longer margin there. Is that right? Am I hearing that right?"", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Whenever you're pricing goods, Marni, you're always doing what you're saying. You're looking at the product and you're looking at the value, right? So it doesn't necessarily always have to do with what you're paying for a product, right? The merchants are looking at it and saying this is the right value and they're doing it. I think the sharp pricing that we're talking about is really adding more brands at all 3 levels, good, better, best, assessing those brands and then putting them out at the values that the customers really responded to. So it's -- it's really built on the products themselves. I don't know how else to say that to you. We have the brands we want to have. We have [visits and] people who are growing. We've opened a lot of new resources this year. The merchants have been out really looking for new resources, looking to expand, looking to remix the products and labels themselves and then to put that mix out at sharp prices. So it's not like I'm looking to have x price point or x in each thing. It is really a value strategy, not a pricing strategy. It's a value strategy."", 'Marni Shapiro', ""And where does beauty -- because it sounds like you had a nice quarter in beauty that typically carries a lower AUR, but can drive a lot of traffic? Does beauty carry a good margin? And where does beauty fit into the strategy for '24?"", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Well, Beauty has so many components in there from a margin perspective. Overall, the beauty margins are fine or good. In every business we went in and looked at what our values were, what our brands were, what our product offerings were and we went in and said, some businesses we thought were on track and we're fine. In some businesses, we're learning we have more opportunity after what we've learned starting in Q2 all the way through Q3 and Q4 and building on that. So it's kind of an evolving process. But there's -- again, it's really a merchant-driven process and making sure that we put out the best possible value in the things that the customer wants and that we have the right brands, the right recognizable brands at each level; good, better and best."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.', 'Aneesha Sherman', ""I have two, please. I'm curious about -- can you talk about the cadence of comps through the quarter, particularly coming out of holiday into January and where you were exiting the quarter? And I have another one on stores. You talked about initiatives in the stores, and you've talked about it for the last couple of quarters. Do you see more structural benefits to store 4-wall margins over the next year or so from the store initiatives that you've been rolling out?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Aneesha, it's Michael. On both of those. So we typically don't talk about inter-quarter trends. I will say, on a stack basis, comps were the -- slightly stronger during the peak holiday period, holiday selling period. On the 4-wall margin, so the type of investments we're making in stores, we're making a number of investments to improve efficiencies in the stores. In many cases, that's just offsetting some of the minimum wage -- statutory minimum wage increases we've seen. Some of the things we're doing are technology investments for instance, we're piloting self-checkout in all stores. We don't ever think that that's going to be a full chain rollout, but we'll see how that goes. We've put in place more efficient handheld devices and it's used to check inventory, take markdowns, manage tasks and eventually even allow associate scheduling within the store, all drive efficiency that help us offset the rising minimum wages."", 'Aneesha Sherman', 'Sorry, just a quick follow-up, Michael. Can you give us a sense of how much of that has already been rolled out versus how much is to come over the next fiscal year?', 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Well, I mean there are things beyond that. This fiscal year, we have a number of rollouts. And as Adam said earlier, that's fully offsetting the minimum wage increase.

As you think about the store profile in 2024 for both dd's and Ross, any changes in how you're thinking about it in terms of size? And then Barbara, you've always talked in the past about adding to the merchant team. What does it look like this year in terms of number of buyers, merchants added to the team or how you're thinking about it?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Staying on the store profile, I'll give you the easy answer on that one. No, we're not thinking of any changes to the store prototype as we move into '24."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""And in terms of the size of the merchant team, we have over 900 merchants. So every year, we -- every year, we promote people, move people. But in terms of saying, am I going out to take up the head count substantially? I think it's just -- I think it's more of a normal cadence that we would have. We feel like we have a pretty large team between the two companies."", 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Just one follow-up. As you went through the quarter in January, we know there were those two weeks that were very cold. Was that an impact for you and the comps and the comps would have even been stronger if you hadn't had that weather issue that happened mid-January?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', 'Dana, on the quarter overall, so we take puts and takes all the way November through December, we think the weather impact was neutral for us.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.', 'Corey Tarlowe', ""Great. In the past, I know you've talked about 60% to 65% new store productivity. Given your comments on dd's, recognizing that it's a smaller portion of the fleet, is that a consistent assumption within your guidance for 2024?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""It continues to be because the vast majority of the new stores are Ross. That said, the stores that we are opening for dd's, we expect them to be similar to historical sales levels because they're in the existing markets. But overall, 60% to 65% of a comp."", 'Corey Tarlowe', 'Great. And then just a brief follow-up. Other than new stores, what areas are you investing in, in the CapEx? And how are you thinking about leveraging AI in your business?', 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""So first on where else we're investing, about 40% of the capital this year is just expanded capacity. So we're opening a -- plan to open a new DC in early '25 in Arizona, and we have another one, a DC that we're going to start construction on later this year on our next distribution center. So 40% of that capital this year is on increased DC capacity. AI, I would say there's two parts of AI. We already use AI in some of the automated parts of our business. I think generative AI will be a journey for us like it is for others, but it is something we'll be looking at to find efficiencies in the business."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen & Co.', 'John David Kernan', ""Great job on the holiday quarter. Just going back to stores. Ross Stores banner grew 4% this year. I think that was the fastest store growth since pre-COVID, dd's is up over 7%. How do we think about store growth not just for fiscal '24, but also beyond that and how that fits into your long-term store targets?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Sure. First of all, our long-term store target hasn't changed, and that's 2,900 Ross Stores and 700 for dd's. I think you'd expect about 100 stores a year, depending on how the dd's plays out beyond this. But I think we're comfortable with the 75 Ross stores annually. That's a good fit for us, and we'll see where the dd's roll out after we get through our strategy."", 'John David Kernan', ""You haven't seen any long-term change in terms of competition for real estate, your peers in off-price are growing a lot of stores, too. I think there's been concerns about some of the availability out there, but it doesn't sound like you have any concerns?"", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""Well, there is -- I would say there's a lot of -- there's a lot of competition for our locations. But I'd say overall, we feel good about the real estate landscape and have a healthy pipeline."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets.', 'Laura Allyson Champine', ""It's related to the way we're reading stores, which to us looks like you're making a conscious decision to sharply control inventories, to maximize profits and minimize markdowns. Are we reading that right? Or is this just a small sample size of stores?"", 'Adam M. Orvos', 'Laura, are you just talking about inventory levels at year-end? Is that your question?', 'Laura Allyson Champine', ""I'm talking about inventory levels that we're seeing currently over the past couple of months in stores really post holiday."", 'Michael J. Hartshorn', ""I would say post holiday for us is really a clearance period. So -- it is our lowest inventories of the year and it happens to be our lowest sales period. So we want to start off the year correctly. So it doesn't surprise me that it would feel that way if you're looking at the stores in January. I think as you progress through the spring, we manage our in-store inventories based on term, and we set it up. If we can beat the plan, then we can leverage markdowns. So that's the way we run the business, and we try to beat the turn from the previous year."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank.', 'Krisztina Katai', ""Congratulations on the strong quarter. So I wanted to ask in terms of the competitive backdrop, many of bigger general merchandise retailer are still look fairly lean on inventory, I think especially when we look at apparel and certain discretionary categories as we head into the spring. So I just -- I was just curious how that's sort of incorporated into your thinking on comps and maybe where you see some of the biggest opportunities in the first half to take share."", 'Barbara Rentler', ""Krisztina, I'm not 100% sure what exactly -- what you're getting at exactly. Could you just say that again?"", 'Krisztina Katai', ""Sure. It's just that many of your bigger general merchandise peers are still planning inventories very cautiously and they're sort of lean on inventories in many discretionary categories. So as you're sort of planning your business, you're looking at your good, better, best sort of assortment, maybe just how you're thinking about your position for spring and then heading into the summer?"", 'Barbara Rentler', ""So the first part in inventory, as Michael just said, we plan our inventory based off of sales and turn. And so -- and we build that by business, really bottom up, just in terms of pure inventory level and then we drive receipts. We have the inventory base we think we need and then we go to chase, and we drive the receipts, which drives the sales which drives the profits. That's from basic inventory. In terms of which categories, that's a merchant-driven strategy in terms of what businesses we're going to go after, where we see the opportunity in the outside world, where we know we can show great value and where we can add assortment. So there are kind of two different levels of thinking. And remember, it's a flexible business model. So if business really takes off and as we've started to beat our sales plans, we have the ability to take the inventory up or drive the inventory down because the model is flexible, the stores are flexible and the products are flexible. So we go -- we start in with our base plan and then again, build up for sales turn and then we go -- then we react to what the customer is telling us. So it's kind of fluid."", 'Operator', 'And our final question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""Barbara, you talked that one of your goals for the year was taking market share. Is your expectation that you're going to take market share from other off-price retailers or department stores or maybe just a little bit of everybody?"", 'Barbara Rentler', ""I just think -- look, I just think there's market share to be had. I mean, more stores keep closing. I mean -- and there's just less places for consumers to shop and our job is to satisfy the customer. And if we do that, there are consumers out there for us to pick up and to expand. So we want to be able to satisfy our current customers and get her to come back more. We want to be able to add additional customers because as we know, as there have been many store closures over the last few years, that's also helped to fuel off-price.

Both metrics improved year over year. The strong results can be attributed to customers' favorable response to quality, branded bargains, leading to significant earnings growth. The year witnessed a strategic increase in merchandise offerings and efficient operational adjustments, positioning Ross well for fiscal 2024 despite potential economic uncertainties.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have rallied 35.8% in the past year compared with the industry's growth of 29.6%."", 'Ross Stores, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ross Stores, Inc.

The sales improvement mainly stemmed from strong comparable store sales (comps) performance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, comps improved 7%, mostly attributed to higher customer traffic and a favorable reaction from shoppers toward the enhanced assortments across its stores. Our model had predicted comps growth of 1.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.The cost of goods sold (COGS) of $4,375.4 million increased 11.4% year over year and exceeded our estimate of $4,220.5 million. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 72.7%, marking a year-over-year expansion of 265 basis points (bps). Our model had estimated a 160 bps decline in the COGS rate to 73.7%.The increase in the COGS rate was mainly driven by a 110 bps rise in the merchandise gross margin on reduced ocean freight costs and a 75 bps decline in distribution costs, partly resulting from the favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy costs declined 75 bps and 45 bps, respectively, in the reported quarter. These positives were partially negated by a 40 bps increase in buying costs, largely due to higher incentives.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $903.1 million increased 23.8% year over year and were higher than our estimate of $853.1 million. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, expanded 100 bps year over year to 15%. We had estimated the SG&A rate to be 14.9% for the fiscal fourth quarter, indicating a 90 bps increase year over year. The increase in the SG&A rate was mainly because of higher incentive costs and store wages.The operating margin of 12.4% improved 170 bps year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 from 10.7% reported in the prior-year quarter. The growth was driven by improved same-store sales and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher incentives.

Packaway merchandise was 40% of total inventories, in line with the year-ago quarter.The company bought back 1.9 million shares for $247 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. In fiscal 2023, it bought back 8.2 million shares for $950 million. This marked the successful completion of its two-year $1.9 billion share repurchase authorization announced in March 2022.Additionally, the company approved a new two-year share repurchase plan to buy back shares worth $2.1 billion. Under the plan, it expects to repurchase shares worth $1.05 billion each in fiscal 2024 and 2025. The new repurchase program reflects an 11% increase from the previous buyback authorization of $1.9 billion.', 'Backed by the ongoing sales momentum, Ross Stores remains optimistic about the upcoming year. However, the company remains cautious owing to current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties as well as persistent inflation, which is affecting consumer spending on housing, food and gasoline. Consequently, ROST has provided a conservative view for fiscal 2024.For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, comps are expected to rise 2% to 3%, with total sales growth of 6% to 8%. The company expects EPS between $1.29 and $1.35, up from $1.09 reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. ROST anticipates an operating margin of 11.1-11.4%, reflecting lower incentives and freight costs, partially offset by lower merchandise margins and higher wages.For fiscal 2024, ROST expects comps growth of 2-3% over a 5% gain reported in fiscal 2023. The company estimates sales growth of 2-4%. The company projects EPS of $5.64-$5.89, up from $5.56 reported in fiscal 2023. Ross Stores notes that fiscal 2023 recorded a benefit from an additional week.Operating margins for fiscal 2024 are expected to be 11.2-11.5%, with expectations of pressures on merchandise margins due to plans to offer more sharply priced brands. Net interest income is expected to be $143 million. The company expects depreciation and amortization expenses of $610 million, including stock-based amortization.

The reasoning seems to involve lackluster Site Development revenues. Yet, this is a non-core division for SBA and likely serves another purpose. In the meantime, SBA’s core Site Leasing business continues to deliver solid metrics. Investors should likely focus on that, as SBA’s ability to create strong shareholder value remains robust. Hence, I am bullish on SBAC stock.', 'To reasonably assess SBA’s investment case, I believe that investors should focus on its core business. The seeming downturn in SBA’s Site Development throughout 2023, which has likely contributed notably to keeping shares under pressure, should be largely irrelevant to the stock’s investment case. Let’s take a look at the company’s recent numbers, which will illustrate my point.', 'For context, SBA’s revenue mix can be split into two parts: Site Leasing, which is the company’s main cash flow source, comprising 93% of its total revenues in Fiscal 2023, and Site Development, which made up the remaining 7% for the year.', 'All that matters for SBA is delivering robust performance in its core Site Leasing segment. This is because the recurring nature of the segment’s revenue and the underlying organic growth drivers set to push it higher over time are what ensure the REIT’s long-term success.', 'Site Leasing revenues once again grew by 3.7% and 7.7% in Q4 and FY2023, respectively. In addition to acquiring and constructing new towers, the division’s growth was driven by organic catalysts, including expanding the number of tenants and/or antennas per tenant on each telecom tower and SBA enforcing the annual rent escalation mechanism embedded into long-term leases.', 'The Site Leasing revenue bridge below, comparing the end of 2022 to the end of 2023, underscores these drivers and the overall mission-critical aspect of SBA’s core business model. As you can see, SBA maintained a tenant churn as low as 3.5% last year ($82 million in churn against $2.34 billion of revenues last year). This is because SBA’s telecom towers comprise essential infrastructure for the major telecom providers that lease them.', 'In fact, evident by the $97 million in new leases and amendments, which more than offset this figure, the churn itself can be largely attributed to antenna relocations by lessees to enhance efficiency. Therefore, the churn itself is by no means indicative of SBA’s tenants struggling to meet payment obligations, which we would otherwise assume if we were assessing a conventional (retail, commercial, industrial) REIT.', 'Besides its core Site Leasing business, which generates the majority of revenues and is non-cyclical in nature, SBA also has a Site Development business. However, it’s essential for investors to recognize two things here:', 'First, it’s crucial to note the cyclical nature of this business when evaluating SBA’s overall performance. Notably, the only reason SBA’s total revenues declined in Q4 was due to the 49.1% drop in Site Development revenues.', 'Second, it’s essential to understand that SBA partly maintains this business to maintain strong relationships with the telecom majors that lease its towers. It doesn’t seem like making actual money from this division is a concern for SBA.', 'Here’s what SBA outlined in its latest 10K filing:', 'Our site development business…is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations.', 'SBA Communications', 'Considering that two-thirds of SBA’s total revenue comes from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), it’s important for SBA to maintain solid relationships with these giants. Nevertheless, the Site Development division should be viewed more as a strategic component for market positioning rather than a substantial revenue stream. After all, this division doesn’t generate substantial profits.', 'Besides SBA’s revenue mix, it’s important to remember that its underlying profitability prospects remain very strong. Therefore, its capacity to continue to create shareholder value also remains very strong.', 'In particular, SBA’s adjusted funds from operations per share (AFFO/share, a cash-flow metric used by REITs) for Fiscal 2023 came in at a record $13.08, up 12.7% compared to the previous year. Further, management expects AFFO/share to be between $13.15 and $13.51, the midpoint of which implies another year of record profitability.', 'Given SBA’s highly resilient business model, continuous growth in its core leasing division, expanding profitability, and growing capital returns (its quarterly dividend was raised by 15.3% to a rate of $0.98 in February), combined with the fact that shares are currently hovering at their 2019 levels, form a compelling buying opportunity, in my view.', 'Looking at Wall Street’s view on SBA Communications, the stock has attracted a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $264, the\xa0average SBA Communications stock forecast implies 21.7% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell SBA stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Ric Prentiss from Raymond James, with an average return of 10.83% per rating and a 76% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'Overall, while recent setbacks in SBA’s non-core business may have spooked investors, I believe that a closer look at its revenue mix reveals a more comforting reality. SBA’s Site Leasing, which constitutes the majority of revenues, showcases consistent growth and stability. In the meantime, the Site Development division should be appreciated, as it’s of strategic importance for SBA and should not be assessed based on its underlying financials.', 'Simultaneously, SBA’s strong profitability last year, promising outlook, and rapidly growing dividend form a compelling opportunity against the stock’s pressured price.', 'Disclosure']"

On the flip side, even the largest tech stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tend to focus on growth at all costs while trading at higher multiples than typically seen in value stocks. Even tech stocks offering dividends, a hallmark of value investing, tend to devote less capital to the initiative than they do to growth and have expectedly low yields as a result. For example, Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) recently announced dividend represents a meager 0.41% yield, and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn’t much better at 0.53%.', 'But these value tech stocks buck the trend while straddling the fine lines between maturity, expansion, innovation and reliance on existing revenue drivers. Each is dominant in their respective fields but, not content to rest on their laurels. Each is also aggressively expanding while exploring new income opportunities.', 'Finding a legacy media stock like News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) on a list of value tech stocks seems counterintuitive. Legacy media sources, like newspapers, books and cable television, were once News Corp’s bread and butter. But today, Americans are increasingly moving toward next-gen media consumption. In a surprising move, NWSA is one of the few legacy media stocks effectively navigating the transition, unlike, say, Warner Bros Discovery’s (NASDAQ:WBD) ill-fated HBO Max transition.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be fair, some of the pressure forcing NWSA’s adaptation is the recent inclusion of activist investor firm Starboard Value snagging a “sizable” stake in the company. Since then, NWSA added 3% to quarterly revenue year-over-year and a whopping 94% to net income. CEO Robert Thomson attributes the improved top- and bottom-line stats to “our strategic shift to digital and subscription revenues, and away from sometimes volatile advertising revenues.” In effect, NWSA follows the lead that many software-based value tech stocks set when prioritizing recurring revenue (at a seemingly lower price point) over a one-time or intermittent larger payoff. In this case, NWSA is swapping digital subscriptions for high-spend ad accounts, just as value tech stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) charge users a few bucks monthly for Photoshop rather than hundreds upfront.', 'Thus far, the strategy is paying off as the company also focuses on more niche markets, including top-performing segments like Dow Jones and its range of digital real estate services. NWSA is reducing its emphasis on dividends, for now, as it right-sizes operations to adapt to changing trends, but the company still offers a modest 1.55% total yield.', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stands out among the top value tech stocks because, in many ways, it embodies the apparent contradiction between “value” and “tech.” The company, a member of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100, is one of the stablest and largest medical hardware manufacturers. But, whereas competitors tend to offer a steady but boring suite of medical hardware, ISRG brings robotics and automation to the operating room in an aggressively high-tech, high-growth business model.', 'ISRG is accelerating its global expansion as post-pandemic fatigue wears off within the wider healthcare ecosystem. The last quarterly report saw global da Vinci procedures (ISRG’s proprietary robotic surgery platform) grow 21% year-over-year (YoY), and new da Vinci installations grow 14%.

Over the past 52 weeks, TPR's PEG has been as high as 0.95 and as low as 0.54, with a median of 0.78."", ""We should also highlight that TPR has a P/B ratio of 4.08.

They will each appeal to different types of investors, but they all offer very attractive stories today. Here's a quick look at each."", ""A lot of dividend investors will look at NextEra Energy's 3.7% dividend yield, which is roughly average for a utility, and move right on to the next investment. That would be a mistake if you like dividend growth, since NextEra has increased its dividend at a roughly 10% clip over the past decade. And that payment has been increased annually for nearly 30 years. The key here, however, is that the utility sector downturn has pushed NextEra's yield up to near the highest in a decade, suggesting the stock is on sale."", ""What you get if you buy NextEra is a unique combination of a boring regulated utility business (about 70% of the company) and a fast-growing clean-energy company (30%). And while rising rates may take the growth rate down a notch, the company is still projecting 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2026. That's a rapid clip in the utility sector, and it should keep the dividend on a solid upward path. Long-term dividend growth investors have an opportunity to add a great company at a reasonable price today, and that shouldn't be ignored."", 'Enterprise Products Partners operates one of the largest portfolios of midstream energy infrastructure in North America. It charges fees for the use of its assets, so the price of the oil and natural gas that flows through its pipelines, storage, processing, and transportation facilities is less important than demand. On that score, energy demand is expected to remain robust for decades to come, even as clean energy production increases thanks to a growing global population and rising living standards.', ""That's the underpinning of the story. But what makes it really exciting is the ultra-high 7.3% distribution yield on offer here. The distribution has been increased for 25 consecutive years. It's backed by an investment grade-rated balance sheet. And distributable cash flow covered the payment by a very healthy 1.7 times in 2023. To be fair, the yield will probably make up the vast majority of an investor's return here, but if you're trying to maximize your income stream, that probably won't bother you at all."", 'Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker has been a tough company to love for a couple of years. A series of debt-funded acquisitions, supply chain disruptions, and volatility surrounding the coronavirus pandemic pushed earnings materially lower in 2022 and again in 2023. But management has done a lot of heavy lifting in an effort to get the company back on track, including debt reduction, asset sales, and the streamlining of the company. In 2024, earnings should hit an inflection point and grow over 2023 levels.', ""The industrial company isn't out of the woods just yet, but as investors see positive momentum, Wall Street will probably start to take a more positive view of the stock. Meanwhile, this Dividend King is offering investors a historically high 3.6% dividend yield. If you can stomach buying a turnaround play, Stanley Black & Decker looks to be about to turn the corner earnings wise. There might not be much more time to buy it before other investors start to catch on to the improving business performance."", 'Few investors will want to buy each of the stocks on this list, because they all appeal to different types of investors. Dividend growth types will appreciate NextEra Energy, yield seekers will like Enterprise, and more aggressive investors willing to step into a turnaround story will probably find the likely earnings upturn at Stanley Black & Decker very exciting', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

Year to date, both of these stocks are up over 80%, which is even better than Nvidia's gains thus far. "", ""Not all of Nvidia's investments achieved such sudden spikes in value. But with both SoundHound and Arm being key players in artificial intelligence (AI), investors may view Nvidia's investments in the two businesses as votes of confidence in their potential roles in the AI revolution."", 'While Arm was already fairly well known in the tech world, SoundHound was more of an unknown. And with a market cap of less than $2 billion, it might have more potential to rise higher in value. Could the stock be a better buy than Nvidia right now?', ""As with Nvidia, what might attract investors to SoundHound is that this is also an AI company experiencing some terrific growth. In its most recent quarterly results, which covered the last three months of 2023, SoundHound reported 80% revenue growth, with its top line hitting $17.1 million. And while it remains unprofitable, losses are shrinking -- SoundHound's net loss of $18 million was less than the $30.9 million loss it reported in the prior-year period."", ""By the end of 2025, SoundHound expects its top line to exceed $100 million, which is more than double the $45.9 million it reported for all of 2023. It also expects to be profitable on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). In 2023, SoundHound's adjusted EBITDA loss was $35.9 million."", ""With a key investor such as Nvidia behind the business, this may not be as risky a stock as it otherwise would be. And that's important, given the massive growth opportunities SoundHound can pursue."", 'The near-term opportunities for SoundHound are promising, but in the long run, there may be much more room for the business to get even bigger. The company provides voice AI solutions which, through its Dynamic Interaction interface, are used to take orders in drive-thrus. It also has opportunities within other industries, including automotive, where it can help take directions from drivers and respond to questions.', 'The company believes its total addressable market is worth more than $160 billion, and with significant barriers to entry, Soundhound has a big competitive advantage over potential rivals. Its AI platform is also available in 25 languages.', ""SoundHound's business is still in its early growth stages, and it has a lot to prove. Nvidia has invested in the business, but investors shouldn't assume it will provide a safety net."", ""But given the company's strong growth prospects, the many potential applications for its voice platform, and the many restaurants using it, including White Castle and Krispy Kreme, there are a lot of reasons to remain bullish on the company's long-term prospects."", ""If you are willing to take on some risk and invest in this modestly sized stock, SoundHound could be one of the better AI investments to load up on right now. It does have the potential to outperform Nvidia, but SoundHound will need to deliver strong results to do so, and while it is growing, the danger is that investors may end up expecting too much too quickly from this stock. And that's why it may still not be a slam dunk to outperform Nvidia this year, even with its strong head start. Volatile stocks like this can quickly give back gains if investors become pessimistic."", 'However, as long as you are patient and willing to temper your expectations for the AI stock, SoundHound could be a good buy for the long haul.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. For example, the McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) share price is up a whopping 347% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 15% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.', ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' Check out our latest analysis for McKesson ', ""While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During the last half decade, McKesson became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.', 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""It is of course excellent to see how McKesson has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at McKesson's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, McKesson's TSR for the last 5 years was 366%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's good to see that McKesson has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 56% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 36% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McKesson better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with McKesson , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", 'But note: McKesson may not be the best stock to buy.

During the forecasted period, two-thirds of the market is estimated to stay relatively stable with L0 or L1 vehicles requiring traditional insurance. L0 vehicles have no automation whereas L1 vehicles have some degree of driver assistance. However, the remaining third will face substantial changes mainly because of the rapid adoption of EVs and road safety technologies.', 'EVs and the latest road safety technologies are poised to decrease accidents, reducing premiums by up to 10%. Almost $26 billion reduction in premiums is expected during the forecasted period. The rising popularity of shared mobility will also lower the distance traveled, further impacting premiums. The changing industry landscape is predicted to surge the demand for new personal lines insurance products. Personal lines coverage refers to insurance policies that provide coverage for individuals and their assets.', 'Almost 25% of premiums will still require personal-lines coverage even after the adoption of the latest technologies. However, innovation in the different distribution, product, pricing, and claims approaches would be necessary to keep up with the customer demand. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) could play a significant role by influencing access to customers and requiring OEM-certified repairs. Another expected shift with be in liability to commercial-lines products as autonomous L3 vehicles become more common.

However, today most consumers have to choose between efficiency and sustainability when choosing a form of energy to use. What if I told you there is a way for our energy to be both efficient and sustainable? Hydrogen energy is the answer. Not only that it’s morally attractive and better for the planet, but it also has strong potential for growth. A 9.2% CAGR is predicted for the hydrogen industry until 2030, with the potential for faster growth in the following years. The biggest current challenge is adapting hydrogen energy for consumer use instead of simply industrial use.

Although the company had released a concerning Q3 report last November, Plug Power has successfully rebounded after its new green hydrogen plant operation in Georgia, which is the biggest liquid green hydrogen plant in the country. This new plant would allow Plug Power to reduce expenses, contributing to improving financials. The company has announced that its Q4 earnings will be released on the first day of next month before the market opens.', 'Furthermore, Plug Power has completed a massive 1.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy in order to launch six additional U.S. green hydrogen production plants.

CEO Jennifer Rumsey is moving the engine-maker and power distribution company forward after paying a record civil fine for emissions cheating that she said brought some over-the-top federal criticism.', 'Cummins in December settled a 4 ½-year-old case by paying a civil fine of $1.675 billion to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 1 million engines in Ram pickup trucks — Cummins’ biggest-selling engine program — contained data-defeating emissions software. The company in January agreed to pay California $175 million in the same case.', 'Together, the fines amounted to the second largest for Clean Air Act violations in history. Cummins’ fine trailed a $2.8 billion criminal penalty assessed of Volkswagen AG over the “Dieselgate” scandal.', '“I am disappointed, frankly, at the number and some of the tone given how we did try to work through this,” Rumsey said Tuesday in an interview at company headquarters. “But we’re moving forward. We haven’t slowed down on our strategy.”', '', 'In a Dec. 22 news release, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland effectively said Cummins put its customers’ health at risk.', '“Defeat devices on some Cummins engines have caused them to produce thousands of tons of excess emissions of nitrogen oxides. The cascading effect of those pollutants can, over long-term exposure, lead to breathing issues like asthma and respiratory infections,” he said.', 'In many cases, such comments get attributed to lower-ranking Justice Department officials.', 'Rumsey’s strategy is balancing its legacy business as the world’s largest maker of diesel engines with funding advanced powertrain systems that can run on a range of alternative fuels and standing up an internal unit called Accelera focused on zero-emission technologies.', '', 'A 25-year Cummins veteran, Rumsey was named the company’s first female CEO in July 2022. She is just the seventh CEO in the company’s 105-year history. Rumsey became board chair in August.', '“I think about the first two years as CEO, and I came into the role really clear with a focus on purpose, people and impact. That really was the centering driver for my career.”', 'The past 20 months have been busy. From ingesting the $3.7 billion acquisition of Meritor Inc. announced in February 2022, five months before she took over from her predecessor — and mentor — Tom Linebarger to rebranding the former New Power division into Accelera in March 2023 and recently completing the spinoff of a successful but ill-fitting filtration business, Rumsey didn’t exactly ease into the job.', 'Cummins is investing $1 billion in manufacturing upgrades and branding as HELMS its next-generation X15 engine platform. The same fuel-agnostic strategy applies to a new X10 engine family that replaces nine- and 12-cylinder engines.\xa0', '“HELMS stands for High Efficiency, Low Emission Multi fuel. These are going to be really innovative products that meet our customers’ diesel needs today with higher efficiency and let them move to these alternate fuels,” Rumsey said.', 'HELMS starts with a natural gas version that boasts fewer emissions. A diesel version compliant with 2027 EPA standards for smog-forming nitrogen-oxide emissions follows. A hydrogen fuel iteration comes in 2028. The fuel-agnostic approach also applies to the X10 family.', '“We’re seeing a lot of interest in the natural gas engine. [But] it’s not going to be a broad replacement for diesel,” she said.', '“Cummins is the natural gas leader in North America today,” she said.', '', 'It has made natural gas engines on its own since buying out joint venture partner Westport Fuel Systems for $20 million in February 2022. A 10-year partnership ended in December 2021. In that time, Cummins sold about 70,000 units. Already, the X15N has sold about 40,000 units in China, where it debuted in 2020.', '“That market grew faster than we anticipated in part because of the differential between diesel and natural gas,” Rumsey said.', 'The X15N was always planned for North America, where major fleet operators like UPS and Walmart are among companies that have tested it. Launch partner Paccar Inc. delivered the first X15N engine in a Class 8 Kenworth T680 in February. Cummins could build 3,000 of the engines this year in Jamestown, New York, earmarked for $452 million of the $1 billion in new engine investment.', 'Cummins is also building the natural gas ecosystem. It purchased 50% equity in Momentum Fuel Technologies from Rush Enterprises in January 2022 to make Cummins-branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for commercial vehicles.', 'It also is working with Chevron and Trillium, the natural gas subsidiary of Love’s Travel Stops, to boost production of renewable natural gas (RNG) made from dairy waste and other nonpetroleum sources. RNG’s emission profile can reach negative net-zero carbon.', 'The abundance of natural gas, both compressed and RNG, gives it a price advantage over diesel, offsetting in about 18 months the high cost of a natural gas-powered system.', 'While China proved a successful launch site for the X15N, Cummins’ 50-plus years of engine-building joint ventures there has had to hold on for the ride as the country careened from pandemic to recovery to lockdown to a real estate bubble that has weakened the once-thriving economy. Along the way, China implemented tougher engine emission standards.', '“We did an incredible job of continuing to operate even with the lockdowns to meet the demand that was there,” Rumsey said. “The China market is the hardest one for us to predict. So far, we’ve called the market gradually improving with replacement cycles and natural gas driving some demand.”', 'Russia is another matter. Cummins suspended operations, took a $158 million charge against earnings and broke off its joint venture in March 2022, the early days of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. There may be no going back.', '“We’re out of business in Russia today,” Rumsey said. “And unfortunately I don’t see any signs of that conflict resolving anytime soon.”', 'To hear the full Rumsey interview, tune into Truck Tech on Wednesday, March 13, at 3 p.m. EDT on the FreightWaves YouTube channel.', 'Cummins names Jennifer Rumsey to succeed Tom Linebarger as CEO', 'Cummins replaces 2 legacy engines with new X10', 'New Power division rebranded as future tech-focused Accelera', 'The post Cummins CEO moves company forward after record civil emissions fine appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

While Netflix has found out a way to make its business work, others are still struggling. One way for them to potentially overcome those obstacles is by joining forces."", 'A recent deal that could transform the streaming wars is a huge joint venture involving Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and ESPN, which Walt Disney owns. The companies plan to launch a sports-focused streaming platform which could be available later this year.', ""While this could help improve those companies' growth prospects, it could also undermine the potential for another streaming business: fuboTV (NYSE: FUBO). Shares of fuboTV have been under immense pressure as the stock has collapsed 94% in just three years."", 'Does news of this joint venture seal the deal for the struggling streaming stock? Is fuboTV stock headed for disaster?', 'There are two clear problems that the joint venture presents to fuboTV. The first is that since it includes three top names in the industry, customers could have access to a much broader and more comprehensive streaming option than fuboTV currently offers.', ""The second challenge is that it could drastically undercut fuboTV. While there hasn't been a formal announcement, there are rumors and speculation that the price could be $50 or less per month. In comparison, fuboTV's cheapest plan costs $79.99 per month. And a big downside for hardcore sports fans is that many streams are limited to 720p, which isn't optimal for people with 4k-enabled TVs."", 'The prospects of the joint venture aren\'t sitting well with fuboTV\'s management. The company has filed an antitrust lawsuit in hopes that it could stop the companies from coming together. CEO David Gandler wants a level playing field. ""We assert that this JV is an attempt to monopolize the sports streaming industry and eliminate competition,"" he said.', 'Whether the lawsuit is successful could ultimately determine the fate of fuboTV and whether it will be a viable streaming option in the future.', ""Even if fuboTV is able to block the joint venture, that still may not solve its core problems. Consider that for the last three months of 2023, the company generated $410 million in revenue, up 28% year over year, and yet fuboTV still incurred an operating loss of $72.1 million. At an already high price point, the company still isn't able to turn a profit."", 'Although its losses have shrunk over time, the business still has a long way to go to reach breakeven. Over the past 12 months, it has also used up over $177 million to fund its day-to-day operating activities as cash burn remains a big problem for the business.', 'The lackluster fundamentals at fuboTV suggest that joining forces may be the best option for streaming companies, particularly those focused on sports, to pursue. Rather than trying to block a deal, the company may be better off finding a way to be part of the joint venture.', ""If the joint venture goes through and the price does come in lower than fuboTV's offerings, there would be little reason to remain optimistic about the company's future. Without a superior offering and a higher price point, it may only get more difficult for fuboTV to grow its subscriber base while also having any hopes of breaking even."", 'The stock is looking at big troubles, and unless the joint venture falls through or fuboTV finds a way to become a part of it, investors are better off avoiding this beaten-down streaming stock. Things may only get worse for fuboTV from here on out.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in fuboTV right now?', 'Before you buy stock in fuboTV, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and fuboTV wasn’t one of them.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Oracle had US$88.8b in debt in November 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$8.69b in cash leading to net debt of about US$80.1b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Oracle had liabilities of US$24.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$105.5b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.69b as well as receivables valued at US$6.80b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$114.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because Oracle is worth a massive US$313.5b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Oracle's debt is 3.9 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 4.7 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. We saw Oracle grow its EBIT by 2.3% in the last twelve months. Whilst that hardly knocks our socks off it is a positive when it comes to debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Oracle can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Oracle recorded free cash flow worth 57% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""Based on what we've seen Oracle is not finding it easy, given its net debt to EBITDA, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. There's no doubt that it has an adequate capacity to convert EBIT to free cash flow. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Oracle's use of debt. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Oracle  you should be aware of."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing.

So when we looked at Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 32%. However it looks like Tractor Supply might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""To conclude, we've found that Tractor Supply is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 196% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's  ROE."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:', '15% = US$4.7b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, Occidental Petroleum's ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 21%, we aren't very excited. That being the case, the significant five-year 32% net income growth reported by Occidental Petroleum comes as a pleasant surprise. Therefore, there could be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""As a next step, we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 36% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is OXY worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether OXY is currently mispriced by the market."", 'Occidental Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 2.6%, meaning that it has the remaining 97% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.', ""Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio."", ""On the whole, we feel that Occidental Petroleum's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Occidental is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.5%.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $6.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.9%.

The EPS surprise was 0%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Occidental is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

That said, following Buffett's lead by acquiring Capital One stock could be a smart move. Despite rising about 25% over the past 12 months, the stock still looks like a bargain for investors willing to hold it over the long run."", ""Capital One turned a lot of heads recently with a $35 billion all-stock offer for Discovery Financial Services (NYSE: DFS). It's unclear if Berkshire Hathaway knew in advance that Capital One would try to acquire the smallest of the four main payment networks. That said, folks who keep an eye on the banking sector knew that Discover had been struggling and could be receptive to a buyout offer."", ""At the end of 2023, Capital One Financial was America's third-largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, based on outstanding balances. Every time a consumer pulls out their Capital One card to pay for something, Visa or MasterCard receives an interchange fee from retailers that Capital One would rather hang on to. By acquiring an established payment network, it can keep those fees or adjust them to compete."", ""By transitioning a lot of cards from Visa's and Mastercard's networks to its own, Capital One thinks it can generate $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies by 2027. That's a lot of extra income for a bank that earned $4.6 billion in 2023."", ""Capital One expects its proposed merger with Discover to close in late 2024 or early 2025, but that's a long way from guaranteed. You may remember that in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that directed federal regulators to strengthen oversight of bank mergers."", ""The company's proposed acquisition of Discovery Financial for $35 billion would be the largest merger between credit card businesses since before the Great Recession. And given the potential merger's high profile, it's no wonder that Senators on both sides of the aisle are already calling on federal regulators to block the deal."", ""Congressional pushback for a $35 billion banking merger is to be expected, but at the end of the day, regulators have to apply laws as they exist. Industry experts generally agree that putting Capital One's muscle behind the smallest of the four payment networks is a great way to boost competition against American Express, Mastercard, and Visa."", ""I won't be surprised if the Department of Justice attempts to block the proposed merger. That being said, I'll be shocked if any courts uphold an attempt to block the deal on grounds that it's anti-competitive."", ""Capital One expects to generate $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies from an acquisition of Discovery in 2027.

Looking back the second half of 2023 was largely defined by a heightened focus on execution and operating efficiencies. We took meaningful steps to streamline our cost structure and improve member engagement. It's aimed at accelerating our path to profitability and positioning us for sustainable future growth. From an expense standpoint, the largest item in our P&L is our leases. The team has done a tremendous job aligning our portfolio with our member base and the new post-pandemic normal of leisure travel. This included a detailed property-level analysis of our portfolio with an emphasis on unit economics, regional scale and member satisfaction. We were also successful in reducing our cash operating expenses. For the full year, we stripped out more than $20 million of expenses, a year over year reduction of approximately 15%. As you'll hear in a moment, we expect to continue to realize incremental savings in 2024 based on the actions we took in 2023 and most importantly, feel we have the right people in the right processes to handle future growth when the time comes. Next, I want to discuss the steps we've taken to improve our member experience. Although we pride ourselves in our member satisfaction as documented and highlighted by our best-in-class NPS scores of approximately 70, we've recently placed more emphasis on increasing member engagement and reenergizing our member base during periods of rapid growth. In the past, we would monitor positive trends in total nights booked and total nights delivered with less focus on who was booking and where they were going. So to address this midway through 2023, we took three decisive actions. First, we reorganized around a member success team dedicated to serving members and helping them book travel. Next, we lowered the asking prices for our nightly rates. And most recently we launched a loyalty program. Each of these were aimed not only in increasing our nights per member, but our paid nights per member at our managed and controlled properties. These notes are the most accretive in our portfolio. This approach has led to a series of small wins and a few recent trends that we have. Our eyes first in broader Rewards has been a hit since its launch in August, nearly half. Our members have gain rewards status based on their 2023 spend. As a reminder, our lowest status tier starts at $20,000 of annual spend. This is proof of our loyal and engaged member base. Second, we're raising the bar to entry and exit from in-store auto by focusing on selling multiyear memberships and renewals. This aligns with our desire to make any broader more of a club and less of a product. It has resulted in fewer but better sales and should continue to improve our member retention engagement. For reference, in 2023 over 90% of our new club sales were for at least one year and more than 75% were for two years or more. Finally, we saw an uptick in the number of reservations and nights booked per member to end 2023 and to begin 2024. However, and this is a small dataset in February. Those trends have normalize reverting to or even slightly below 2023 levels. Our team has a sharp eye on this very recent information, and we analyze both our engagement strategy as well as our travel trends at large. Look for updates on this throughout the year as it pertains to our expected results in 2024. This has caused a slightly wider range of potential outcomes. Although we are once again prioritizing our path to profitability, I'm confident that the progress we have made as an organization over the last six to nine months has led to a significant improvement in our ability to recognize, analyze and react in real time, and I'm exec I'm excited about our 2024 plans ahead of us for the full year, we remain focused on reaching breakeven of adjusted EBITDA and are expecting between a loss of $15 million and income of %5 million. Meanwhile, we expect total revenue between $275 million and $305 million, a decrease compared to 2023 due primarily to headwinds related to continued decreases in our pass subscriptions. I'll let Robert cover some of the details of the plan in a few moments, but would first like to highlight our 24 2024 strategic initiatives that position us to be a true turnaround story after rightsizing our cost structure and improving our operating efficiencies in 2023, we are shifting our focus in 2024 to our product offerings and customer acquisition strategy? Are we offering the right products? Are they complementary to each other? Are they priced appropriately? And are we targeting the right traveler? Inspiron has a deeply rooted brand that resonates with a large core audience. Over the last few years, we've grown our member base and our portfolio substantially. We've launched several new products with varying degrees of success. Our goal in 2024 is to simplify its product for both current members and prospective members as well. We want to return to our roots and operate as a true travel club well Re, instilling a sense of community amongst our members and importantly, continuing to deliver exceptional vacations. This broader path is a great example of an area we can refine over the past year, we've seen meaningful churn for many reasons, including life changes, the macro-environment and perhaps the past focused on the quantity of new member sales as opposed to ensuring the proper fit other prospective members. At the same time in 2023, while approximately 20% of our members were passholders, nearly 40% of our nights delivered were past nights the math simply won't work and as a result, pass has not been profitable. Ultimately, it's apparent that we need to improve passive positioning. What does it designed to do? What are the targeted towards and how does it coexist with club? Just last month, we announced changes to our product path today. It will function as the luxury travel offering for the frequent and flexible traveler. That means great value for an amazing number of trip options, Equitable rates to that of our club members for smaller number of premium trips and unparalleled access and value for last-minute bookings. We've embraced passes functionality by improving flexibility and access to short term booking. Since implementing these changes in mid-February, we've booked approximately 300 flip chips and 1,200 nights at properties that may have otherwise spoiled. Importantly, 60% of these reservations were for stayed within 30 days at the time of booking. We've also removed non-core features. The past that were costly, dense, Brado entering and infrequently used by members. And finally, we're planning to manage the number of past memberships in conjunction with overall inventory and market placement. These changes will simplify pass, improve the engagement and experience for our members and ultimately make pass more profitable for its products. Next, the team will take a fresh look at our other offerings to make sure they align with our strategic priorities while also providing tremendous value to our current and future members like any good brand that delivers value to its consumers and creates value for its shareholders and for auto success will be driven by our ability to drive member engagement and advocacy in order to do what we do best deliver exceptional service and value we need to do so from a position of operational strength with a solid foundation. At the end of the day, our mission is to inspire lasting memories and relationships by enriching the way our members experience the world. I'm fully confident that by staying true to our core values, care, collaboration, courage and curiosity, we will achieve just that in 2024. Before turning the call over to Robert, I'd like to thank our employees for their incredible work in 2023 with continued focus on execution. I believe we are set up for a much improved 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Robert."", 'Robert Kaiden', ""Thanks, Eric. Before giving more color on our 2024 plan, I'd like to quickly cover our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. In the fourth quarter, we generated total revenue of $71 million, a gross margin of $13 million, and a gross margin of $19 million, excluding the impact of asset impairments. Although fourth quarter revenue decreased 18% year over year, it's important to note that it was in line with our internal expectations over year-over-year decrease in revenue is due to decrease in both subscription and travel revenue. From a subscription revenue standpoint, we've seen a decline in both the number of pass and club subscriptions. However, due to the higher price point of a pass subscription past has been the primary driver of the decrease in subscription revenue. At year end, we had 13,800 active subscriptions, consisting of approximately 2,500 pass and 11,300 club subscriptions. This compares to 16,100 active subscriptions consisting of 3,600 pass and 12,500 club subscriptions at year end 2022. Keep in mind, we've invested significant sales resources in our Inscriber for good and in Sprout for business platforms, which combined generated approximately $25 million of contracted sales in 2023. Further is rider for goods sold more than 3,000 travel memberships last year that are not included in our subscription count. While there is no recurring revenue from the sales, we feel they are strong prequalified prospects that we're excited to introduce to these better experience and hope to convert to a full membership over time. As far as travel revenue, the year-over-year decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of total leads delivered specifically our paid night delivered in large part due to a decline in the number of clubs, subscriptions as well as the timing of our experiences and the deferral of some revenue due to the accounting treatment for rewards programs. In the fourth quarter, we delivered approximately 41,000 total nights with a resident occupancy of 65% compared to 47,000 total nights with 73% residents occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adrs were approximately $1,700 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to approximately 1900 in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the year-over-year decrease due to us lowering our ADRs midway through 2023. Meanwhile, when comparing full year performance. Resident's ADRs were relatively flat year over year at approximately $1,800 and we delivered a similar number of total nights in each of 2022 and 2023. At the same time, our resins occupancy decreased in 2023 to 72% from 81% in 2022, primarily due to increased availability. As a reminder, increased availability was due to new leases committed to in 2022 or before that were added in 2023 while our portfolio optimization efforts in 2023 will start to have a more significant impact moving forward. In 2024, we believe the combination of lower nightly rates and fewer nights available will help us find the proper supply and demand balance to improve our operating efficiencies. For the full year, we generated $329 million of revenue, which is around the midpoint of our guidance range of $320 million to $340 million. The year-over-year decrease in total revenue of approximately $15 million or 5% was due to decreases in each of subscription and travel revenue. The majority of the subscription revenue decrease was due to fewer pass subscriptions, while traveling revenue was mostly impacted by a reduced number of paid nights delivered in our residences, a positive both fewer clubs, subscriptions and more Hotel Travel. Moving down the P&L, our fourth quarter gross margin was $13 million or 18% of revenue compared to $25 million or 29% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Absent the impact of asset impairments, fourth quarter 2023 gross margin would have been $19 million or 27% of revenue. For the full year, our gross margin was $54 million or 17% of revenue compared to $116 million or 34% of revenue in 2022. Absent the impact of asset impairments of approximately $41 million for the full year, our gross margin would have been $95 million or 29% of revenue. Of note, these impairments were associated with leases predominantly in one geographic location. Cutting one level deeper, our fourth quarter cost of revenue was approximately $51 million, a 15% decrease compared to cost of revenue in Q4 of 2022. This is consistent with our efforts to better manage our booking fees, and it also includes a small amount of lease expense savings. As I'll touch on in a minute, we expect to continue this positive trend in 2024. Total cash operating expenses were approximately $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to approximately $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. While the fourth quarter of 2023 did include a favorable entry year period adjustment of $1.8 million related to operations. I'm proud of the progress we've made, and I'm confident that we can reach a sustainable run rate for 2024. For the full year, our cash operating expenses totaled approximately $131 million compared to $153 million in 2022. As a reminder, our guidance range for 2023 of $125 million to $130 million did not include our third quarter reduction in force executive management changes and associated severance payments. Finally, as Eric mentioned, I'm proud to report that our adjusted EBITDA loss of $29 million for 2023 ended the year slightly favorable compared to our previous guided range of a loss between $30 million and $45 million. This compares to a 2022 adjusted EBITDA loss of $32 million with quarter adjusted EBITDA losses in 2023 and 2022 of $5.4 million and $9.5 million, respectively. Equally important, we ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $42 million, which was slightly ahead of our internal expectation and represents a slowdown in our quarterly cash burn compared to the rest of 2023. Overall, I'm incredibly proud of how the team performed the past year. Specifically these past six months where I feel our results such as improved adjusted EBITDA are beginning to reflect the changes and efforts we've made. Turning to 2024, I expect continued improvement for the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA approaching breakeven more specifically between a loss of $15 million and income of $5 million and total revenue between $275 million and $305 million. Our number one financial priority in 2024 is reaching breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis. While total revenue is obviously important, it is merely an output of what we believe is a very achievable plan grounded on reasonable assumptions, as I'll cover in a minute, we expect a decrease in past subscription revenue, lower ADRs in our residents and fewer total members to be the main drivers of our decreased revenue. From a member standpoint, we're assuming club subscriptions to be relatively flat year over year, while pass subscriptions are expected to decrease by a similar absolute number in 2024 as they did in 2023. As Eric mentioned, we are confident that recent changes to pass will improve the member experience and overall functionality of passed. However, we also expect most of our sales focus to be on club, as is the true foundation of in Toronto and increasing our club membership ultimately enables increased pass memberships in the future. For club itself, we plan to continue targeting longer term stickier sales. We expect this to result in an increase in our club member base, which will be offset by the natural attrition of our legacy members. The net result in 2024 is once again expected to be a declining member base with a decrease in pass alone expected to create a subscription revenue headwind of nearly $30 million. From a travel standpoint, fewer members accrete to fewer total nights delivered. However, we're expecting improvements in terms of total occupancy and the mix between paid nighs and passed nights as well as resins nights and hotel nights. As Eric mentioned, we have seen mixed results from a booking perspective despite lower pricing for our rewards and member success team. As a result, our current range assume similar pay travel behavior for members 2023 plus or minus 5%. For residences, we're currently assuming rates slightly below $1,750 per night on average for the year, which compares to slightly above $1,800 per night received in 2023. On the hotel side, we expect a decrease in our total miles delivered in 2024 compared to 2023, though much of this is expected to be attributable to fewer past nights. Overall, we currently expect travel revenue to account for approximately 65% of total revenue, whereas in 2023 account for less than 60%. In terms of our cost structure, I've spent much of the past few quarters outlining our portfolio optimization plans, and I'm excited to begin realizing the benefits. In 2024, we expect approximately $30 million of lease expense savings compared to 2023. Coupled with our emphasis on reducing our booking fees, we expect to realize meaningful gross margin expansion beginning in the first quarter. Finally, I alluded to our fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses serving as a good run rate moving forward. Our full year range of cash operating expenses in 2024 is between $115 million and $125 million, which represents an improvement of 5% to 12% compared to 2023. All in, we expect to drive a meaningful year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA, driven by focus on improved efficiencies. We expect cost efficiencies in our leases, fixed and variable costs, booking expenses and operating expenses, and we expect operating efficiencies in our travel mix and more focused sales efforts. Overall, I'm pleased with the plan we put together time and again, on this call, we've referenced hitting our guidance range, and our intention is to continue building a track record of execution in 2024. Though we don't provide quarterly guidance, we believe this plan will deliver periods of positive adjusted EBITDA and ultimately improve our financial strength for the long term. With that, let me turn it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Mike Grondahl, Northland Securities.', 'Mike Grondahl', ""Hey, guys. Thanks. It sounds like you retooled the past membership quite a bit. And if I heard you right, it fell from like 3,600 to 2,500, and it sounds like it's going to fall by a like amount in 2024 to about 1,400 units for subscriptions. What does the new path look like? And do you think you've gotten that to breakeven or making a profit for you if you could answer that, it would be great."", 'Eric Grosse', ""Terrific. Thanks, Mike, for your question. This is Eric. On what I can do is talk a little bit about what path looks like and the changes we've made to it. And then I can pass it over to Robert to walk through the implications of what that means from a 2024 perspective. In terms of what path looks like and the changes are really what we wanted to do is to provide a big benefit to our pass holders and to enable a last-minute travel much more. So with past going forward with the concept, we're calling conflicts trips, which really opens up significantly more high-value inventory that likely would otherwise have gold go unsold. And as we noted since we've made this change, about 60% of the flex trips that we've sold are under 30 days of departure, which is a really good sign for us because it shows that we can really drive demand towards that on close-in piece that that otherwise might spoil. And what we're also doing in addition to providing this of this benefit, the significant benefit to passholders. I'm is also to streamline the product and to make it simpler on. So that's why we sunsetted capabilities within past that we're pretty unpopular with passholders. And we're frankly, pretty inefficient and expensive for us to operate. Likes of an example of this would be beyond travel as well as on past cruisers. And so a net, what we've got is, I think, a much simpler service and a much simpler to communicate product that has really, really strong value proposition to the right kind of passholder. The one that is spontaneous, the one that is flexible, the one that is open for last minute travel and also provides a very, very valuable niche in our overall product portfolio. So that it's a profitable product and can really contribute to Inspirato success as a whole."", 'Robert Kaiden', ""Great. Mike, I'll -- this is Robert, I'll take it a little bit further on the financial side of the house there. Past was just to be very clear, unprofitable for us in 2023. And before that, as Eric said before, 40% of our nights with only 20% of our members is going towards path. And moreover, lot of pass members, we're booking a lot of third party hotels, which which had a lot of booking costs associated with them as well. So a combination of between we're taking out some of those non-profitable areas, non-core, non-profitable areas of path of getting our members who are Pass members to get them a great opportunity for inventory that's really last minute would otherwise flow. It's a win-win. They're able to get inventory that's at a great price, great inventory at a great price and we're able to use some of that inventory. Those are some of the benefits and that we see and so passes in a much better financial position in 2024 and forward."", 'Mike Grondahl', ""Got it. And then a second question just on the gross margin impairments related to the leases, I think you said it was $6 million in 4Q and about $40 million in '23, would you say that's cleaned up now? Do we have to worry about those 1Q 2Q?"", 'Robert Kaiden', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. Absolutely. We feel like we're in a good place now. We've known about these impairments for some time now. And the reason they've been rolling in quarter over quarter is because under again these this group of arrangements we have for a certain number of properties. We've been rolling them in over time. And so every time we've rolled them in from an accounting perspective, is the first time we could take an impairment charge on them. So those are all now rolled into our portfolio. Those are all at fair value like any company. It could be a small one-off impairment here or there, but we're not expecting any sort of large impairments on a go-forward basis."", 'Mike Grondahl', ""Got it. And then maybe lastly, on any update on Capital One, I think it I think that partnership sounds like it starts in the second half and they kind of have to roll it out. How would you bake that into 24? And what can that look like over '25 maybe?"", 'Eric Grosse', ""Sure. Thanks, Mike uplift where I think we've been very clear that we're tremendously excited about our capital one partnership come mainly because our respective strengths are so well suited for one another. I mean, what we're very good at is finding and managing a pretty world class portfolio of high-end residences and giving our members a pretty first class experience when they when they travel with us. And Capital One amongst other things, is a pretty world-class demand aggregator, and they're really focused on becoming a very major player in travel. So that dynamic, I think, creates a win-win situation for both of us, which is why Capital One was so excited about our partnership and why they invested in the last last fall. And so what we're doing right now is working very hard on all the tenant, technical integration work between ourselves and Capital One and their technology partner hopper. And we really expect to be operational in the first phase of our partnership in the second half of this year. In terms of forecast, it's always difficult to predict what a large new partnership will bring on and it's still in the near term. Yes, I'd say we've been always probably a little bit more cautious in how that up, how that partnership will perform but and grow out of the blocks. But when you take a look at Capital One's size, commitment to travel and breadth and then you look at it relative to our size, I think it's pretty clear definitely over the medium to longer term going to be a game changer for us."", 'Mike Grondahl', 'And it looks like they may get Discover too, which would maybe even make a bigger.', 'Eric Grosse', 'Good point.', 'Mike Grondahl', ""Do you think it's June or July before you have a better feel is it September, like when do you think you'll get, I don't know, a better sense of what it looks like roughly when during the year?"", 'Eric Grosse', ""Well, I would say that that I mean Q3 is when we're launching it. So we'll have sort of initial data points then going into the fourth quarter, which typically tends to be a stronger seasonal period for us, we should have a better idea. And so I think it's fair to say that our confidence will increase over the course of the year."", 'Operator', 'Shweta Khajuria, Evercore ISI.', ""Hey, this is Luke on for Shweta. On just two questions, if I could. Can you just go over any low hanging fruit on the operating expense side, where you can drive efficiencies? And then how should we think about the seasonality of your revenue and EBITDA throughout '24. Can you just help us kind of think about how to model that?"", 'Eric Grosse', ""Sure. With respect to expense efficiency, this is one where I want to give credit to the team on what we've done. And over the course of the last six to nine months, we have done a lot of work to basically streamline our business and make us more operationally efficient so that we can be successful and get to profitability on a wider range of outcomes. And so that really starts with our portfolio. Our real estate portfolio on Robert's led a tremendous effort to rightsize that part of our business and also as a result of shifting demand really towards our risk properties would be able to we're able to make meaningful improvements on our COGS line as well. And when you combine that with the OpEx improvements we've made just in terms of becoming more operationally efficient, both in terms of personnel as well as process, you're looking at a year-over-year swing in excess of $50 million and so that is really important to us being able to say that we have a shot and we have line of sight to get to break to breakeven. And maybe I'll hand it over to Robert to handle to answer your question around seasonality."", 'Robert Kaiden', ""Yes. And maybe a little things, just to contextualize this a bit more on some of the things that Eric talked about when it comes to our overall costs. And we think about 2024, like we've been talking about in these last few calls, there are things that we've done already, and that's much of the savings that we'll have in 2024 are things that are done and dusted. So for instance, we've talked a lot about our portfolio optimization which will have savings year-over-year savings of approximately $30 million. Those are agreements that we terminated in 2023, where there was just a period of time that needed to pass before we were fully out of those leases. A lot of those were six months and some of them were 12 months. So we're starting to see in -- really in Q1 the impact of the ones that were rolling off in six months coming off the books and then will be a brand that will be our biggest quarterly decline in terms of the number of leases -- $1 of leases, and then we'll see an additional gradual decline throughout the rest of the year. When it comes to the operating expenses, we've taken a lot of actions already. So as you know, we had a reduction in force a first in January last year and then in July of last year and we'll get the full year benefit of that, a second reduction in force when we move into 2024. Moreover, as we were going through our planning cycle back in the fall, there was a lot of other things we looked at in operating expenses, how could we be more efficient in our software spend lots and lots of little areas that in total are piled up and amounted to the savings that we're talking about. And you'll see this is part of it like a three-year trend. We went from 100 -- approximately $155 million in 2022 to approximately $135 million in 2023. And now we're coming down to $115 million to $125 million.So I think we've we've kind of optimized on what we can do from a operating expense savings perspective. As it relates to your question on seasonality on revenue and EBITDA. We've had somewhat fairly consistent seasonality over time, and it really starts with the revenue because most of our costs are fairly straight line across the year. And so as our revenue goes for a particular quarter, so goes our EBITDA as well. Bob, when I look at our revenue, you break it down into two pieces, the subscription revenue and then there's travel revenue as it relates to subscription revenue, that is generally fairly straight line as well. Although as we talked about before, we'll see a decline in our past number of subscriptions as we go through the year. So there will be a decline over time in subscription revenue because of that fairly straight line across the year. When it comes to travel, we have are periods where we have folks traveling more and we have periods where people actually book travel more. And so typically, Q1, Q3 and Q4 are heavier travel periods relative to Q2, Q2 is and you just don't see as much in that April to June timeframe, but it's also time where there's more bookings generally to prepare for either the summer season or even to prepare to start getting ready for it at a year in travel again. So we expect that revenues will follow for travel, something along those path between Q1, one three and four. There's a little bit of seasonality even within those. But overall, we'd say that's when we'll see the higher revenue because it's when people take the trips that we recognize the revenue."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to CEO, Eric Grosse, for closing remarks."", 'Eric Grosse', ""It's a terrific. Well, thanks, everyone, for listening and participating in our quarter call. Look, we're committed to keeping our lines of communication open and look forward to our next earning call for the first quarter, which will be in May. In the meantime, thanks very much and talk soon."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.""]"

Trikafta sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $2.29 billion and $2.28 billion, respectively.The upside was driven by the continued robust performance of Trikafta in the United States, fueled by label expansions to younger age groups (two to five years old).

Thank you for joining us today as we share our third quarter and year-to-date results for fiscal 2024. Before we get into the specifics of Brown-Forman's performance, I wanted to take a moment to offer a few comments about the dynamics and trends within the broader spirits industry. The last few years have been some of the most volatile and complex in my 26 years in the spirits industry with a variety of factors creating noise within the system. This can make it hard at times to distinguish between short-term headwinds and long-term trends.The last few months have been particularly noisy as demand for spirits has been normalizing after more than 2 years of outstanding growth. To truly understand the current environment, however, it's important to reflect back on the beginning of the pandemic when the closure of the on-premise limitations on travel and remote work prompted many consumers to shift their spirits consumption from bars and restaurants and invested at home bars for entertaining. Once restrictions eased and bars, pubs and restaurants reopened, consumers began spending heavily on vacations and other experiences they missed during the lockdowns. In addition, many consumers continue to entertain at home. Many in our industry call this the COVID supercycle. In calendar 2023, after 2-plus years of above average spending, consumers were getting back to more normal consumption patterns but were soon faced with high inflation and increased interest rates that made them reconsider when and how they purchase spirits. By the late summer of 2023, the Spirits industry across much of the developed world, including the U.S., saw the impact of these changing consumer behaviors in the form of weakening takeaway trends. However, we continue to believe, as we mentioned last quarter that these trends are a direct result of the volatility consumers experienced since the pandemic and do not imply a longer-term change in the way they consume and enjoy Spirits. At the same time, consumers were adjusting their behavior as a result of the pandemic. Brown-Forman had its own set of pandemic-related challenges to navigate. This included disruptions to supply chain logistics and glass supply constraints that impacted our historical distributor ordering patterns and created unusual comparisons over the past few years. Today, we have a supply chain that is adjusting back to normal levels of consumer demand, and at the same time, it's also facing increased inflation, increased interest rates and increased competition. I share all of this to try and bring clarity to the difficult dynamics we've had to navigate and to explain why despite a challenging fiscal year, we continue to remain confident in the long-term health of the spirits consumer and the spirits industry.The other very important topic for Brown-Forman this fiscal year is the improvement in our gross margin. This too has been a journey we've been on now for several years. We've continued to execute our pricing strategy through our enhanced revenue growth management capabilities and increased price. We've benefited from the growth of our super premium brands in the form of more favorable price mix and these improvements, along with the absence of the supply chain disruption costs in the year ago period more than offset higher input costs, and we're pleased with our strong gross margin expansion. Now let me provide a bit of perspective on our fiscal 2024 net sales. Our reported net sales growth increased 1% in the 9 months of fiscal 2024 with flat organic net sales growth. These results compare against strong results in the prior year where strong consumer demand, higher pricing and the rebuilding of distributor inventories generated high single-digit reported net sales growth and double-digit organic net sales growth. I encourage you to reference Schedule D, which illustrates 5 percentage points of impact to our organic net sales from an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories. If you factor in this impact, our top line results continue to be in the range of our longer-term trends and help support our belief that our business is solid and our brands remain healthy.In the 9 months of fiscal 2024, the largest growth contributors to organic net sales growth were in Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, New Mix and Glenglassaugh. As you will recall, the international rollout of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple had been slowed by the pandemic-related impacts. However, as supply and logistics challenges were eased we were better able to meet consumer demand, which drove growth for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, particularly in markets such as Brazil and Chile. We've also had a strong launch in South Korea, resulting in very strong double-digit growth for the brand. Despite a challenging environment in Mexico, New mix continued to deliver double-digit organic net sales growth as the brand benefits from higher pricing and continues to gain value share in the RTD category. Glenglassaugh continues to be a standout brand as its awareness and prestige among whiskey connoisseurs continues to grow. As we discussed last quarter, the brand continued to benefit from CASK sales through its old and rare program. In addition, Glenglassaugh Sandend was named the 2023 Whiskey of the Year by Whiskey Advocate Magazine. This is our second year in a row that a Brown-Forman brand has received powerful and impactful acclaim from whiskey critics across the globe. If you'll recall, Jack Daniel's Bonded captured this most coveted global accolade in the whiskey industry back in 2022. Since I mentioned Jack Daniel's Bonded, I'll also note that collectively, the Jack Daniel's super-premium expressions delivered strong double-digit organic net sales growth in the year-to-date period. This growth was led by Jack Daniel Sinatra, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye Barrel Proof and the newest member of the bonded series Jack Daniel's Bonded Rye. This is the result of our purposeful efforts to premiumize the Jack Daniel's family of brands and elevate our whiskey credentials through innovation and special launches. In doing so, we give both long-term friends of Jack Daniel's and new friends, the opportunity to explore and discover within the Jack Daniel's family.Also included in this innovation is the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD, which just celebrated 1 year since the national launch in Mexico. While it's still early to the brand's global launch, the Jack & Coke RTD has earned numerous awards, including best canned cocktail and best drink concept by Beverage Digest and named the Coca-Cola Company's #1 innovation in 2023. Jack & Coke is the #1 RTD SKU in Great Britain and Poland and remains the #1 whiskey-based RTD in the United States. And in less than 12 months, over 100 million cans have been sold in just 13 markets, increasing brand visibility not only for the RTD, but also for Jack Daniel's full-strength portfolio. The Jack Daniel's RTD portfolio had minimal impact on the overall organic net sales results in the year-to-date period, largely due to the transition of the Jack and Cola business to Jack & Coke. We believe this transition is building a stronger, more premium and more global foundation that creates value and supports our long-term growth. The benefits from the premiumization trend continue to be evident in the organic net sales growth of Woodford Reserve, which returned to growth in the year-to-date period, driven by the brand's luxury expressions such as Batch Proof and the Masters Collection. Our founding brand, Old Forester, introduced the newest expression in its super premium Whiskey Row series Old Forester 1924, a 10-year-old whiskey with a suggested selling price of $115. The Whiskey Row series continues to grow but also creates a halo for the parent brand, and I'm proud to say that Old Forester has recently crossed the 0.5 million 9-liter case milestone. And our newest super and ultra premium brands, Gin Mare and Diplomatico entered our organic results in the third quarter and collectively delivered a very strong double-digit organic net sales growth. To wrap up our top line performance, I'll share a few thoughts on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which was the largest offset to growth of our organic net sales. First of all, it is lapping an exceptionally high comp from the prior year period. Also, volume declined in the 9 months of the fiscal year, mainly related to our route-to-consumer transition in Japan, the U.S. and the comparison against the inventory rebuild in Sub-Saharan Africa in the year ago period. We believe these disruptions are circumstantial and temporary and are confident that Jack Daniel's remains in a position of strength with robust medium- and long-term performance and exceptional brand health. For example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has again been named the most valuable spirits brand in the world by Interbrand, making this the eighth year in a row. In fact, based on our consumer insights research, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey ranks #1 or #2 across the measures of brand awareness, penetration and consideration across most markets. And we continue to support the brand's health and growth through the Make It Count global campaign, the Jack & Coke RTD and the McLaren Formula 1 sponsorship. We have strategies and plans in place to return Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey to growth which we will share in more detail during our Investor Day later this month. While the path to normalization in the spirits category impacted our top line results, we continue to be pleased with our gross margin. As I shared previously, we have moved from contraction to expansion in the first 9 months of fiscal 2024, our reported and organic gross profit increased 5% and 6%, respectively, both were ahead of the respective top line growth rates. The strength and health of our brands, along with our continued brand building investments enabled us to increase price across many brands in our portfolio, which helped drive the 290 basis points of price/mix contribution to gross margin.Gross margin also benefited from the absence of supply chain mitigation costs, which more than offset higher input costs. As a reminder, in the prior year-to-date period, we incurred increased transportation and logistics costs in order to satisfy the demand from our distributors and retailers for the important holiday season. In total, favorable price mix the absence of supply chain mitigation costs and lower tariff-related costs due to the removal of the U.K. tariffs on American whiskey more than offset higher input costs and the negative effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. This resulted in 250 basis points of reported gross margin expansion in the year-to-date period. In summary, we continue to operate in a very dynamic operating environment that has impacted our short-term results. We believe that we will benefit from the evolution of our brand portfolio, long-term pricing and revenue growth management strategies as well as a moderating cost environment even as consumer demand normalizes. The spirits category offers attractive growth, healthy margins and high returns on capital, and we're well positioned globally with the premium and super premium brands in growing categories. We also have an organization of highly talented people who are committed to our strategic priorities and company values. I'd like to thank all of our Brown-Forman employees across the world for their focus on growing our brands and achieving our long-term ambitions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leanne and she'll provide additional details on our geographic performance, other financial highlights as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. From a geographic perspective, our emerging international markets collectively delivered 11% organic net sales growth and continue to lead the company's growth in the year-to-date period. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, particularly in Brazil and Chile, once again led the growth due to our ability to meet strong consumer demand with the return of normal levels of supply. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey growth was led by Türkiye as momentum in the premium whiskey category continued. In Mexico, New Mix continued to deliver strong double-digit growth as the brand continued to benefit from our pricing strategy and gained share of the RTD category.In the travel retail channel, organic net sales grew 1% in the 9 months of the fiscal year, which is impressive as it lapped 52% growth in the year ago period when international airline travel and the cruise industry rebounded and nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. Strong double-digit growth of our super premium American whiskeys such as Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel's American Single Malt, our exclusive global travel retail offering and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel was partially offset by declines in Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. Turning to the United States. Organic net sales decreased 2% driven by lower volumes, partially reflecting an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories of 2%. The impact of our year-to-date results due to the comparison against the significant inventory rebuilding during the first half of fiscal 2023 moderated as we believe distributor inventories normalized in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and have remained at normal levels. Our pricing strategy, which led to higher prices across much of our portfolio, led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and el Jimador helped to limit the decline. Consumer demand for U.S. whiskey, particularly super premium remains strong as U.S. whiskey is the second largest contributor to total distilled spirits value growth in Nielsen. The demand for our super premium Jack Daniel's products, Jack Daniel Sinatra, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye Barrel Proof and Jack Daniel's Bonded Rye along with our limited releases of Jack Daniel's 10- and 12-year old delivered strong growth and partially offset the decline in Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey volume. The fastest-growing category in the U.S. remains the ready-to-drink category. It has been nearly 1 year since the launch of the Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola RTD in the United States, and the brand continues to grow and gain share. Jack Daniel's RTD, led by Jack & Coke remains a top 10 brand family by value in Nielsen. We continue to believe that our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from the consumer trends of premiumization and convenience. Moving on to our developed international markets. Collectively, organic net sales declined 6% for the 9 months of fiscal 2024, driven by lower volumes, primarily reflecting an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories of 6%. The growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, led by the continuing successful launch in South Korea and Glenglassaugh's old and rare cask sales in Singapore was more than offset by declines Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Japan related to the estimated net decrease in distributor inventory due to the fulfillment of backlog orders in the second half of last year when supply was available to meet this demand coupled with the transition activities to our own distribution. We continue to progress as planned with our launch just a few weeks away on April 1. In addition, as we continue to drive and build our business in Europe, we are pleased to announce that we will establish our own distribution organization in Italy effective May 1, 2025. Italy is one of the top 5 spirits markets in the European Union, making it an important market for driving the growth of our Jack Daniel's family of brands globally and in particular, for our latest portfolio additions. Italy is the largest market for Gin Mare and the fifth largest market for Diplomatico rum globally. This market holds significant potential for future growth, and we believe this change will enable us to strengthen our commercial and brand-building capabilities while increasing consumer focus and prioritization of our portfolio.As Lawson has shared the details of our strong gross margin expansion for the 9 months of fiscal 2024, I will now turn to our operating expenses and income. As we have shared with you in prior quarters, we allocated more brand-building investment in the early months of fiscal 2024 to support the launch of the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD in the United States. We also increased investment for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey due to the phasing of our investments, our operating expenses continued to moderate through the 9 months of fiscal 2024, which resulted in organic advertising expense growth of 7% in the year-to-date period. Similarly, organic SG&A investment also moderated through the 9 months of fiscal 2024 as we continue to invest behind our people. Primarily led by higher compensation and benefit expenses, resulting in an increase of 8% for the year-to-date period. Our year-to-date reported operating expenses, which decreased 11% were impacted by 3 items. The absence of the prior year noncash impairment charge for the Finlandia brand name, the current year gain on the sale of Finlandia and the absence of the prior year post closing costs and expenses related to the acquisition of Diplomatico and Gin Mare. In total, reported operating income increased 25% and organic operating income grew 2% in the 9 months of fiscal 2024. These results led to a 32% diluted earnings per share increase to $1.58 per share. Before moving to our outlook, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide you with an update on our share repurchase program that we announced on October 2, 2023. As you may recall, the Brown-Forman Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of our outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. I am pleased to announce that as of December 31, 2023, we have completed the program.Now turning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As Lawson highlighted, global trends are normalizing after 2 years of very strong organic net sales growth in what has been a challenging and dynamic operating environment we experienced softer-than-expected consumer trends during the important holiday selling season globally, which limited our expected top line acceleration. While we have to lap stronger shipments associated with the launch of Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the year ago period is in line with longer-term historic trends. We also expect to continue to benefit from our long-term pricing and revenue growth management strategies as well as the contribution from our recent super premium brand acquisitions, Gin Mare and Diplomatico. We now expect our organic net sales growth to be flat for fiscal 2024. Also in this fiscal year, we continue to believe our gross margin will expand as higher input costs driven by inflation will be more than offset by price mix and the absence of supply chain disruption. Our outlook for organic operating expenses to increase remains the same and assumes incremental advertising spend will be above our top line growth rate. Our expectation is that SG&A growth will remain higher than historical averages as we continue to expect higher compensation and benefit-related expenses and costs related to our transition to own distribution in Japan. Based on these expectations, we anticipate organic operating income growth to be in the range of 0% to 2% for the full fiscal year. We have revised our expectation for the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 to now be in the range of approximately 20% to 22%, and we now anticipate capital expenditures to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million for the full year. Before opening the call up to Q&A, I would also like to add a few comments on our recent capital allocation actions, in particular, the sale of our cooperage in Alabama, the pending divestiture of Sonoma-Cutrer and our long-standing commitment to our community and the environment. During the third quarter, we announced the sale of our cooperage in Trinity, Alabama to Independent Stave Company. In our continuing efforts to optimize our wood supply chain, we have committed to a long-term strategic relationship with Independent Stave Company to ensure a stable supply of high-quality barrels to meet our demand at a competitive price while creating efficiencies and optimizing capital allocation in our supply chain. The relationship also allows for the expansion and diversification of our supply chain network. Brown-Forman will continue to own and fully leverage the Brown-Forman Cooperage in Louisville, Kentucky. This allows us to produce approximately half of the barrels required to support our needs while enabling us to continue developing and innovating for our brands and new expressions.Moving to Sonoma-Cutrer the divestiture to o The Duckhorn Portfolio and the assumption of an equity ownership position in the company subject to certain customary closing adjustments and conditions is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. We continue to believe in the strength of the Sonoma-Cutrer brand and its future growth opportunities and that this transaction reflects our portfolio evolution strategy as well as our commitment to long-term value creation. And lastly, I would like to share that we have recently announced that in fiscal 2024, we have committed to a $22.5 million investment benefiting the Brown-Forman Foundation and Dendrifund. Brown-Forman Foundation was created in fiscal 2018 with the goal of helping fund our ongoing philanthropic endeavors with a focus on our corporate hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. The Dendrifund, a nonprofit seed fund created by Brown-Forman and the Brown family in 2012 helps to promote a more sustainable whiskey industry with a focus on the 3 natural resources most important for the distillation and aging of whiskeys: wood, water and grain. As you know, at Brown-Forman, we take an integrated approach to value creation, where all aspects of our company contribute to and are fundamental to our strategy, including our commitment to environmental sustainability, alcohol and marketing responsibility, diversity and inclusion and contributing to the vitality of the communities in which we live and work. These investments are just 2 examples of how we are living our spirit of commitment. In summary, we are adjusting to more normalized levels of consumer demand and a challenging and dynamic operating environment. As we look to the end of fiscal 2024, we believe that we have moved beyond the most difficult comparisons and disruptions of our fiscal year and will benefit from our long-term strategies as well as our portfolio evolution. We believe our portfolio of brands is strong as they are participating in growing categories and price segments and are driven by the consumer trends of premiumization and the desire for convenience and flavor. While we have more modest near-term expectations, we believe our long-term perspective will enable us to navigate the current environment and its short-term impacts as we have many times since our founding in 1870 and to deliver consistent and reliable performance and returns over the long term. We look forward to seeing many of you in-person soon and sharing more about the confidence we have in our long-term ambitions at our Investor Day on March 20. This concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""Great. So I'm still, honestly, to all the prepared remarks, a bit confused around where the shortfall really stemmed from both in the quarter and stemming going into Q4? Because you talked about sequential improvement in the second half with what was expected. Third quarter looks like it decelerated sequentially despite the easier comp. I know you mentioned softer holiday demand globally, but again, that doesn't really help me with the 4Q. So just if you could maybe rank order what sort of where the areas were of short-term negative surprise, I think that would be really helpful."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Thanks, Lauren. And I'll go ahead and I'll step back a little bit broader first, and then I'll narrow and specifically to your question. So first, let me say, we think about our business in decades and generations, and I'd like to point you to Slide 5, which when we think about the 2020 decade that we're in and the kind of the first 3 full fiscal years, you can see that our compounded annual growth rate for that period of time on an organic net sales basis is at 9%, which is definitely above our long-term growth algorithm. And then kind of moving closer into the period that we're in now, we have now lapped the first half of F '23, which was our strongest first half growth rate in the last decade. We talked about that in our last call and that was all about rebuilding our inventories.And then if you kind of look at last year, kind of 9 months year-to-date and this year, that CAGR is 6%, which is in line with our longer-term growth algorithm. So when we step back and look at it at the broadest perspective, so far for this decade, we believe we're off to a good start, and we have confidence that our business is sound with a strong gross margin expansion and strong cash flow. So just to set the stage and then I'll dial in even closer to your question is, you're right in this what we said is during the important holiday selling season, we did not expect the softness of consumer trends that we did see during that important holiday selling season, and that has now limited our top line acceleration.When we think about it from a market perspective, for us, it was U.S. and the key developed markets of the U.K. and France. And I'm sure in this call, we'll talk a lot about the U.S. But while we're here, I'll talk about the U.K., which we know the U.K. part of it is about our transition to of the Jack Daniel's and Cola to the Jack Daniel's on Coca-Cola business, but we really did see a slowing consumer and a very strong promotional environment during the holiday selling season. And then in France, we saw the slowing consumer trend, even kind of declining more than what we expected with the softness in the whiskey category and definitely some trading down in that market. And then what I would say then kind of the rest of that piece is the slowdown across many of our emerging international markets, which was just more than what we had expected in our guidance. One thing I can say is you can see in Schedule D -- or sorry, Schedule B that when we reported last time, our shipments and depletions for our full strength portfolio were in line. We now see where we are year-to-date that our depletions are ahead of shipments. So again, that's another signal that we believe that we are kind of moving beyond what we have had to lap. But then as we talk about kind of to your point with the last quarter, like we shared in our last call, when we think about the second half, we know we have to lap, the launch of Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD in the U.S. But when you look at kind of the -- the half as a whole, we have to comp of plus 5%. And where we believe we're going to be able to do that is, again, with the contribution of our newly acquired brands of Gin Mare and Diplomatico. We're continuing to see benefits from pricing and revenue growth management, which is kind of equating to that strong gross margin expansion that you have seen in our results. And then again, our operating expenses increase. That remains the same, where we had phasing where our brand expense was greater in the first part of the year, we now -- that will moderate through the rest of this year. And SG&A expenses, that's related to the higher compensation and benefits-related expenses as well as our increased expenses for the own distribution investment that we're making in Japan that's set to go live on April 1. So that is all built into our guidance."", 'Lawson E. Whiting', 'Let me give you a shorter version, Lauren. Christmas stunk around the world for the -- I mean we had a lot of markets that disappointed during Christmas this year, which we did not expect when we were thinking about our year-to-go period 3 months ago. So it was surprisingly weak.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""Okay. Then just one quick follow-up because that was a very full-some answer. Both versions. The short and long. But what does that mean for inventory levels in Q4? Because I know, Leanne, you called out the shifts versus depletes in that like the big picture laps are getting to a better -- we're moving along. But shipments -- like shipments were also weak for Christmas, right? I'm just trying to put the two pieces together because if you expected Christmas do better, usually the shipments have kind of happened, right? And it's the depletions of the problem. So that's also a little bit surprising to me if I'm making sense. I would expect it to be shipments might have been okay, but depletions would have been the problem and that would be the hangover for Q4."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. I think what we saw was we didn't see those orders come in for the important holiday selling season like we -- at the level that we traditionally do and being able to comp above where we were. So that didn't come in the way that we expected again in that late November, December time frame that we were expecting. And so when we think about it, again, we continue to be in a bit of a different position, which we've talked about this many times as we rebuilt our inventory. We continue to believe that our inventories through the supplier to the distributor, to the retailers, consumer are in line.And really, this is about consumer takeaway at this point for us. And so again, we're -- that fluctuation in consumer takeaway being lower than what we expect to really drove that for us. We do continue to see when we'll go to the U.S. specifically, you continue to see that net change in distributor inventory kind of come back in line if you look from the first half to the third to the 9 months ended, that is coming much more back in line, which we said we expected it to moderate."", 'Operator', 'One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.', 'Bonnie Lee Herzog', 'I actually just maybe have a bit of a follow-on on the conversation you guys were just having. Regarding inventory levels, but more at the consumer I guess, level. Do you have a sense of where these are and really how much you think consumer pantry destocking is impacting the category? And then your thoughts on when that might reverse? And Lawson, do you still believe the category growth will get back to the mid-single-digit range? And then if so, how quickly could this occur?', 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""Yes. Okay, Bonnie, it's a good question because we have -- we have talked a lot about that internally over the last few weeks around -- I'm talking about the consumer inventory thing. And I do think, and I believe, although it is -- that's a hard number to get to. There's really no way to study consumer inventories necessarily what's still in the pantry. But my theory, if you look at the last 3, 4, 5 years, you can see the elevated growth rates. Leanne was just quoting a few of them. But let's just focus on the 3-year because it's on that Page 5 of our -- you're looking at a 9% organic growth rate over 3 years, including this year. That is way -- several points above any sort of normal run rate for the most part in our industry. Some of that has to be sitting in a consumer's pantry at home.Now people think of Spirits is often referred to as a fast-moving consumer good and it's really not. It's not like food or some other categories that move much faster. Spirits, I call it kind of in the middle when I think about different consumer categories, I think about food being the fastest, I think, about -- an exercise bike is the slowest because once you pull that demand forward, you're not going to go buy another bike. Spirits is in the middle. And so it is taking some time to clear those consumer cabinets.We've said before that we look at like 80% of our consumer base only buys 2 bottles a year. So they have a bottle sitting in their cabinet at home that's probably half full, and it's just the deferred cost. The good thing is we think that if you do the math around that, that should largely be over. And that's why Leanne just said here, we expect going forward particularly in the U.S., I think we're talking, but our sales rates to be much closer to what consumer takeaway is right now.That's question one. What's the other? It was -- oh yeah -- when do we get -- yes. TDS getting back to norm of 4% to 5%, which is what it has been for like decades, short of the last couple of years and all the volatility. I know I've seen some of our competitors that have said anywhere from 6 to 18 months, and that's a pretty big -- that's a pretty big range. I think for us is what we're saying, we do believe next year will start to return to those normal levels as this inventory conversation largely, we think, will largely be over."", 'Operator', 'One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan, you may proceed.', 'Drew Nolan Levine', ""This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. So just following up on the U.S. You talked about some changes in consumer behavior internationally in France. I think you're seeing some trade down. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the U.S. any items of perhaps more value-seeking challenges or trade down? And then also what you're seeing from an on-premise perspective, if there's been any incremental softness there?"", 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""Yes. So look, I mean, on the trade down -- this is the U.S. And I think this is good news, I think, relative to probably what people are expecting. But if you look at the data, particularly I'm looking at Nielsen data, over the last 3 months, you're not seeing trade down. And we've still got the same dynamic where I'll simplify a little bit here, but $30 and above is growing much -- and take RTDs aside to pull that out of that when I say this, but 30 and above is growing at a materially better number than 30 and below. And so that's just -- we're not seeing the trade down in our own portfolio, and we're not really seeing it across the industry yet. So I think that just hasn't happened. And that -- I think we were expecting to see maybe a little bit more of that. So I generally consider that good news. And on the pricing environment, which you didn't specifically ask about that, but I think it's worth talking about that for a second because pricing really has not -- we've been worried as you've seen, consumer weakness, but somehow that would result in more aggressive pricing, deeper pricing to Christmas, all those kind of things. And it didn't really happen. And we're not really seeing that coming through the data right now. If you look at TDS across spirits, it's still positive, like plus 1 or 1.5, something right in there. And interestingly, this is where we were narrowing down even quicker is tequila in the U.S. and then U.S. whiskey across the U.S. and both are also positive. So there's been a lot of speculation that tequila pricing would start to fall apart as the costs have come down. It's just not showing. And if you look at the last 13 weeks, and you go -- which would cover the Christmas time period, both those categories saw improved pricing, not lower. And so while I do hear a lot of these anecdotal stories of XYZ brand went deep or whatever it might have been, and there are examples out there like that. But for the most part, pricing is holding up so far, and I consider that to be a pretty big positive too."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', 'On premise?', 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""On-premise. Do you have -- don't have the on-premise number in front of me. Sorry, we don't -- I don't have the on-premise numbers right in front of me. So I don't -- I haven't seen a material change in those necessarily. But trying to find the data point. Let's get back to you on the on-premise one."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""This is where we talked about that there's 2 points of acceleration compared to the October 23. So we continue to see acceleration there with TDS and Brown-Forman now growing low single digits."", 'Operator', 'One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Chris Pitcher with Redburn Atlantic.', 'Chris Pitcher', ""Just a question in terms of buying patterns. You sort of alluded to it. But in the current environment, have you seen any structural changes in how retailers or wholesalers are buying in given the sort of the interest rate environment and the uncertainty. Is that creating making it harder for you guys to plan? And then if I can have a follow-up, just on Japan, you flagged that as being one of the areas that got hit hard by destocking. With sales down 100%, it's quite hard to gauge what the real underlying revenue is with your new route to market there. Could you give us an idea of what sort of scale the Japanese business is still running at despite all these massive distortions?"", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. So I'll go back to the first part of your question, which is as far as buying patterns, we shared with you, I think, in our last call that as how we prioritize rebuilding the markets that we have with -- and replenishing their distributor and retailer inventory. That kind of has changed in the short term, our traditional consistent seasonality of the shipments that we -- pattern buying that we have seen. We're still lapping some of that, especially as you get into our emerging international markets, and we're lapping the way that we rebuilt that and the timing and the cadence is a little bit different. It makes -- it does make it a little bit harder. But I think for us, the biggest piece again was back to that important holiday selling season and consumers being stretching their discretionary spend because of how they've been impacted with interest rates and inflation. And for Japan, when we look at that business, again, this has been a year of kind of two pieces. One was how we've rebuilt our inventory in the prior year. And I think we said in our prepared remarks, we had a backlog of orders waiting for supply to be able to fill those we were able to do that in the second half of last year. So coupling that with our route-to-consumer change, it has just basically -- we haven't needed to make any shipments to Japan this year. To your point, what's the business look like more on a depletion base. And we would say we have been in frequent connection with the team there as they continue to progress to this own distribution model on April 1.And from a depletion base, we are still excited about the health of our brands in that market. So again, I would say from an organic perspective, we just have -- we're investing in the long-term value creation opportunity in Japan, and it's set to be a growth driver as we're moving forward."", 'Chris Pitcher', ""Just quick -- normally, a company -- a country, a market would drop out if it's not in the top 10 in a period. Can we assume the fact that you've still put Japan in there that it would be a top 10 market for you on a normalized basis?"", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. How we set our top 10, and I think we have it in our Q, it's basically set on April 30 of our prior year. So it's in there for that reason."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein.', 'Nadine Sarwat', ""Two for me. First, just a clarifying question. You had mentioned your view that perhaps the market in the U.S. could get back to that historical 4% to 5% value growth in the next year. Could I just clarify with that fiscal next year or calendar next year? And then my second question is something I think a lot of people are bringing up amongst investors, the topic of moderation, perhaps younger consumers drinking less adding some GLP-1s in there. I mean all of this has been thrown around as potential reason for the weakness that we're seeing in U.S. spirits. But to be honest, in U.S. alcohol more broadly with the implication that, that could be a permanent change. I would be curious to get your views on that, those -- all those factors I listed and where do you think it goes from here?"", 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""Yes. Good. So Nadine, a few things on this because it's obviously a topic that we have spent a lot of time trying to understand a little bit better, too. If over the last -- I'll make it up, 5 years, we had seen TDS go from 5% to 4% to 3% to 2% to 1%, something like that. I would be concerned with some of those things you just talked about, wellness trends, cannabis trends, GLP-1s, all those types of things, that would be an indicator that something is happening structurally in the business that's going to -- that could be permanent. But that's not what we saw. We -- as I think everyone on this call knows, I mean that 4% to 5% range with COVID moved it around volatility-wise, but it has been in that range for decades.And then all of a sudden, we know -- if you look at TDS, the same -- you look at July of last summer, and you see a very sharp deceleration in the market like GLP-1s or cannabis is not going to take a market and move it 4 or 5 points seemingly overnight. And so I just don't think that's what is -- I don't think those big macro concerns that are out there are what is impacting the market today. Now over the next decade or 2, do I want to look at that and understand that better. It is -- it could be a headwind, yes. But particularly on a healthier Gen Z kind of conversation. Cannabis, that's been around now for -- I don't even know, 10-plus years, whatever it is. We studied that 18 ways until Sunday and have never been able to find a state where we saw reduced alcohol consumption based on going legal, and it's tough to do now because so many places are legal. But -- so yes, so I do think, in general, these are shorter-term challenges, particularly the U.S., but it's also true in Europe to Europe is feeling a lot of the same macro factors in the U.S. is. And I do think that it's the combination of what we've already talked about, but the very difficult comps. I think the consumer is weaker than it was, say, this time last year. But now predicting is the turnaround going to be 6 months or 12 months, I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball on that. But I am a believer that the macro factors impacting our business are more short term in nature than these big macro headwinds."", 'Nadine Sarwat', 'Got it. And just to confirm that getting back to 4% to 5% next year comment with that next year fiscal or calendar?', 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""I don't know if I was kind of -- I'm not making it up, but I mean it's more of a return to normal over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months in our world, something like that."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. And then the one thing that we looked at is in history is not always a predictor of the future for many reasons we know. When we went and looked back at the last time the consumer was really stretched with macroeconomic factors we looked at 2000, 2001, 2008, 2009. And they were followed by really strong years of growth. And those trends were when they were negatively impacted were much shorter, unlike Lawson just said, it's kind of the 12- to 18-month window by which we're already in it. So none of us know, but that's what history has said to us."", 'Operator', 'One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.', 'Eric Adam Serotta', ""First of all, I'm hoping you could expand upon your comments earlier on pricing and promotions. First, I guess, as a housekeeping item, when did your pricing in the U.S. particularly on Jack Daniel's go in? And then I know you said that the -- those are not seeing much pricing in the data, but it does seem like it's more than kind of one-off anecdotal or the anecdotal reports about discounting seem to be more than one off. I know Diageo mentioned some increased promotions in the U.S. Just wondering if you have any broader perspective between what seems to be a broader theme of increased promotions and what you guys are seeing in the data."", 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""Yes. Well, on the -- pricing history, I guess, when did it kick in? It was if we're talking about the U.S., it was about 3 years ago now. So we have chosen, I think, a slightly different path than some of our competitors. We've talked about this numerous times, but it's kind of that low and slow. And it's what I want to see continuing going forward and is what we're trying to strive in even over the next 12 or 24 months. And that's a U.S. comment for the most part, but it actually does apply to much of the rest of the world, too. Europe has had pretty healthy price increases in the last couple of years, too, which is collectively why we -- one of the main reasons why we've been able to improve our gross margin. And so I have very little interest in giving that back. And so we're going to continue to be pretty strong with that.As I mentioned earlier, I mean, I know anecdotally, it feels that way, and I've heard the same things, and I saw what some of our competitors have said. But the reality is it's not coming through the data. So I don't know sure how else to answer that. I mean we talked about trade down earlier, a couple of questions ago or the lack of, I should say. So it's not coming through and trade down the year, and we're not seeing it in terms of really individual brands that have all of a sudden gone deep. And by the way, I think it's worth probably commenting to, and this is a very high level. So I have personally -- we're not deep studying this quite yet. But the competitive some of the brands that have gone lower haven't seen much in the way of a decent rebound in their volume. I'm just not sure these -- I'm not sure that's the core consumer problem right now is higher pricing. Pricing elasticity are, as I said, low and slow, but if you compare pricing changes over the last 2, 3 years to what grocery has done to what other consumer categories have done where it was much more -- you saw much higher inflation in the food channel, let's say, than you did in spirits. And so I just -- I don't think -- I'm not that worried that our pricing actions have chased consumers away from our products. I just don't -- I think that will be sort of missing what the actual problem is."", 'Eric Adam Serotta', ""Great. And then just one other question. I'm hoping to get your perspective on either Brown-Forman or industry barrel whiskey inventories obviously been a massive investment cycle over the past decade, making up for the previous for 4 decades. But maybe, hopefully, you could give some comments as to where you think inventories are today relative to future demand, realizing you've got a plan for multi-decade cycles here?"", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. So I'll talk about our barrel whiskey inventory. And I think for anybody who's followed us for a while, you've probably heard us say that we have a very robust semiannual process where we're always adjusting to future consumer demand outlook. And with doing that, we capture the change in trends if there are any. So when you look at our barrel whiskey, we're constantly adjusting it. When you look at our balance sheet, when you see increases for us there. It is about looking out over the long term, and that represents our future growth expectations.And you probably -- with work in process, also in some brands, you would find our aging inventories there. And we -- with the acquisition of Diplomatico you would have seen that increase as well. So for many in the industry. I don't want to speak on anybody's behalf but many in the industry use not the same proprietary way of doing the work, but I know that they often look at their long-term demand over that cycle as well. So I think people are always adjusting."", 'Operator', 'One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. You may proceed.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So I guess I'm a bit confused by the commentary on the top line trajectory. So on one hand, you're talking about a normalization of category growth. And you'd expect that to get back to that mid-single-digit growth at some point over the next 12 to 18 months. And that would kind of seem to imply that '25 could be another challenging year. But on the other hand, if you back out the distributor inventory headwind, which sounds like you expect to be largely complete after 4Q. You're kind of already at this mid-single-digit growth rate. So I know we'll get to fiscal '25 in June. But how should we think about the building blocks for your organic growth outlook for over the next 12 to 18 months. Should we focus more on that category growth rate? Or should we be kind of focusing on kind of lapping this distributor inventory headwinds?"", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. So as excited as we are to begin to talk about our next fiscal year, we'll have that in full detail for you in our next call."", 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""But I do think you picked up on an important point. If you look at that depletion schedule or Schedule D, if you assume that we're there from an inventory perspective, certainly, depletions are better than certainly a lot better than shipments over this year. So we're getting there. We're getting capacities comps. I mean there's like light at the end of the tunnel. We can't get there fast enough, but we're almost there."", 'Peter K. Grom', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on gross margin. I know a lot of moving pieces here, and Lawson, I appreciate the commentary on the year-to-date progress. But from a quarterly perspective, you would have to really go back to kind of the tariff date to see a sequential step down of this magnitude in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. Was that simply a function of a weaker volume performance? Or was there something else that drove that kind of sequential step down?"", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""Yes. So when we think about our gross margin and the outlook that we have driven by a couple of things. So one, we lapped supply chain disruption. And largely speaking, we had the majority of the cost in our second quarter of last year. So that benefit continues to moderate as we move through the rest of the year. And then just as we do kind of estimates from an inventory costing perspective, we would have had a benefit in our fourth quarter of last year that we will have to comp this year. But all of that has been built into our full year guidance for the entire year where you've been able to see kind of the difference between our top line growth estimates and our operating income and the leverage that we've expected through there. But we have been very happy to return to gross margin expansion and have the strong expansion that we've had through the 9 months to date. But again, talking about in that last quarter, it will go more towards the guidance that we have provided."", 'Operator', 'One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', 'I have a question on the ready-to-drink spirits part of the category, particularly in the U.S. If you look at total Spirits categories stripping out, ready to drink actually, the trends have been a lot more negative than it looks on the surface. So do you think this growth in the ready-to-drink spirits is more structural? And have you done any work of calculating any impact on your volumes given, obviously, you sell less liquid in registered drink compared to like a full bottle if that were to continue to grow at this rate? And following up on the margin part, you talked in the past about ready-to-drink spirits being more of gross margin dilutive, although more similar at the operating margin level. So any thought on the margin implications would be helpful.', 'Lawson E. Whiting', ""Well, your first part of that was the TDS. And yes, you're right, RTDs are boosting TDS for sure. You take those out and it's closer to flat, which honestly is close to flat -- it's been 30-plus years since TDS has gone negative in the United States, not since the early 1990s when they had the excise tax changes. So from a pure TDS takeaway U.S. figure, it's about as bad as it's been what it is as bad as it's been in my career. So there are certainly challenges there. Now do I think there's this big structural move in the world of RTDs. One, I mean, they meet a lot of consumer trends and needs right now. So I do believe it's a very powerful category. But if you go back over the last 20 or 30 years, and you look through our industry, there have been so many booms and busts of different brands that we always start out by talking about California Cooler 30 years at Brown-Forman -- 30 years ago on it went from 12 million cases to 0 in about 2 years. So I mean there are booms and busts in that space. Jack & Cola is a little part -- Jack & Coke is a bit different in that it's such an established strength already. It's the largest bar crawl in the world. That is not a [fact] in my mind. There are other brands we'll see. We've seen what happened to the mall-based RTDs over the last few years and that category got blown up largely by the spirit-based RTDs. So it's -- it's a volatile space for sure."", 'Leanne D. Cunningham', ""And then to your -- the liquid part and the margin part of your question, from liquid, yes, there is less liquid in the case of RTDs, of course, then the full strength but we will be planning to supply liquid to significantly broader geographic reach with this product. Again, and we just talked about the process that we use and looking for the demand needed for liquid. So that would be built into there. And then from a margin perspective, though, gross margins for RTDs are lower than our company average. Jack & Coke should be higher than the rest of our RTD portfolio because we will have advertising support jointly funded between Brown-Forman and the Coca-Cola Company. And we have to look at it in totality of when we're increasing our RTD business that we're also adding in the two super and ultra-premium brands of Gin Mare and Diplomatico, which have higher gross margins than the company. So you'll have to take all of those factors into account."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Sue Perram for any closing remarks.', 'Susanne J.

HOLX and its subsidiary, Biotheranostics, recently presented new research findings. The results suggest that in the absence of Breast Cancer Index (BCI) genetic testing, a significant proportion of early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer survivors may have received excessive or insufficient treatment. The study was published in the March issue of the JNCCN — Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.', 'Previous research has shown that most women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer do not benefit from extended anti-estrogen therapy, although some may experience a lower risk of recurrence.\xa0 When it comes to predicting which women may benefit from continuing anti-estrogen therapy after five years, the BCI test is the only genomic test that is approved by various national oncology guidelines. This helps optimize the length of treatment.', 'Participants in the BCI Registry Study include patients and doctors in this investigation. More than 3,000 individuals were enrolled in the study by the time it ended and they will be monitored for 10 years after their diagnosis.', 'The study finding implies that BCI has a crucial role in identifying women whose anti-estrogen therapy may be stopped after the first five years to prevent any negative consequences and toxicities related to prolonged treatment.', 'The finding emphasizes another crucial application of BCI, which is to identify women who would benefit from longer treatment to help prevent a potentially fatal metastatic recurrence. In the past, lengthier therapy might not have been advised based only on clinical and pathologic risk factors.', 'The study findings support the usefulness of the Breast Cancer Index test in clinical settings even further. The Breast Cancer Index is a handy tool that gives physicians more confidence in their treatment decisions for patients with breast cancer. It helps prevent over- and undertreatment for extended anti-estrogen therapy.', ""The recently presented findings show that BCI can boost clinicians' assurance in their treatment recommendations when integrated into standard clinical care. Of the providers surveyed, 39% stated that BCI testing augmented their confidence in their recommendation for prolonged anti-estrogen therapy."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Furthermore, 41% of patients felt more at ease with their treatment choices after undergoing BCI testing and 45% of patients changed their minds about continuing anti-estrogen therapy for an additional five years.', 'Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the Global Breast Cancer Screening test market size is estimated at $2.95 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $4.45 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 8.55%.

In the past six months, the stock has appreciated 29.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 20.6%.Let’s delve into the factors that make this company investment-worthy at the moment.Strength in Businesses: Ingersoll Rand should benefit from its solid product portfolio, innovation capabilities and focus on boosting aftermarket businesses. The company continues to see higher orders across its product portfolio of compressors within the Industrial Technologies & Services unit. Also, the company expects orders for industrial vacuum and blower to improve moving ahead. For 2024, IR expects total revenues to increase 5-7% from the year-ago levels, while organic revenues are estimated to grow 2-4%.Benefits From Acquisitions: The company’s acquisition of Friulair (February 2024) is expected to boost its air dryer business and add new chiller production capabilities, thereby boosting its Industrial Technologies and Services segment. The buyout enhanced IRs presence across food and beverage, and pharmaceutical end markets. In October 2023, the company acquired Slovakia-based Oxywise and Canada-based Fraserwoods, boosting its capabilities in the high-growth, sustainable end markets. Also, its acquisition of Howden Roots (in August 2023) expanded its compression and vacuum product offerings.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Vulcan Materials (VMC), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Vulcan Materials currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if VMC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this construction materials company holds up."", 'A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.', ""For VMC, shares are up 3.97% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry is up 0.27% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 14.42% compares favorably with the industry's 8.13% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Vulcan Materials have increased 19.95% over the past quarter, and have gained 49.51% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.5% and 27.19%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of VMC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, VMC is averaging 929,840 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with VMC."", ""Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VMC's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.99 to $8.26 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that VMC is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Vulcan Materials on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As of Dec 31, 2023, it had 404 active aggregates facilities, 71 asphalt facilities, 142 concrete facilities and one calcium facility.', ""VMC boasts a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis on why a wealth of experience is not enough and how your American dollars might be your gateway to a comfortable retirement, go to 5 Best Places to Retire If You Have No Savings.', ""As the demographic landscape of the United States shifts, marked by the Baby Boomer generation entering retirement and Millennials contemplating their financial futures more earnestly, the conversation around retirement is more relevant than ever. Particularly pressing is the topic of the best places to retire if you have no savings, a reality for a significant portion of the population. According to a troubling statistic from the National Institute on Retirement Security, approximately 40% of Gen Xers have no retirement savings whatsoever. This stark number underscores the critical importance of planning for financial sustainability in later life, especially against a backdrop where the cost of living continues to climb. In this environment, identifying the best places to retire involves a delicate balance between manageable living expenses and access to essential services like healthcare. The increasing cost of living and healthcare expenses across the country bring these considerations to the forefront of retirement planning for financially under prepared Americans. As we step into 2024, retirees are facing a mixed financial landscape, marked by slight improvements in Social Security benefits but countered by rising healthcare costs and pressing concerns about the adequacy of retirement savings. The latest data from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) reveals that Social Security recipients now have a 3.2% increase in their monthly payments, thanks to the 2024 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This adjustment raises the average retirement benefit from $1,848 to $1,907, a modest but welcome $59 boost per month that reflects attempts to keep pace with inflation, albeit at a slower rate than the previous year's 8.7% increase. However, this financial relief is somewhat tempered by the news from the Medicare sector. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, after a 3% decrease in 2023, the standard premiums for Medicare Part B are up for a 6% climb starting 2024, with the monthly premium reaching $174.70. This increase, combined with the raised annual deductible for Medicare Part B to $240, may erode the benefits of the COLA adjustment for many beneficiaries. The healthcare and insurance sectors play critical roles in this evolving scenario. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a leading healthcare public company, and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), a prominent insurer, are at the forefront of addressing these challenges. Both\xa0 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) have a significant influence on how healthcare services and insurance products adapt to meet the needs of an aging population, particularly as these companies work to manage the balance between coverage and cost."", '""Given all the stresses in the world today, such as natural disasters and geopolitical events, Americans continue to confront challenging times in our economy"". -Kevin Barry, the President of Workplace Investing at Fidelity.', ""This statement lays the groundwork for understanding the financial backdrop against which retirees are navigating. According to Clever, a real estate data company, an alarming 37% of retirees’ report having no savings set aside for retirement, with the average retiree holds $170,726 in savings, a noticeable decline from $191,659 in 2022. This reduction in savings, coupled with nearly 48 % of retirees fearing they will outlive their retirement funds and 71% carrying non-mortgage debt averaging $19,888, paints a concerning picture. Barry's words serve as a crucial reminder of the multifaceted pressures compounding the financial insecurities faced by today's retirees, underlining the urgent need for strategic planning and support to navigate these challenging economic waters. In response, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) are pivotal in developing healthcare and insurance solutions that strive to alleviate some of the financial strains on retirees. Their efforts to offer comprehensive healthcare plans and insurance products that cater specifically to the needs of the elderly can play a vital role in helping manage the dual challenges of rising healthcare costs and insufficient retirement savings. As 2024 unfolds, the importance of strategic financial planning and the support of the healthcare and insurance sectors becomes increasingly clear. Given the economic landscape, the search for the best places to retire if you have no savings is more than just a financial consideration; it's a question of how to maintain a dignified, comfortable lifestyle on a limited budget. This search necessitates looking beyond traditional retirement paradigms, exploring locales where the cost of living aligns more closely with fixed incomes typical of Social Security benefits."", 'In our quest to uncover the best places to retire if you have no savings, we embarked on an extensive research process, leveraging data from sources such as Nomadguide, Think Advisor, and VivEurope.

Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is UNH Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for UnitedHealth, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0% over the past month to $27.82.', ""Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for UnitedHealth.

If you want to skip our discussion on the aviation industry, head over to 5 Best Aviation Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\xa0', 'The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released its outlook for the airline industry in December last year, projecting a higher profitability trajectory for full-year 2023 with further stabilization anticipated in 2024. The overall aviation landscape in 2024 is expected to witness a notable increase in revenues, which will outweigh expenses. Industry revenues are forecasted to reach a historic high of $964 billion, fueled by a growth rate of 7.6%, while expenses are projected to rise at a slightly slower pace of 6.9%. This positive trajectory is expected to strengthen the profitability of the airline sector. Passenger revenues are a significant driver of this growth, anticipated to reach $717 billion in 2024, marking a 12% increase from the previous year. ', 'On the cargo front, revenues are projected to decline to $111 billion in 2024. This decrease is attributed to the impact of increased belly capacity on the passenger side of the business, coupled with stagnation in international trade. IATA listed down several factors that pose both positive and negative risks to the fragile profitability of the aviation industry. Global economic developments, including inflation, low unemployment rates, and demand for travel, are considered positive factors. However, economic strains in regions like China, if not managed properly, could impact global business cycles. Additionally, ongoing conflicts, such as the Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, have operational and cost implications for the industry, particularly in terms of oil prices.', 'Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, commented:\xa0', '“Considering the major losses of recent years, the $25.7 billion net profit expected in 2024 is a tribute to aviation’s resilience. People love to travel and that has helped airlines to come roaring back to pre-pandemic levels of connectivity. The speed of the recovery has been extraordinary; yet it also appears that the pandemic has cost aviation about four years of growth. From 2024 the outlook indicates that we can expect more normal growth patterns for both passenger and cargo. Industry profits must be put into proper perspective. While the recovery is impressive, a net profit margin of 2.7% is far below what investors in almost any other industry would accept. Of course, many airlines are doing better than that average, and many are struggling. But there is something to be learned from the fact that, on average airlines will retain just $5.45 for every passenger carried. That’s about enough to buy a basic ‘grande latte’ at a London Starbucks. But it is far too little to build a future that is resilient to shocks for a critical global industry on which 3.5% of GDP depends and from which 3.05 million people directly earn their livelihoods. Airlines will always compete ferociously for their customers, but they remain far too burdened by onerous regulation, fragmentation, high infrastructure costs and a supply chain populated with oligopolies.”', 'Fitch Ratings has a Neutral outlook for the global airline sector in 2024. Despite global traffic approaching pre-pandemic levels, it still lags behind historical trends. Fitch also observed Chinese international traffic is notably below 2019 levels but has potential for growth. Business travel, which faced challenges in 2023, is displaying signs of recovery. Additionally, full-service carriers are expected to sustain positive trends in premium products, experiencing notable growth post-pandemic.\xa0', ""The airline industry has been experiencing waves of M&A activity recently. Airline consolidation is a common and essential strategy for growth and competitiveness, as demonstrated by Alaska Airlines' announcement to acquire Hawaiian Airlines for $1.9 billion back in December 2023. This move is not just a business transaction but a strategic positioning for future growth in the highly competitive and concentrated airline sector. Upon completion of the deal, the combined market share of Alaska and Hawaiian will be around 8.2%, making them the fifth-largest U.S. airline, unless JetBlue Airways successfully acquires Spirit Airlines.\xa0"", 'Some of the best airline stocks to buy in order to benefit from the growth potential in the aviation industry include Delta Air Lines, Inc.

This strategy efficiently allocates capital to buy out external shareholders at discounted prices. Remaining investors win big through accelerated earnings per share growth.', 'As investing legend Charlie Munger wisely advised, “Pay attention to the cannibals.” He was referring to cash-rich firms with share prices trading below intrinsic value. By concentrating ownership amongst fewer outstanding shares, buyback stocks directly boost shareholder returns.', 'Below are three inflation-resilient buyback stocks poised to supercharge EPS as runaway market leaders in their industries. Specifically, these are high-quality, low-CAPEX companies with strong underlying businesses that can thrive amid economic uncertainty. Critically, these stocks boast substantial cash reserves to fund massive repurchases while remaining undervalued. For example, if a company earns $10 per share and buys back 50% of outstanding shares, EPS doubles to $20 per share. Consequently, the stock price should follow suit.

AutoZone bought back $900 million of its shares in 2022 alone.', 'Financially, AutoZone is in a strong position to continue these repurchases with a profitable business even in inflationary times. The company achieved record sales and earnings per share in fiscal 2022. With steady top-line growth expected and shares outstanding declining 7-9% annually, earnings per share could grow at an accelerated pace. AutoZone’s consistent history of buying back sizable amounts of shares makes it a favorite Wall Street buyback stock pick for big upside in 2024 and beyond.

The sales improvement mainly stemmed from strong comparable store sales (comps) performance.

CFO Burt Podbere\xa0noted that CrowdStrike has been reporting a GAAP net income over the past four quarters,', 'CrowdStrike guided for\xa0revenue between $902 million and $906 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $899 million, and providing the earnings per share outlook in the range between\xa089\xa0cents and 90 cents, also topping the consensus estimate of 82 cents.', 'Over the recent months, CrowdStrike has been stepping up its M&A game.', 'CrowdStrike is doing a great job at navigating the competitive environment as it targets the cloud as its next major growth area, with CEO George Kurtz acknowledging that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) will always be a competitive threat. After all, Microsoft is trusted by the world’s biggest enterprises in part due to its promise of security. However, even Microsoft has had a few rough years of cybersecurity incidents. Fortunately, as technology continues to evolve, there can never be enough of cybersecurity so being a Microsoft customer does not exclude also being a CrowdStrike customer. Besides Microsoft Azure, there’s also Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) who ended 2023 by revealing its new AI security assistant. With this major milestone, Cisco is aiming to redefine cybersecurity defense with powerful AI capabilities. Claiming to have unmatched visibility across the network, Cisco trained its AI assistant on one of the largest security-focused data set. Cisco revealed its AI Assistant analyzes more than 550 billion security events each day. Therefore, with the AI Assistant, Cisco aims to tip the scales in favor of defenders by helping organizations make informed decisions. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, defenses must do the same and therefore, CrowdStrike is set to benefit from its M&A activities. With the release, CrowdStrike also announced its acquisition of Flow which will expand its reach in cloud security.', 'Moreover, Podbere reiterated the company’s goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of the decade, having now reached\xa0$3.4 billion\xa0for the year that ended this January.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The company grew its revenue an incredible 265% in Q4 to $22.1 billion, with Data Center revenue soaring 409% to $18.4 billion. And with Nvidia's growth, investors have benefited, with the stock more than tripling over the past year."", 'The AI revolution has led to comparisons between the Internet boom and bust. Not surprisingly, the company Nvidia is most compared to is Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), which was the backbone of the Internet.', ""Cisco became the world's most valuable company in 2000, but its stock crashed soon afterwards and Cisco investors never fully recovered. The stock still trades well below its all-time high today."", 'So, can Nvidia and its investors avoid the same fate as Cisco investors?', 'In many ways, the rise of Nvidia is reminiscent of Cisco back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. During that period, Cisco was the leader in providing the infrastructure equipment used to power the Internet boom through its network routers, much like Nvidia is powering the AI revolution through its GPUs today.', 'And like Nvidia, Cisco in 2000 was primarily a hardware business. This is important because software revenue is more recurring and higher margin. As a result, investors typically assign higher multiples to software businesses. Neither Nvidia nor Cisco are primarily software businesses, and their multiples should reflect this.', ""While Nvidia and Cisco in 2000 share these similarities, there are key differences. One is that Nvidia's Cuda software platform has been a key differentiator for the company since it was introduced in 2006, even though Nvidia gives it away for free."", 'This software platform allows Nvidia GPUs to be programmed directly, saving customers time and money. By the time alternatives evolved, Nvidia GPUs had already become the industry standard. This created a wide moat for the company. Investors like wide moat businesses as these companies face less competition.', 'Cisco in 2000 was just starting to get more meaningfully into software with the introduction of its CiscoWorks2000 network management software when its stock peaked. Today, software is about a third of its revenue.', ""Nvidia and Cisco's customer bases are also quite different. Cisco was heavily selling into the cable and telecom industries, where companies typically carry meaningful leverage and have unpredictable capex cycles. Capex is the purchase of assets meant to be used over a long period. Nvidia is selling into the data center, where cash-flush companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) preside. This gives Nvidia a more stable customer base, which is another positive for investors."", 'CSCO data by YCharts', 'Nvidia also trades at a much lower valuation than Cisco did at its peak in March 2000. At its highs, Cisco had a nearly 200x P/E ratio. .', ""Nvidia, meanwhile, trades at around 60x P/E, and has been growing its revenue more quickly. In 2023, Nvidia's revenue surged 126%, while Cisco's revenue rose 55% in its fiscal year 2000. Investors generally assign larger multiples for high revenue growth, and there are few companies growing as quickly as Nvidia."", 'The biggest risk Nvidia faces is one that eventually hurt Cisco: demand suddenly drying up after the initial order surge. In 2001, Cisco took a large inventory write-off because in the race to meet insatiable demand, it acquired too much inventory and then demand suddenly dropped off. This was essentially Cisco saying the components it purchased to build its networking equipment were now basically worthless.', 'Currently, there seems no end in sight for GPU demand as companies build out their AI infrastructure. However, Cisco in 2000 believed there was no end in sight to the demand for networking routers. That outlook did not end well for Cisco investors.', 'Nvidia also has a bit more customer concentration than Cisco did in 2000, with one indirect customer representing 19% of sales in 2023. Customer concentration adds more risk, because if a large a customer pulls back on spending, it can lead to a negative earnings surprise, which tends to put pressure on stocks.', ""Nvidia is currently one of the best growth stories in the market. While there are similarities between it and Cisco 2000, they are also key differences. Nvidia is also much cheaper than where Cisco was when it peaked and it's been growing faster. Investors need to be aware of the risks, but AI still appears to be in the early innings. After all, AI wasn't a huge topic of conversation a few years ago, and now nearly every company is talking about it. Investors can continue to ride Nvidia's great growth, but just be aware it might not last forever."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cisco Systems wasn’t one of them.

I am as proud of my company for making such a commitment to this cause as I am of my team of colleagues, customers, suppliers, and partners that work together to make this body of work come alive. I am also struck by the need to help frame social justice in a way that resonates globally.', 'Understanding social justice from a broader perspective', 'Over the course of my involvement in this work, I have spent equal parts of my time doing the work and learning about social justice both as a set of practices and as an ideal. Most of my exposure to the topic had come from my own history in civil rights and political activism, life experience (there were still partially segregated school districts in my home state when I attended elementary school), and reading authors/thought leaders like Howard Zinn, David Walker, Michelle Alexander, Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. duBois.', 'While their writing examined social justice through an anti-racist lens, I noticed common themes as I started to look at social justice from a broader perspective.', 'Access: all people having equal access to resources such as healthcare, education, and employment.', 'Equity: providing resources to people that are proportionate to what they need in order to thrive.', 'Participation: involving people in the decisions that govern their lives.', 'Human Rights: ensuring the civil, political, economic, cultural, and social rights of all people are protected and valued equally.', 'These themes provide a framework for how we can expand our perspective around social justice. Words and their definitions matter. Framing social justice as access, equity, participation, and human rights allows us to transcend the notion that social justice is simply about race.', 'Origins and early themes in social justice', ""In my research, I found there were themes around social justice that go all the way back to philosophers like Plato, Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke. There is also a strong current of social justice in many of the world's major religions."", 'One of the earliest thinkers in this space was Luigi Taparelli, who was an advisor to the Vatican in 1840. He believed society should not be seen as a monolith, but as a collective of different groups, all of which have rights that needed to be recognized. He is generally credited as the first to use the phrase ""social justice"" and saw it as an economic and class issue as opposed to a racial one.', 'The UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights', 'Building on this foundation in part led to the UN Charter in 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 which focused on political, civil, social, and economic rights. As many African nations were still under colonial rule at this time, they had limited input to the Declaration.', 'While this was problematic for a number of reasons, it does explain the anti-racist focus of many social justice programs and initiatives that would come later and how race played a key role in the access to those rights. The UN would start to use the term ""social justice"" heavily in the 1960s, and much of the work of the modern Civil Rights movement and much of the work around affirmative action and later diversity and inclusion efforts seemed to focus in this area.', ""The global perspective and Cisco's journey for social justice"", 'As we continue the work of social justice here at Cisco, we know that many corporations have rolled back some initiatives that were receiving support just a few years ago. This trend is happening across the globe and underpins what history has already shown us-social justice is global.', 'Just as the UN believes that social justice is an underlying principle for peaceful and prosperous coexistence within and among nations, Cisco believes that social justice is integral to our purpose to power an inclusive future for all.', 'A global perspective will inform us - and empower us - as we move forward in our social justice journey. Our focus is on access, equity, participation, and human rights. For all.', 'Words matter. We can choose the ones that shape us. Inspire us. And propel us forward.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.
