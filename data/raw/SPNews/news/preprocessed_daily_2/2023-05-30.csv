(NASDAQ:VRSK)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-verisk-140029998.html,1685368829,STORY,['VRSK'],"[Let's talk about the popular Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Verisk Analytics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics What's The Opportunity In Verisk Analytics?Verisk Analytics appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Verisk Analytics’s ratio of 41.96x is above its peer average of 20.68x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Professional Services industry. Furthermore, Verisk Analytics’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach levels around its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What does the future of Verisk Analytics look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 21% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Verisk Analytics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? VRSK’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe VRSK should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on VRSK for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for VRSK, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. While conducting our analysis, we found that Verisk Analytics has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.If you are no longer interested in Verisk Analytics, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

1,9921db59-0e66-3fa6-98f6-4c4acc3b5013,SCHW,2023-05-30,Is Trending Stock The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-charles-schwab-corporation-130010243.html,1685365210,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this company have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which The Charles Schwab Corporation belongs, has lost 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to post earnings of $0.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -14.1%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.25 indicates a change of +27% from what The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, The Charles Schwab Corporation is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SCHW _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.61 billion and $22.28 billion estimates indicate -5.6% and +13.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryThe Charles Schwab Corporation reported revenues of $5.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.15%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, The Charles Schwab Corporation surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.The Charles Schwab Corporation is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Charles Schwab Corporation. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,dfa6fd1e-0e83-3241-9892-1e02b5bc6f3e,TXN,2023-05-30,Institutional investors must be pleased after a 3.2% gain last week that adds to Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) one-year returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-must-pleased-3-130102447.html,1685365262,STORY,['TXN'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Texas Instruments implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 20 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$4.9b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 2.0%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Texas Instruments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Texas Instruments' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Texas Instruments. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.6% of shares outstanding. With 8.7% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$196m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Texas Instruments has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is potentially serious)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

3,ab1a0240-a10b-3d9b-a5f5-4be19f2ca101,UNM,2023-05-30,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154511137.html,1685375111,STORY,['UNM'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Unum in FocusBased in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 10.89%. The insurance company is paying out a dividend of $0.33 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.9% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.51% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.80%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 20%, meaning it paid out 20% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.41 per share, with earnings expected to increase 19.32% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,ce3a76e0-73bd-300c-bc2c-3f7d807c766e,UNM,2023-05-30,Here's Why You Should Invest in AMERISAFE (AMSF) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-invest-amerisafe-amsf-150100256.html,1685372460,STORY,"['AMSF', 'RLI', 'RZB', 'UNM']","[AMERISAFE, Inc. AMSF is well-poised to grow due to rising audit premiums and net investment income. Given the company’s experience in the high-hazard business, it expects to retain policyholders and attract new business in the future.AMERISAFE, with a market cap of $986.9 million, is a leading specialty provider of workers’ compensation insurance, which markets and underwrites its insurance through subsidiaries. The company focuses on providing coverage to small to mid-sized employers engaged in hazardous industries. It primarily operates in trucking, logging, construction, agriculture, maritime and other industries.Zacks Rank &amp; Price RallyAMERISAFE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its shares gained 5.3% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s 0.3% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReturn on Equity (ROE)ROE, a measure reflecting how efficiently a company utilizes shareholders’ money, was 16.9% in the trailing 12 months, better than the industry’s average of 15.2%.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMERISAFE’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $2.90 per share. It has witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against none in the opposite direction. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters.The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $303.8 million, indicating 1.5% growth from the prior-year reported figure.Business TailwindsDue to its vast experience as a provider of workers’ compensation insurance in hazardous industries and a disciplined risk selection approach, AMERISAFE fetches higher premiums. A rebounding economy, a decline in COVID-variant spikes and enhanced agent relations are likely to support its new business growth. Strong audit premiums are expected to drive premium revenues in the future.Net investment income is expected to gain from higher income from higher yields on fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents. The metric increased 21.6% in the first quarter.Story continuesThe company’s strong financial flexibility, with no debt and an increasing operating cash flow, is impressive. In the first quarter, the company generated an operating cash flow of $13.5 million, up 89.2% from the prior-year figure.The company’s financial flexibility allows it to engage in shareholder-friendly moves. The company handsomely returns capital to investors through share repurchases and dividends. It did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but paid a quarterly cash dividend of 34 cents per share. Its dividend yield matched that of the industry at 2.6%. As of Mar 31, 2023, $12.6 million was left under the authorized share buyback program.A Risk to Keep an Eye OnThere are a few factors that are impeding growth of AMSF. The company faces stiff market competition, which somewhat affects its pricing. Also, product concentration risks and elevated expenses level are concerning.Total expenses increased 5.1% year over year to $56.9 million in the first quarter. This can affect its future operations. Nevertheless, a systematic and strategic plan will drive AMSF’s long-term growth.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are Unum Group UNM, RLI Corp. RLI and Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated RGA. Each of these companies presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The bottom line of Unum Group outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 18.6%. The consensus mark for UNM’s 2023 earnings has moved 9.3% north in the past 30 days.The bottom line of RLI outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 43.5%. The consensus mark for RLI’s 2023 earnings has moved 6.6% north in the past 30 days.The bottom line of Reinsurance Group of America outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 56.9%.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) share price is up 73% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends).Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.2%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Edwards Lifesciences achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 1.0% in the last year, Edwards Lifesciences shareholders lost 19%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Edwards Lifesciences , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesWe will like Edwards Lifesciences better if we see some big insider buys.

Default risks are off the table for the next two can-kicking years.On paper, the resolution should bring some calm to debt markets and ratchet down the commentary coming from C-suite leaders at various investment bank conferences this week and in June.By no means is the deal perfect.One has to wonder how consumer spending will be impacted as the freeze on student loans gets lifted in early September as part of the agreement. And two, the government spending caps could take a bite out of the economy.But at least for today, a teensy bit of calm to a market that had grown jittery the past two weeks (see small-cap and defense stocks lagging, for instance).Don't get too comfortable, however.The market will now shift its gaze the Federal Reserve and whether it will lift interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Pros say it's a true toss up which direction the Fed will go, suggesting any debt ceiling market calm may prove short-lived.""In our view, the decision on whether to raise rates is so finely balanced that it could still go either way depending on how events unfold between now and the meeting,"" points out UBS senior economist Brian Rose. ""At one point, markets had almost completely priced out another hike, but currently the market sees around a 50% chance of one more hike, either at the June meeting or at the following meeting on 25–26 July.""There are strong cases for both.Inflation is still far above the Fed's 2% target and the unemployment rate is at a historically low 3.4%. The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report showed long-run inflation expectations near 20 year highs.If this Friday's May employment report hits above the consensus of around 200,000, it would be yet another data point to push the Fed into one more rate increase.Story continuesMarkets wouldn't like that, and could trade off into the June Fed meeting.On the other hand, the Fed has lifted rates 500 basis points from the lows. That's a lot of tightening, and it's beginning to show up in the economy.Consumers are cutting back on discretionary purchases, as we learned from earnings out of Target, Best Buy, Walmart, RH and Urban Outfitters last week. You will likely sense a similar vibe in earnings out this week from Dollar General and Macy's.Inflation has in fact trended lower.Auto delinquencies are on the rise, as closely followed Apollo Group economist Torsten Slok noted in a piece of weekend research that crossed my inbox.""The economy is balanced on a knife's edge,"" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told me last week on Yahoo Finance Live. ""When the Silicon Valley banking scare started, we saw a 15% overnight drop in business bookings, and that tells you the economy is very fragile.""These economic clues suggest that the Fed needs to chill out with rate hikes before it induces a recession, or worse.All in all, a tough call by the Fed soon.And that means it remains a tough call among bulls and bears...despite the debt ceiling debacle hibernating for two years.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Some say Union Square is 'beating strong',LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-exodus-san-francisco-union-120002973.html,1685361602,STORY,['JWN'],"[Union Square in San Francisco. Since 2020, at least 26 stores have closed in downtown, with seven more slated to shut down. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)Is Union Square in downtown San Francisco really dying?Nordstrom is shutting down its two stores in the area. Saks Off 5th is leaving. T-Mobile already closed its two-level flagship store.So why are these retailers in Union Square or near it saying goodbye to a well-known tourist destination and the heart of the city's shopping core? The exodus of these business has concerned some business leaders and economists alike.Reductions in consumer spending, disruptions in the supply chain, high operation costs and public safety have led the overall retail vacancy rate in San Francisco to rise to 6% in the first quarter of 2023 — up from 5.2% a year ago and the highest in the city since 2006, according to data from Cushman and Wakefield, a commercial real estate services firm.The overall vacancy rate in Union Square went up to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2023, up from 14.2% in the last quarter of 2022.“It’s a very serious problem for the whole city, much less downtown,” said Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.Read more: California's downtowns were emptied by COVID: S.F. still reeling but San Diego reboundsBut Mayor London Breed and other San Franciscans have pushed back against the narrative in recent media coverage that Union Square is doomed.“Those folks who don’t walk the streets in San Francisco, that don’t live in San Francisco, but they want to write about and commentate about San Francisco, I challenge you to come to this city and see what it feels like,” Breed said during a May 16 news conference. “I challenge you to come shop at the stores that you’re complaining about, which you probably never even stepped foot in in the first place.”Breed emphasized that media outlets aren’t covering the stores, such as Banana Republic and Ikea, that have moved or are planning to move into Union Square.At least 26 stores have closed in downtown San Francisco since 2020, with seven more slated to shut down.Story continuesThis month, Nordstrom announced that it would close its two stores on Fifth and Market streets, becoming the latest retailer to leave Union Square in the last few years.""The dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully,"" Jamie Nordstrom, the chief stores officer, said in a statement.Read more: Column: Sorry, San Francisco is not the crime-ridden hellhole the far right claims it isSaks Off 5th on Market Street is also shutting its doors, attributing the decision in a statement to ""store performance and other factors.""As for T-Mobile's recent closure at Stockton Street, a spokesperson said it was part of the company's ""nationwide retail strategy to better take care of customers.""Despite those businesses moving, Breed held a news conference a couple of weeks ago with District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin to announce a $6-million investment into the three blocks of Powell Street near Union Square where H&amp;M, Gap and Uniqlo have closed their doors in recent years.While Marisa Rodriguez, the CEO of Union Square Alliance, acknowledged that certainly some stores have left Union Square during and after the pandemic, she emphasized that luxury retailers in particular have expanded, opened or moved to the area.“The heart of the square is beating strong — it’s alive,” she said. “There certainly have been challenges postpandemic that a lot of major cities have been experiencing. We are trying to position ourselves to meet the moment and pivot where we can.”Read more: Stop the doom loop, I want to get off. Reports on San Francisco miss the big pictureSaint Laurent, Chanel and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels have all moved to Union Square, while Pandora opened its doors there last year.“When we shut down, we shut down pretty hard,” Rodriguez said. “Union Square is a visitor destination. We’re gonna see more closures than you would in a more traditional neighborhood setting where people can pivot and shop where they live. A lot of these closures are a result of not being able to survive that shutdown.”Storefronts in the shopping district have been emptying out in recent years due to the rise of internet shopping coupled with a reduction of foot traffic in the aftermath of the pandemic, according to Wade Rose, president of Advance SF, a business advocacy group.“This is an example of the pressure urban retail has been feeling as a result of how people buy things,” Rose said. “San Francisco is deeply engaged and dealing with that issue. There are roughly 300,000 less people in downtown San Francisco than there was in 2019.”The city's property crime and homelessness crisis have also deterred foot traffic, Rose said.Read more: Elon Musk, others claim San Francisco crime out of control.

In 2020, there were 1,107 incidents, compared with 945 in 2021 and 735 in 2022.Rose referred to San Francisco's Stonestown Mall as a shopping district pivoting to meet the needs of a population. The mall, he said, which was once very traditional and included a Macy's, fell on hard times and had to be reinvented. It now has a Trader Joe's, a Sports Basement and a Target.""It's thriving because it meets the needs of the neighborhood and has the type of metamorphosis that needs to happen in the downtown retail district,"" he said.

CZR is likely to benefit from solid Las Vegas performance, tech enhancements and capital development projects. However, weather-related headwinds pose concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Driving GrowthCaesars Entertainment has been benefiting from solid Las Vegas performance. In the third quarter of 2022, the company delivered encouraging revenues. During the quarter, net revenues in the Las Vegas segment came in at $1,131 million compared with $914 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to $533 million compared with $400 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by strong leisure, group and convention demand. Caesars Entertainment revealed that it began witnessing the pre-COVID return of conventions and groups to Las Vegas.The company is optimistic about booking trends as it is witnessing increased bookings for group and convention room nights. The company expects the return of the group and convention business and entertainment offerings to drive incremental demand in the Las Vegas market.Increased focus on digital initiatives bode well. During the first quarter of 2023, the company emphasized on certain tech enhancements to boost product offering and drive better customer engagement. This include a new standalone iCasino app (expected to launch during third-quarter 2023), testing of its in-house player account management system and migration of sports-betting operations in Nevada to its Liberty tech stack (ahead of the 2023 football season). The company emphasized on product enhancements, including cash-out speed, customer service, parlay and alternative line offerings to drive growth.The company is inclined on expanding in new markets to drive growth. It announced partnership with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to build and develop Caesars Virginia. Estimated at a budget of $650 million, the property will include a resort casino along with a 500-room hotel, casino floor a Caesars Sportsbook, a live entertainment theater and 40,000 square feet of meeting and convention space.Also, it stated plans to expand into Nebraska with the development of a Harrah’s casino and racetrack (during third-quarter 2023). The casino development is expected to feature a new one-mile horse racing surface, a 40,000-square-foot-casino and sportsbook and a restaurant and retail space. In spite of being in the construction phase, the company stated plans to open temporary facilities (for the properties) in 2023.Story continuesConcernsDuring the first quarter of 2023, the company reported disruptions in operations within the Regional segment. During the quarter, the regional segment was negatively impacted by severe winter weather, particularly in northern Nevada. It reported reduced visitation in Lake Tahoe and Reno properties on account of significant snowfall and unsafe travel conditions. Also, it witnessed increased competition from the opening of a new casino resorts in Chicagoland area and Philadelphia, PA.Although most properties are now open, traffic is lower than pre-pandemic levels. CZR is cautious of the economic trends, including higher inflation and interest rates.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -28.41% so far this year. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.52 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.01% compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.32% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.28%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, MetLife's payout ratio is 32%, which means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MET is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.83 per share, with earnings expected to increase 14.31% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Imperial Petroleum:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$65m ÷ (US$400m - US$47m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Imperial Petroleum has an ROCE of 18%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Oil and Gas industry average of 23%. Check out our latest analysis for Imperial Petroleum roceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Imperial Petroleum's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you'd like to look at how Imperial Petroleum has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Can We Tell From Imperial Petroleum's ROCE Trend?Imperial Petroleum has recently broken into profitability so their prior investments seem to be paying off. The company was generating losses three years ago, but now it's earning 18% which is a sight for sore eyes. In addition to that, Imperial Petroleum is employing 150% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.Story continuesFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 12% of the business, which is more than it was three years ago. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.The Key TakeawayIn summary, it's great to see that Imperial Petroleum has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And since the stock has fallen 55% over the last year, there might be an opportunity here. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.If you want to know some of the risks facing Imperial Petroleum we've found 4 warning signs (3 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this investment bank have returned -6.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share, indicating a change of +11.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%. This estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.47 indicates a change of +14.4% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $13.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $55.03 billion and $57.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $14.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.70 for the same period compares with $2.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +1.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

26,cc3d76f5-ce33-38ef-a6c9-16f7958f8c37,FLS,2023-05-30,Ingersoll Rand (IR) Gains 13% YTD: Will the Momentum Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ingersoll-rand-ir-gains-13-140400033.html,1685369040,STORY,"['IR', 'FLS', 'GGG']","[Shares of Ingersoll Rand IR have gained approximately 13% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s 3% increase. The upside can be linked to solid underlying demand and benefits from successive acquisitions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCatalysts Behind the Increase in Share PriceSolid product portfolio, innovation capabilities and focus on boosting aftermarket businesses are driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growth. Solid demand and higher orders across the product portfolio of compressors and power tools and lifting are aiding the Industrial Technologies &amp; Services segment. For 2023, the company expects segmental revenues to increase 6-8% organically. Ingersoll Rand’s Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment is benefiting from pricing actions and acquired assets. Acquisitions had a positive impact of 2.4% on the unit’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023. The company anticipates Precision &amp; Science Technologies revenues to climb 5-7% organically in 2023.With underlying demand remaining solid despite market uncertainties, Ingersoll Rand has raised its full-year guidance. For 2023, IR expects total revenues to increase 10-12% compared with a rise of 7-9% predicted earlier. Organic revenues are estimated to increase 6-8% compared with 3-5% increase expected earlier.Adjusted earnings are anticipated to be $2.64-$2.74 per share for 2023. This indicates an increase of 11-16% year over year.  The company expected adjusted earnings of $2.48-$2.58 per share earlier.Ingersoll Rand’s measures to expand market presence, solidify customer base and enhance product offerings through acquisitions hold promise. In first-quarter 2023, acquisitions contributed 5.8% to total revenues. In January 2023, the company completed the acquisition of SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business, boosting its core compressor product offering through a complementary product portfolio of energy-efficient compressed air dryers, filters and other consumables. The Air Treatment business is a part of IR’s Industrial Technologies and Services (IT&amp;S) segment.The acquisition of Dosatron International (October 2022) expanded Ingersoll Rand’s digital technology portfolio, opening up opportunities in hydroponics, horticulture, animal health, food safety and sanitation, along with water treatment end markets, where Dosatron had a strong presence. The company is a part of Ingersoll Rand’s Precision and Science Technologies (PST) segment. The acquisition of Westwood Technical Limited (September 2022) expanded its PST segment’s IIoT (industrial internet of things) offerings with Westwood Technical’s Aircom product line. Its acquisition of Houdstermaatschappij Jorc (February 2022) has expanded the IT&amp;S segment’s product offerings. For 2023, Ingersoll Rand anticipates buyouts/mergers to contribute $270 million to total revenues.Ingersoll Rand’s commitment to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks also drove its shares higher. In 2022, the company returned $294 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In the first quarter of 2023, the company returned $85 million to shareholders through $77 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. Strong free cash flow generation supports the company’s shareholder-friendly activities. In 2022, free cash flow increased 36.7% year over year to $770.8 million. In the first quarter of 2023, free cash flow of $148 million jumped more than 350% year over year.Story continuesWill the Momentum Continue?Ingersoll Rand is likely to benefit from improving supply chains in 2023. While the manufacturing sector remains weak, the recent uptick in manufacturing activities signals improvement in demand across several end markets. This augurs well for IR. The acquisition of SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business is expected to boost the IR’s top line in 2023.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked companies within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Flowserve FLS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

This week’s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL and Meta META.Q1 Earnings: Can A.I. Sustain Momentum?The analysts covering Nvidia are struggling to come up with superlatives to describe the chipmaker’s blockbuster quarterly results. Coming into Nvidia’s May 26th quarterly numbers, many analysts saw some upside to consensus estimates, given the company’s AI leverage. But the stock had already doubled this year before the Wednesday release on those AI hopes.It is humbling to acknowledge that I thought the stock was ‘priced for perfection’ and was skeptical that Nvidia could do anything in the quarterly numbers that could satisfy those lofty expectations. Keep in mind that we fall in the Nvidia ‘fan club,’ having held the stock in the Zacks Focus List portfolio since May 2019.The stock’s performance since the quarterly release is in a class of its own, and for good reasons. In the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, Nvidia raised Q2 revenue guidance by more than +50% on the back of robust data-center demand reflecting momentum in generative AI and large language models. Importantly, Nvidia indicated a high degree of visibility in these demand trends over the coming quarters.There are legitimate questions as to how sustainable this growth trajectory will prove to be and whether Nvidia will be able to protect its first-mover advantage as the competitive landscape heats up over time.We have all glimpsed the potential of generative AI by playing around with ChatGPT and Google Bard, allowing us to envision this technology’s ability to enhance efficiencies. But it is reasonable to be skeptical of both the trillions of dollars in TAMs that the AI revolution will unleash or the emerging talk of an ‘AI bubble.’Story continuesNvidia is hardly alone in riding the AI wave, with Microsoft and Alphabet already duking it out for primacy. Alphabet’s earlier AI efforts didn’t impress the market much, and many had started thinking that Microsoft may be able to leverage AI to open up Alphabet’s hold on the search market. But Alphabet appears to have found its mojo back, as the stock’s recent performance shows.The earnings outlook for the ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ that includes Apple and Meta, in addition to Microsoft and Alphabet, has steadily improved lately. Total Q1 earnings for the group were essentially flat (down -0.4%) on +4.3% higher revenues.The growth outlook starts improving from the current period (2023 Q2) onwards, with earnings expected to be up +8.9% on +4.9% higher revenues.Q1 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 26th, we now have Q1 earnings from 486 S&amp;P 500 members, or 97.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.7% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 75.1% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63.2%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad, either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears warned us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 100 companies on deck to report results, including 9 S&amp;P 500 members.

33,9327c4ce-2040-4353-9c41-c5d549c857be,MSFT,2023-05-30,Nvidia debuts new AI supercomputers and services after shares skyrocket,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-new-ai-supercomputers-and-services-after-shares-skyrocket-141021034.html,1685369421,STORY,"['NVDA', 'META', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'MSFT']","[Nvidia (NVDA) took the wraps off a slew of new AI-centric products on Monday, as the chipmaker continues to ride the generative-AI wave.The lineup includes a high-powered supercomputer called the Nvidia DGX GH200 and a platform called Nvidia ACE that will put generative AI to work in video game development. Nvidia also said that advertising giant WPP will use its platforms and generative AI to build a content engine for producing ads.The announcements come after shares of the graphics chip giant skyrocketed last week on news that the company anticipated second-quarter revenue well above Wall Street’s expectations, based on the strength of its data center business.Nvidia stock was up more than 165% year-to-date as of Friday afternoon, with the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) just 9.5% higher in the same time frame. Rival chipmaker AMD (AMD) has seen a similar boost in stock price, rising 93%. But Intel (INTC) is lagging behind, with shares up just 8%.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on a recent earnings call that he believes data center operators are looking to inject AI computing prowess into their gear. That in turn is powering a shift to graphics chips like those his company makes, and away from the central processing units that underpinned Intel's previous dominance in data centers.According to Nvidia, its new DGX GH200 supercomputers combine 256 GH200 superchips that can act as a single graphics processing unit (GPU). The result is a system that has nearly 500 times the memory of a single one of Nvidia’s DGX A100 systems.“Generative AI, large language models and recommender systems are the digital engines of the modern economy,” Huang said in a statement.Nvidia's Grace Hopper platform pairs the company's CPU and GPU technology into one system. (Image: Nvidia) (Nvidia)“DGX GH200 AI supercomputers integrate NVIDIA’s most advanced accelerated computing and networking technologies to expand the frontier of AI.”The GH200 superchips that power the new supercomputer work by combining Nvidia’s Arm-based Grace GPU and an Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPU in a single package.Story continuesSo far Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud, Facebook parent Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the first companies that will get access to the supercomputers, Nvidia said. The chipmaker also said it's building its own supercomputer running four DGX 200 systems at the same time to power its own research.Nvidia is adding products against the backdrop of a massive increase in interest in generative AI that OpenAI kickstarted with the release of its ChatGPT bot last year. Since then, a wave of tech companies have released or said they're working on a generative-AI platform of their own.Microsoft and Google are leading the pack, thanks to Microsoft’s tie up with OpenAI, and Google’s years of AI research. Meanwhile, Facebook owner Meta is building out generative AI teams, and Apple (AAPL) is staffing up for its own efforts.Nvidia Omniverse and AIAlongside the hardware announcement Monday, Nvidia said it has partnered with advertising giant WPP to create a content engine that uses its Omniverse technology and generative AI capabilities to help build out ad content.The idea is to cut down on the time and price costs of producing ads by enabling WPP’s clients to lean on Nvidia’s technology.Speaking of the Omniverse, Nvidia said electronics manufacturers such as Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron are using Omniverse technology to create digital twins of their factory floors, so they can get a sense of how best to lay them out before making any physical changes.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)Nvidia also unveiled its ACE generative AI model for video games. The service will let game companies use generative AI for large games with multiple nonplayer characters, giving them unique lines of dialogue and ways to interact with players that would normally need to be programmed by developers individually.As interest in generative AI has climbed, so has Nvidia’s stock price. According to analysts, Nvidia is well ahead of its chip rivals in the AI processing space. But how long that remains the case is anyone’s guess.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Now a complaint is trying to stop U.S.-style union busting from taking over the world,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-employers-gone-opposing-international-104000451.html,1685356800,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Earlier this month, a group of U.S. unions–the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and Workers United–filed a complaint with the International Labour Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association. In the filing, they convincingly argue that U.S. labor law does not protect workers’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. These rights are enshrined in ILO Conventions 98 and 87 and are considered to be fundamental under the ILO’s Declaration of Fundamental Rights at Work.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home The submission provides detailed examples of union busting by U.S. companies such as Starbucks: threats, dismissals, and vitriolic rhetoric about the dangers of unionism, along with the company’s refusal to follow the orders of the National Labor Relations Board when it found that Starbucks is acting illegally.Starbucks keeps insisting it hasn't broken any laws, despite a mounting legal trail to the contrary. The NLRB under the Biden administration is eager to vigorously enforce the law on the books. But current laws simply allow so many loopholes, so much room for stalling, and give such a wide berth to “free speech” against unions that there is a limit on what the NLRB can do. The former CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz felt so comfortable in his anti-union position that he declared on national TV that he wants Starbucks to remain a union-free employer.As a former organizer and labor lawyer, I've long argued that U.S. law, as practiced, affords workers very little protection. In the 1980s, before the international standards had much relevance to global companies, lawyers representing U.S. companies argued that the U.S. should not ratify the International Labour Organization's conventions because to do so would prohibit U.S. employers from campaigning against unions. Though repugnant, this was at least an intellectually honest position, and, on that basis, the U.S. refused to ratify the conventions.Story continuesToday, employers have shifted their argument. They want not only to protect employer interference in the U.S. but also to normalize this as a global practice. Now, U.S. employers don’t hesitate to sign on to global principles such as those of the UN Global Compact, which obligate them to respect international rules. However, the employers argue that their union-busting practices are consistent with the ILO standards because “free speech” overrides “non -interference,” employees’ right to choose or not to have a union without pressure one way or the other from an employer.  By doing so, corporations claim to have an internationally sanctioned right to harangue their employees almost without limit–and even to lie to them about the “dangers” of unions.U.S. employers seem to think that non-interference means you can't shoot someone as in the days of old. Otherwise, almost everything is allowed or, at least tolerated. It is understood by trade unionists in the U.S. that employers will always interfere unless there is a private agreement to the contrary.What explains the shift? International standards are increasingly becoming part of the fabric of global governance. They might be embedded in trade agreements, procurement rules, or within the codes of conduct of investors. It's not acceptable anymore for a global company to tell its investors that they reject international labor standards. So instead of being honest, employers seek to distort the meaning of international labor standards beyond recognition.It's time for the ILO to make clear that U.S.-style interference with workers’ efforts to come together in a union violates the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association (convention 87). Such a finding might not deliver a change in U.S. law, but it would send a message to companies that they can't hide behind the United Nations and the ILO to justify their union-busting tactics.Christy Hoffman is general secretary of the UNI Global Union, the global union federation for the services industries which represents over 20 million workers in 150 countries.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:Stanford researchers scoured every reputable study for the link between video games and gun violence that politicians point to.

PM looks well-positioned due to the strength of its smoke-free products. Solid pricing power has also been working well for the company amid cost inflation and low cigarette volumes.These factors were witnessed in the first quarter of 2023, wherein management stated that it expects a top-and-bottom-line recovery in 2023, which is likely to be more weighted toward the second half. For 2023, Philip Morris expects net revenues to increase by nearly 7-8.5% on an organic basis.  For the full-year 2023, the company expects adjusted EPS in the band of $6.10-$6.22 compared with the $5.98 reported in 2022.Excluding currency movements, the adjusted EPS is envisioned in the band of $6.40-$6.52, suggesting 7-9% growth from the year-ago period figure. For the second quarter of 2023, the company expects organic top-line growth in the high single digits.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteKey UpsidesThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 34.9% of the company’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2023. PM is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.These next-generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research. Philip Morris expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options. In the first quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 14% (or up 2.6% on an organic basis) to $2,710 million. In the first quarter of 2023, net revenues from the Wellness and Healthcare segment rose 30.3% (or 37.9% on an organic basis) to $86 million.In the quarter, PM witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance, along with pricing power. Total IQOS users at the end of the first quarter were estimated at roughly 25.8 million (of which nearly 18.5 million had switched to IQOS and stopped smoking). For 2023, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units. Management expects net revenues of about $300 million for the Wellness and Healthcare segment for 2023.Moving on, Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the first quarter of 2023.  Pricing is likely to remain a driver in 2023, wherein pricing variance is expected to be 6-7%.Story continuesCost ConcernsPhilip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the first quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income tumbled 10.7% on an organic basis due to elevated marketing, administration and research costs, an adverse volume/mix and escalated manufacturing costs, partly compensated by favorable pricing variance.The adjusted operating margin contracted 5.8 points on an organic basis due to cost headwinds, including global inflationary pressures on the cost of sales (mainly hurting the combustible tobacco business), supply-chain hurdles associated with the transition to ILUMA, the overall inflation of operating costs and the phasing of various investments and other costs.Management expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. In 2023, the adjusted operating margin on an organic basis is likely to decline 50-150 basis points due to persistent global inflation, transitory effects related to the ILUMA roll-out and additional growth investments. Apart from these, Philip Morris expects increased net interest costs of around $200 million in 2023 compared with the 2022 levels.However, robust pricing actions and smoke-free portfolio strength are likely to keep working well for Philip Morris amid headwinds.Shares of PM have declined 6.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s drop of 7.5%.Solid Staple StocksSome better-ranked stocks are Lamb Weston LW, Conagra Brands CAG and General Mills GIS.Lamb Weston, which operates as a frozen potato product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(NYSE:GS) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, John Waldron, sold US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$387 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$332. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Goldman Sachs Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders dumped US$5.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Goldman Sachs Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$560m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Goldman Sachs Group Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Goldman Sachs in FocusBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -3.31%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $2.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.01% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.53% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.89%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Goldman's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, GS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $31.83 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.89%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest In.According to Fortune Business Insights, the autonomous cars market size is expected to increase from $1.63 billion in 2022 to $19.96 billion by 2029. This would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.97%. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the demand for self-driving cars, as reflected by the decline of 20.29% in the market size in 2020 in comparison to 2019. As the advancement of autonomous vehicles is dependent on a range of technologies, including automated driving systems, battery management systems and LiDAR, the interruption in the global supply chain networks and low availability of semiconductor chips restricted market expansion. In the aftermath of the pandemic, various governments and regulatory bodies implemented long-term strategies to reduce dependency on external sources for the raw materials required in the production of autonomous vehicles. For example, Europe introduced the European Chips Act, which was passed by the U.S. government in 2021 to enhance domestic chip production.The increasing adoption of self-driving cars is being driven by a number of trends. One such trend is the implementation of stringent emission regulations, which has forced automakers to focus on developing automated energy-efficient vehicles such as fuel-cell electric vehicles. Furthermore, autonomous driving also offers the potential to enhance mobility for elderly drivers by offering them alternative transportation options beyond public transport services. Autonomous driving technology can provide increased safety benefits as well. A study by ICDP has indicated that the widespread adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in Europe could lead to a potential reduction of approximately 15% in the number of accidents by 2030.According to McKinsey's 2021 survey, which gathered insights from over 25,000 consumers regarding their mobility preferences, approximately 25% of respondents expressed a strong inclination towards selecting an advanced autonomous driving feature when purchasing a new vehicle. Furthermore, around two-thirds of these respondents indicated their willingness to deposit a one-time fee of $10,000 or a corresponding subscription rate for an L4 highway pilot system. An L4 highway pilot offers hands-free driving capabilities on highways, subject to specific conditions. Keeping in view the rising demand for self-driving cars, the majority of prominent automakers are investing on a large scale in autonomous technology to facilitate its early adoption in their vehicles. Companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have also formed various strategic collaborations and partnerships. For instance, in April 2021, it was reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to collaborate with LG to produce its first autonomous vehicle model. Earlier, the tech giant was also rumored to be in talks with Hyundai and Kia regarding its electric car project, known as the ""Apple Car.” Furthermore, Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car company, also joined forces with Chinese automaker Geely to establish a fleet of all-electric, self-driving vehicles. These initiatives signify the collective efforts being made to bring autonomous vehicles to the forefront of transportation.Story continues14 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest InPhoto by Samuele Errico Piccarini on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo create our list of the best self-driving stocks, we initially compiled a comprehensive list of companies developing self-driving technology and operating in the autonomous vehicles sector.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the leading auto manufacturers globally.Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has a division, Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, dedicated specifically to the research of self-driving car technology. The division currently owns a fleet of approximately 90 Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans that are equipped with autonomous driving technology. In March, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also made an announcement regarding the establishment of a new wholly-owned subsidiary called Latitude AI. This subsidiary will be driving the company’s initiative to develop an advanced driving system that enables hands-free and unsupervised driving. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 10.98% as of May 26.12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based company specializing in artificial intelligence solutions and internet services.Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has established itself in the autonomous vehicles market through its autonomous ride-hailing business. The company plans to establish the largest fully driverless ride-hailing zone globally in 2023 by expanding its operations and introducing 200 driverless robotaxis into its fleet during this year.Here’s what Horos Asset Management said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).In the case of Baidu, as many will know, it is known as the “Chinese Google”. The company has been the leading Internet search engine in the Asian country for years, which has given it a historically privileged position to monetize, through online advertising, a huge user base. However, the rise of two types of applications has called into question the sustainability of its business model. On the one hand, mobile social apps, such as ByteDance’s well-known TikTok, have emerged as a new model of online consumption, generating a new platform through which to monetize Internet users. On the other hand, even more disruptive in the long term, is the emergence of the so-called super apps: a sort of virtual Swiss Army knives that allow users to access many products and services without having to leave their interface at any time, making Baidu’s traditional search engine less attractive. In this field, Tencent (with its super app Weixin/WeChat), Alibaba (Alipay) and Meituan certainly stand out. These two factors have caused Baidu’s online advertising market share to drop from 17% in 2017 to less than 7% estimated for 2022.34 To this deterioration, we should add the collapse in market value of its stake in iQiyi (video platform controlled by Baidu) and its equity holdings such as Trip.com (hotel and flight platform) …” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Impax Asset Management was the leading hedge fund investor in Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) during Q1 2023.Here’s what TimesSquare Capital Management said about Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV), a designer and manufacturer of vehicle components for original equipment manufacturers, rose 19%. Results from the latest quarter were above expectations and management maintained the outlook for revenue growth on bookings strength. Management acknowledged that 2023 could be difficult to forecast due to macroeconomic headwinds.”10. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 69QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is engaged in the production of wireless technologies for various sectors.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is gaining momentum globally in the field of autonomous driving through the company’s Snapdragon Ride Platform, which is facilitating innovation for top-tier automakers. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.90% as of May 26.Madison Investments shared its outlook on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a Michigan, United States-based automotive manufacturing company.In 2022, the CEO of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shared that the company aims to sell completely autonomous vehicles by 2025. In March this year, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) revealed its latest semi-autonomous driving technology with updates such as object avoidance and automatic lane change.On May 1, Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley upgraded General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from Equal Weight to Overweight and raised the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. The investment firm has named General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) amongst the “top 5” companies in the auto sector.8. Micron Technology, Inc.

The company’s memory and storage technology are helping power autonomous driving solutions.Of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was held by 74 hedge funds as of Q1 2023. Orbis Investment Management raised its stake in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) by 611% during the first quarter of the year.7. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 82Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a Texas, United States-based automotive company. The company has secured seventh place on our list of the best self-driving car stocks to invest in.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles are equipped with advanced hardware, which allows them to offer autopilot capabilities. CEO Elon Musk is betting on full-self driving and related advanced technology vehicles to drive Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) profits in the future and help the company compete against its rivals.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is engaged in the production of semiconductors and related technologies for various sectors.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best self-driving car stocks to invest in, as the company is heavily involved in the production of advanced sensors, domain controllers, and high-performance processors used in autonomous vehicles. As of Q1 2023, 91 hedge funds held a stake in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).Here’s what Falcon Capital Management said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”In addition to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

While the lowest estimate of $58 indicates a 7.3% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 53.5% to reach $83. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for AIG, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AIGAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 7.4% over the past month, as four estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, AIG currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AIG could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is American International Group (AIG). AIG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 7.68 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 8.27. Over the last 12 months, AIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.69 and as low as 7.26, with a median of 9.18.Another notable valuation metric for AIG is its P/B ratio of 0.85.

AIG's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.11. Within the past 52 weeks, AIG's P/B has been as high as 1.17 and as low as 0.68, with a median of 0.92.Finally, we should also recognize that AIG has a P/CF ratio of 3.73.

AIG's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 8.93. Within the past 12 months, AIG's P/CF has been as high as 3.87 and as low as 1.96, with a median of 2.60.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Insurance - Multi line value stock, take a look at Mnchener RckversicherungsGesellschaft (MURGY).

(HOLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-attracting-investor-130011775.html,1685365211,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.89 points to a change of -35.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.09 indicates a change of +5.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $956.48 million indicates a year-over-year change of -4.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.01 billion and $4.15 billion estimates indicate -17.6% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.5%. EPS of $1.06 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967.05 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.15%. The EPS surprise was +20.45%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TNDM is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of t:slim X2 based on Control-IQ technology and new product launches. In the first quarter, the top line met the high end of the company’s expectations.  However, escalating operating costs and stiff rivalry are concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 62.5% compared with the 3.1% fall of the industry and a 1.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $1.72 billion. Tandem Diabetes projects an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.9% for 2024 compared with 24.9% of the industry. In the trailing four quarters, TNDM has an average negative earnings surprise of 415.6%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsQ1 Upsides: Tandem Diabetes’ first-quarter revenues were in line with its expectations. The company continues to capture a competitive share in the insulin pump market on the strength of t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology. Within supplies, TNDM witnessed an increase in cartridges and infusion set sales, with its in-warranty installed base growing to approximately 300,000 people at the end of the first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe ongoing inventory transition to Tandem Diabetes’ European distribution center during the quarter witnessed a reduction in logistical supply chain challenges, strong international distributor relations and a closer correlation between pump shipments and pump placements on patients.t:slim’s Strong Prospects Continue: TNDM’s flagship product, t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology continues to make a positive clinical impact in terms of overall satisfaction and ease of use and reduces the burden of diabetes management. The company looks forward to making t:slim X2 the first FDA-cleared insulin pump integrated with multiple CGM sensors.TNDM is working closely with Dexcom to finalize Control-IQ integration with G7 and  coordinate its launch. The integration of Control-IQ technology with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 and Libre 3 sensors is also underway.Story continuesProduct Innovation to Contribute: We are encouraged to see Tandem Diabetes’ pipeline of new products and services for the diabetes community, set to launch in 2023. Following the FDA clearance, the company is preparing to expand the diabetes solutions portfolio through the launch of the Tandem Mobi system. The Mobi pump is about half the size of t:slim and can be operated by a smartphone through a mobile application.TNDM is also working on t:slim X3, which is a technology upgrade to t:slim X2.DownsidesMounting Expenses:  In the first quarter, Tandem Diabetes came out with lower-than-expected revenues and earnings. The company registered a wider adjusted operating loss compared to the prior-year quarter on a year-over-year increase of 22.6% in SG&amp;A expenses and 27.1% in R&amp;D expenses.Tough Competitive Pressure: Tandem Diabetes operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where Tandem Diabetes operates limit the company’s ability to switch to strategies like price increases.TNDM primarily competes with Medtronic’s market-leading MiniMed, a division of Medtronic. MiniMed boasts a major portion of the conventional insulin pump market share in the United States.Estimate TrendTandem Diabetes has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 loss per share has moved from 94 cents to $1.03 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $885.5 million.

In April, the streaming service announced the onboarding of content produced by Warner Bros, HBO, and Max Original.JioCinema is making it hard for Netflix and AmazonScoring international content will likely make the India journey of platforms like Netflix and Prime Video challenging.For starters, the service, unlike its global counterparts, offers some of the most affordable streaming service subscription plans in the country.

HIBB posted drab first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were hurt by inflation, job losses, higher interest rates and weak consumer confidence that affected purchasing behavior, particularly for discretionary products and services. On the flip side, its store growth plan and improved product assortment to meet consumer’s demand remained tailwinds. Consequently, management lowered its fiscal 2024 view.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 44.2% in the past three months compared with the industry's 18.2% decline.Quarterly HighlightsHibbett's adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share fell 5.2% from the $2.89 reported in the prior-year quarter.

Meanwhile, the gross margin contracted 330 basis points (bps) to 33.7%, driven by lower average product margin stemming from higher promotional activity across both footwear and apparel.Operating income was $45.9 million, down 9.5% year over year, whereas the operating margin contracted 190 bps to 10.1% for the reported quarter.Store operating, selling and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, contracted nearly 140 bps to 21.1%, driven by expense reduction initiatives, lower advertising spend and lower incentive compensation expense, somewhat offset by wage inflation.Story continuesOther FinancialsAs of Apr 29, Hibbett had $26.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and total stockholders' investment of $399 million.

Meanwhile, e-commerce is anticipated to decline in the low-single digit range, down from the prior view of a high-single-digit growth.The gross margin is envisioned to be 33.9-34%, down from the previously communicated view of 34.9-35% due to higher promotions and inflation on occupancy costs. The operating margin is predicted to be 7.4-7.8%, down from prior guidance of 9-9.3% due to lower margins and cost deleverage.SG&amp;A, as a percent of net sales, is estimated to be 23.3-23.5%, up from the last outlook of 23.2-23.3%. Also, interest expenses, as a percentage of net sales, are projected to be 0.4-0.45%, up from 0.25-0.3%.Earnings are anticipated to be $7-$7.75, down from the earlier guided view of $9.50-$10.00 per share.

Volume was off 11% year-over-year, led by a decline of 15% in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and India region.Operating cash was $531 million, down $1.1 billion year-over-year. Free cash flow conversion was 85% of net income on a trailing-12-month basis. The company noted it was focused on cost savings in the face of weak revenue and that this should help maintain margins throughout 2023.Future growth is likely in the coming years from stabilized pricing, which has improved in recent years, margin gains from cost savings, and the company’s share repurchase program. These factors combined should afford Dow the ability to produce some measure of earnings-per-share growth under normalized conditions.Story continuesThe company’s product portfolio is not only its competitive advantage but also should perform well enough during downturns to keep the company profitable. Its focused efforts on high-growth areas such as consumer care, packaging, and infrastructure, as well as its very long operating history as a component of the former company, and its brand, as competitive advantages.Dow’s payout ratio is currently at 88% of estimated earnings. This is relatively high, which could limit future dividend raises. Given the strong yield, management is focusing on boosting the buyback allocation. The stock yields 5.4%.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) on a gas station roof.Source: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is the fourth-largest oil major in the world based on its market cap of roughly $300 billion. Chevron is an integrated super-major, meaning it has large upstream and downstream businesses. Most of the company’s revenue is derived from its upstream exploration and production activities.In late April, Chevron reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Its production dipped 1% sequentially due to the end of a concession in Asia, which more than offset high production growth in the Permian. Refining margins remained near record levels thanks to the sanctions of western countries on Russia, but oil and gas prices somewhat moderated. As a result, EPS declined 13%, from $4.09 to $3.55.Chevron has announced a massive share repurchase program of $75 billion, enough to reduce the share count by 25%. Such a large buyback would provide a meaningful boost to EPS growth. Future earnings growth will also be driven organically by new oil and gas projects and production ramp-ups. Chevron is now in the positive phase of its investing cycle and is likely to return to growth mode this year thanks to its sustained growth in the Permian Basin and in Australia. The company has more than doubled the value of its assets in the Permian in the last four years thanks to new discoveries and technological advances.Thanks to the high grading of its asset portfolio, Chevron can fund its dividend even at an oil price of $40. With WTI prices at $70 per barrel, the company can generate plenty of cash flow to fund its growth and continue to raise the dividend. Chevron has raised its dividend by 6% in each of the last two years and is likely to keep raising its dividend in the upcoming years. The company has increased its dividend for over 35 years. The stock currently yields 3.9%.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is the largest independent biotech company in the world. Amgen discovers, develops, manufactures and sells medicines that treat serious illnesses. The company focuses on six therapeutic areas: cardiovascular disease, oncology, bone health, neuroscience, nephrology and inflammation. Amgen generates about $28 billion in annual revenues and operates in approximately 100 countries.In the most recent quarter, revenue declined 2.2% to $6.1 billion, which was $140 million less than expected. Adjusted EPS of $3.98 compared unfavorably to $4.25 in the prior year. However, this was in-line with estimates. Results were negatively impacted by lower revenues from Covid-19-related sales. Product revenue increased 2% while volumes were higher by 14%.Prolia, which treats osteoporosis and is now the company’s the top grossing product, grew 9% to $927 million, driven by an 8% increase in volume. Repatha, which is used to control cholesterol, increased 18% to a record $388 million. Amgen reduced prices for Repatha in 2018 and this has allowed the product to capture market share. Volumes were higher by 33% during the quarter, helping to offset lower selling prices. More than 1.7 million patients have received a prescription for Repatha.Amgen is in strong financial position. The company ended the quarter with $31.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Amgen provided updated guidance for 2023 as well. The company now expects adjusted earnings-per-share in a range of $17.60 to $18.70 for the year, up from $17.40 to $18.60. At the midpoint, this would be a 2.6% improvement from the prior year.Amgen has been a strong dividend growth stock. The company has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years. In 2022, the company hiked its dividend by 10%. The dividend is highly secure, as the company has a 2023 payout ratio expected at under 50%.And, the dividend can be maintained even in a recession. Amgen’s profitability holds up very well during economic downturns. Companies in the health care sector are often recession-resistant as people will seek treatment for their health issues regardless of economic conditions. The company also has a very low payout ratio that will allow it to continue to raise its dividend going forward, even in a prolonged recession. AMGN stock yields 3.8%.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Newmont The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.45bUS$1.68bUS$2.20bUS$2.98bUS$3.32bUS$3.56bUS$3.77bUS$3.95bUS$4.10bUS$4.24bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.43%Est @ 5.83%Est @ 4.72%Est @ 3.93%Est @ 3.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.1% US$1.3kUS$1.4kUS$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.1%– 2.1%) = US$62bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$62b÷ ( 1 + 9.1%)10= US$26bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$44b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$40.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Newmont as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.182. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NewmontStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Metals and Mining market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Newmont, there are three essential factors you should further research:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Newmont (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does NEM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Wynn Resorts is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.004 = US$49m ÷ (US$14b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Wynn Resorts has an ROCE of 0.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Hospitality industry average of 8.8%. View our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts roceIn the above chart we have measured Wynn Resorts' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Wynn Resorts here  for free.So How Is Wynn Resorts' ROCE Trending?In terms of Wynn Resorts' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 12%, but since then they've fallen to 0.4%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.In Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that Wynn Resorts is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has declined 40% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about Wynn Resorts, we've spotted   3 warning signs,  and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.While Wynn Resorts may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The edge in question is the mobile device that a user taps to access a network or service, and Katouzian used his time headlining one of the major keynote events at the Computex show in Taipei to make the case for how big a market that will be.The US company’s chips help smartphones harness AI for everything from processing photos to detecting malware. In emphasizing the “AI-capable” aspects of their products, Katouzian and his colleagues joined a flurry of companies positioning themselves as beneficiaries of a spike in demand for artificial intelligence. The company has shipped 2 billion AI-capable products to date, he said.“As growth in the number of connected devices and data traffic continues to accelerate and data center costs climb, it simply won’t be possible to send everything to the cloud,” Katouzian said. Nor will people want to do so when personal information is involved, he added.Rocketing demand for chips behind AI tools like Open AI’s ChatGPT is driving shares of chipmaking peer Nvidia Corp. to record highs. The wider enthusiasm for AI has prompted companies from semiconductor architect Arm Ltd. to Taiwan’s Asustek Computer Inc. to focus attention on their AI-related services, with more than one executive declaring a new computing era had dawned.In contrast to Nvidia, whose revenue outlook for the current quarter beat estimates by more than 50%, Qualcomm’s outlook fell well short of estimates on sluggish global demand for mobile devices. Katouzian sees the inventory glut depleting in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Some Qualcomm customers have begun increasing orders for smaller components, a leading indicator for an uptick in demand, he said.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA $1.5 Trillion Backstop for Homebuyers Props Up Banks InsteadHarvard MBA Grads Enter a Tepid Job Market Hoping for the BestHow Summer Camp Became Such a Hot Mess for ParentsCan Workplace Ketamine Retreats Improve Vibes in the Office?An App Aims to Stop Malaria-Carrying Mosquitoes From Reproducing©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest In.According to Fortune Business Insights, the autonomous cars market size is expected to increase from $1.63 billion in 2022 to $19.96 billion by 2029. This would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.97%. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the demand for self-driving cars, as reflected by the decline of 20.29% in the market size in 2020 in comparison to 2019. As the advancement of autonomous vehicles is dependent on a range of technologies, including automated driving systems, battery management systems and LiDAR, the interruption in the global supply chain networks and low availability of semiconductor chips restricted market expansion. In the aftermath of the pandemic, various governments and regulatory bodies implemented long-term strategies to reduce dependency on external sources for the raw materials required in the production of autonomous vehicles. For example, Europe introduced the European Chips Act, which was passed by the U.S. government in 2021 to enhance domestic chip production.The increasing adoption of self-driving cars is being driven by a number of trends. One such trend is the implementation of stringent emission regulations, which has forced automakers to focus on developing automated energy-efficient vehicles such as fuel-cell electric vehicles. Furthermore, autonomous driving also offers the potential to enhance mobility for elderly drivers by offering them alternative transportation options beyond public transport services. Autonomous driving technology can provide increased safety benefits as well. A study by ICDP has indicated that the widespread adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in Europe could lead to a potential reduction of approximately 15% in the number of accidents by 2030.According to McKinsey's 2021 survey, which gathered insights from over 25,000 consumers regarding their mobility preferences, approximately 25% of respondents expressed a strong inclination towards selecting an advanced autonomous driving feature when purchasing a new vehicle. Furthermore, around two-thirds of these respondents indicated their willingness to deposit a one-time fee of $10,000 or a corresponding subscription rate for an L4 highway pilot system. An L4 highway pilot offers hands-free driving capabilities on highways, subject to specific conditions. Keeping in view the rising demand for self-driving cars, the majority of prominent automakers are investing on a large scale in autonomous technology to facilitate its early adoption in their vehicles. Companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have also formed various strategic collaborations and partnerships. For instance, in April 2021, it was reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to collaborate with LG to produce its first autonomous vehicle model. Earlier, the tech giant was also rumored to be in talks with Hyundai and Kia regarding its electric car project, known as the ""Apple Car.” Furthermore, Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car company, also joined forces with Chinese automaker Geely to establish a fleet of all-electric, self-driving vehicles. These initiatives signify the collective efforts being made to bring autonomous vehicles to the forefront of transportation.Story continues14 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest InPhoto by Samuele Errico Piccarini on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo create our list of the best self-driving stocks, we initially compiled a comprehensive list of companies developing self-driving technology and operating in the autonomous vehicles sector.

(NASDAQ:LYFT) is a California, United-States-based ride-hailing company.Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) plans to introduce a substantial fleet of driverless cars this year. To achieve this goal, the company has collaborated with self-driving car developer Motional to enhance its existing robotaxi service in Las Vegas. As of 2023, Lyft, Inc.

The division currently owns a fleet of approximately 90 Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans that are equipped with autonomous driving technology. In March, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also made an announcement regarding the establishment of a new wholly-owned subsidiary called Latitude AI. This subsidiary will be driving the company’s initiative to develop an advanced driving system that enables hands-free and unsupervised driving. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 10.98% as of May 26.12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based company specializing in artificial intelligence solutions and internet services.Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has established itself in the autonomous vehicles market through its autonomous ride-hailing business. The company plans to establish the largest fully driverless ride-hailing zone globally in 2023 by expanding its operations and introducing 200 driverless robotaxis into its fleet during this year.Here’s what Horos Asset Management said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).In the case of Baidu, as many will know, it is known as the “Chinese Google”. The company has been the leading Internet search engine in the Asian country for years, which has given it a historically privileged position to monetize, through online advertising, a huge user base. However, the rise of two types of applications has called into question the sustainability of its business model. On the one hand, mobile social apps, such as ByteDance’s well-known TikTok, have emerged as a new model of online consumption, generating a new platform through which to monetize Internet users. On the other hand, even more disruptive in the long term, is the emergence of the so-called super apps: a sort of virtual Swiss Army knives that allow users to access many products and services without having to leave their interface at any time, making Baidu’s traditional search engine less attractive. In this field, Tencent (with its super app Weixin/WeChat), Alibaba (Alipay) and Meituan certainly stand out. These two factors have caused Baidu’s online advertising market share to drop from 17% in 2017 to less than 7% estimated for 2022.34 To this deterioration, we should add the collapse in market value of its stake in iQiyi (video platform controlled by Baidu) and its equity holdings such as Trip.com (hotel and flight platform) …” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Results from the latest quarter were above expectations and management maintained the outlook for revenue growth on bookings strength.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.90% as of May 26.Madison Investments shared its outlook on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a Michigan, United States-based automotive manufacturing company.In 2022, the CEO of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shared that the company aims to sell completely autonomous vehicles by 2025.

The company’s memory and storage technology are helping power autonomous driving solutions.Of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was held by 74 hedge funds as of Q1 2023. Orbis Investment Management raised its stake in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) by 611% during the first quarter of the year.7. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 82Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a Texas, United States-based automotive company. The company has secured seventh place on our list of the best self-driving car stocks to invest in.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles are equipped with advanced hardware, which allows them to offer autopilot capabilities. CEO Elon Musk is betting on full-self driving and related advanced technology vehicles to drive Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) profits in the future and help the company compete against its rivals.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is engaged in the production of semiconductors and related technologies for various sectors.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”In addition to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also some of the best self-driving stocks to invest in.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for QUALCOMM, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$13b ÷ (US$48b - US$7.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, QUALCOMM has an ROCE of 31%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for QUALCOMM compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEYou'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at QUALCOMM. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 226%. The company is now earning US$0.3 per dollar of capital employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 21% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. QUALCOMM may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn a nutshell, we're pleased to see that QUALCOMM has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.If you'd like to know about the risks facing QUALCOMM, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: InMode INMD, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and GE HealthCare GEHC.Solid Earnings Fuel Potential Bull Market in Medical DevicesThe medical device sector is experiencing a notable surge in value, according to financial expert Jim Cramer of CNBC. Cramer highlighted the positive earnings reports of various medical device companies, indicating a growing bullish trend. This article examines the factors contributing to this market's growth and identifies key companies that have demonstrated promising performance.A Potential Bull MarketCramer emphasized the emergence of a bullish market in medical devices, noting the consistently positive earnings results shared by multiple companies in the industry. He expressed his hope for a debt ceiling-related sell-off, which would temporarily lower market prices and present investors with an opportunity to purchase medical device stocks at discounted prices.Non-Urgent Surgeries ReboundIn the wake of the pandemic, hospitals faced overwhelming challenges, leading to the deferral of non-essential surgeries. As the crisis subsided, the resumption of these non-urgent procedures fueled an increase in the sale of medical devices. This rebound has contributed to solid earnings and overall growth of the industry.Here we discuss four Medical Device companies — InMode, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical and GE HealthCare — that have strong potential to gain going forward on the back of a recovery in demand for surgeries.InMode Capitalizes on Minimally-Invasive Radio Frequency DevicesCramer highlighted InMode as one of the companies benefiting from market growth. InMode is renowned for its development of minimally-invasive radio frequency devices primarily used in cosmetic surgery. The company's recent earnings report indicated a 43% rise in consumables and service revenues. Though INMD’s stock declined following the report, Cramer attributed this to conservative projections by the company's executives and considered it an opportunity to purchase InMode stock at an undervalued price, which is down 9.6% so far this year.Story continuesInMode Ltd. price | InMode Ltd. QuoteJohnson &amp; Johnson Sees Success of Medical Devices DivisionCramer pointed out Johnson &amp; Johnson as another potential beneficiary of the bullish market. In April, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, partially driven by the success of its medical devices division. Cramer noted that while JNJ is currently dealing with legal challenges related to its talc products and their potential link to ovarian cancer, the primary concern lies in litigation risks rather than earnings. J&amp;J is down 12.6% so far this year.Johnson &amp; Johnson price | Johnson &amp; Johnson QuoteIntuitive Surgical Records Impressive Growth in Robotic SurgeryIntuitive Surgical, the manufacturer of the robotic Da Vinci Surgical System, delivered a remarkable quarter, surpassing expectations. Although the number of robotic surgery systems sold by ISRG remained consistent with the previous year, there was a significant 26% increase in the number of procedures performed worldwide. Cramer highlighted the company's strong performance, with Intuitive Surgical's stock experiencing a 14.4% increase year to date.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteGE HealthCare Diagnostic Equipment Division in FocusCramer also mentioned GE HealthCare as a company of interest. GE HealthCare's exceptional diagnostic equipment division, which includes a range of scanners crucial for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease, is likely to be the key factor driving GEHC’s performance going forward. Cramer predicted an increasing demand for these machines as the FDA approves more Alzheimer's drugs, underscoring the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of new medications. GE HealthCare has gained 32% so far this year.GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. price | GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. QuoteConclusionThe medical device industry is currently witnessing the start of a bullish market, backed by positive earnings reports from various companies. Factors such as the rebound of non-urgent surgeries and advancements in medical technology contribute to the sector's growth. Investors are keeping a close eye on companies like InMode, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, and GE HealthCare, which have demonstrated a strong performance and hold potential for future success.While InMode carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the remaining three companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

69,70c02bdd-e5c0-3e7f-b025-46a1c39ccd4e,JNJ,2023-05-30,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-johnson-johnson-130011435.html,1685365211,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -5.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has lost 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 indicates a change of +3.2% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.64 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $98.83 billion and $101.04 billion estimates indicate +4.1% and +2.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

China began developing the airliner in 2007, pouring at least $70 billion-plus in state funds into the program. But the plane has been plagued by delays due to design flaws and problems sourcing parts from US suppliers.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesWhether the narrow-body C919 can compete with the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft will depend on how quickly Comac can ramp up production and convince airlines to buy its jet. According to People’s Daily (link in Chinese), which cited a report by Shanghai’s science and technology commission, Comac had signed contracts for orders of 1,035 C919 jets with several dozen customers by the end of last year.For comparison, Airbus has over 13,000 aircraft in operation worldwide as of the end of April. Boeing similarly has over 10,000 commercial airplanes in operation globally. The foreign technology powering China’s C919Global Times, a state-backed outlet hailed the C919's inaugural commercial flight as “important proof of China’s strength in self-innovation in the high-end manufacturing industry.”But is it? In fact, core components and systems critical to the C919's functioning are heavily reliant on foreign technology. The C919's engine, for example, comes from CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace of the US and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.Meanwhile, the C919's tires are sourced from Michelin, the French tire giant. Tire pressure monitoring systems are supplied by the US-headquartered Crane Aerospace and Electronics.Story continuesVarious aircraft systems—including in-flight entertainment, integrated communication, navigation, surveillance, and cabin core systems—come from Collins Aerospace, in the US. Honeywell, another American industrial giant, supplies wheels and brakes, as well as flight control electronics, for the C919.In a way, these concessions are a result of the Boeing-Airbus dominance, the very duopoly the C919 wants to break. “Yes, it is made of many American and European parts because, uh, commercial aircraft is a duopoly,” Damien Ma of Macro Polo China, a think tank, wrote on Twitter. “Why is this a surprise that China doesn’t and probably will never have a fully indigenized supply chain?”Still, developing the C919 has also helped develop a domestic ecosystem of suppliers. notesAccording to the Shanghai Securities Journal (link in Chinese), the state-owned AVIC Aircraft supplies structural components like wing boxes and flaps; Sichuan Chengfei Integration Technology provides parts and component; and advanced materials manufacturer Western Superconducting Technologies supplies titanium alloys.“The C919 maiden flight is bringing along with it many industry chain companies,” the newspaper noted.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

80,5287b63a-e5b8-39ba-a61b-09cdebc2a97d,CI,2023-05-30,Cigna (CI) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-ci-top-dividend-stock-154510084.html,1685375110,STORY,['CI'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Cigna in FocusHeadquartered in Bloomfield, Cigna (CI) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -26.33% so far this year. The health insurer is paying out a dividend of $1.23 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.02% compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.32% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.92 is up 9.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, Cigna has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 306.36%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Cigna's payout ratio is 22%, which means it paid out 22% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for CI for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $24.79 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.53%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, CI is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Finding some gems out there is certainly possible, but I won’t be beating down the bushes looking for opportunities in the banking sector.These days there’s more to dislike about bank stocks than there is to appreciate them. Regional bank stocks are depressed because of the Silicon Valley Bank failure. That exposed some other weaknesses in the sector and made regional bank stocks a losing bet.But there are other reasons to give bank stocks the side eye right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBanks are heavily reliant on the economy. They need people to have confidence in the economy and be willing to spend and borrow.Yes, credit card debt continues to rise, and the American consumer is resilient. You also can’t ignore the debt ceiling debate in Washington and be concerned about how the U.S. defaulting on its obligations would be disastrous.Besides what it would do to the stock market, such a downturn would surely hurt credit quality and trigger more defaults. That would hurt bank stocks and their bottom lines.These days, bank stocks are also under fire from fintech. Banks must rapidly adjust in the next few years before they become another Blockbuster.Even Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that more bank mergers may be needed. That’s not helping bank stocks, either.I’m casting some serious doubt on a handful of bank stocks.Bank of America (BAC)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comI currently own Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), but I’m thinking twice these days about BAC stock. And I certainly wouldn’t recommend opening a new position in this megabank soon.Bank of America is one of the biggest banks in the U.S., so it’s closely watched as as bellwether of the banking sector. And it’s telling that BAC stock is down 15% this year, reaching levels not seen since 2020.It’s reasonable to expect the Federal Reserve to closely monitor banks now that we’ve seen some failures. Bank of America could be subjected to additional stress tests and regulations that could weigh down shares.Story continuesBank of America has a dividend yield of 3.1%, but even that’s not tempting under these conditions. BAC stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Valley National Bancorp (VLY)Golden light shining from crack of door on black safe with black background, representing bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/marozhka studioNew Jersey-based Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) is one of those regional banks that investors are a little more skeptical about lately. Valley National operates on the East Coast, in the New York region. It specializes in working with midsized landlords in the New York City area.According to S&amp;P Global, Valley National is the biggest bank in the U.S., with a ratio of commercial real estate loans to capital exceeding the regulators’ recommendations.That’s a red flag considering the troubles that caused other banks to fail this year. It’s no wonder that VLY stock is down more than 30%.Earnings for the first quarter missed analysts’ expectations for revenue and EPS. The bank reported $490.32 million and EPS of 30 cents versus expectations of $523.66 million and EPS of 33 cents.VLY stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Zions Bancorporation (ZION)Illustration of the inside of a bank.

Its deposits fell by 16% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis.And with 52% of uninsured deposits, it’s in the Top 20 of banks with uninsured deposits as a percentage of total deposits.ZION stock is down 41% this year and has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.PacWest Bancorp (PACW)Pacific Western Bank headquarters in Beverly Hills, CA, USA. Pacific Western Bank is an American commercial bank owned by PacWest Bancorp (PACW).Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIf you overlay the stock chart of Zion and PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), they look almost identical, but the dip is more extreme. PacWest, a regional bank based in Los Angeles, has many of the same issues as Zion and other regional banks.I’d have to be slightly more cautious of PacWest than Zion because of its location. California regional banks seem to have more exposure to the Silicon Valley breed of tech stocks that helped trigger this whole mess.PACW stock sold off hard after it disclosed that it lost nearly 10% of its deposits in just a week. PacWest stock is down nearly 70% just this year – even after the stock jumped 10% on some welcome news that PacWest was able to sell off some real estate loans and reduce its exposure.Some investors may be willing to give PACW a chance and try to do some bottom-feeding, but not me. PACW stock still has a well-deserved “F” in the Portfolio Grader.Western Alliance (WAL)In this photo illustration Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comWestern Alliance (NYSE:WAL) is a regional bank company in the southwest, with headquarters in Phoenix and locations in Arizona, Nevada and California.Unfortunately for investors, Western Alliance hasn’t been immune to the hazards of being a regional bank. Shares traded for more than $80 earlier this year. But after a 38% drop in 2023, WAL stock is now less than $40.But there’s at least some good news with WAL stock. Western Alliance announced that its deposits increased by $2 million this year, rising from roughly $47.6 million on March 31 to $50 million as of May 12. The report indicates that Western Alliance may be able to start recovering from the Silicon Valley Bank debacle as customers feel more confident in depositing their money.If you love bank stocks, I give you credit for looking for a silver lining, but this is still one of those bank stocks I’m not going to touch.

The bank has assets of about $91.13 billion, up slightly from a year ago.But like many other regional banks, Comerica is being tarnished by the same brush. It was among nearly a dozen regional banks that got a downgrade from Moody’s.And like other names on this list, CMA stock is down big this year, falling more than 40%.Comerica did manage to beat analysts’ expectations on both earnings and revenue in the first quarter. It posted revenue of $990 million and EPS of $2.39, while the experts expected revenue of $965.34 million and EPS of $2.27.CMA stock will be hard-pressed to repeat that performance.

(TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist Financial Corp. (NYSE:TFC) is another of the larger regional bank stocks. The company is a merger of BB&amp;T and SunTrust Banks, which combined in 2019.From its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist has customers from Georgia to New Jersey and as far west as Tennessee.And while the bank has a relatively low ratio of loans to deposits, which indicates it’s healthier than others on this list, TFC stock has the same challenges. This year, the stock is down 30%, falling big in early March as the Silicon Valley shock reverberated through the sector.Is it possible for Truist and some of the other names on this list to bounce back? Of course. But why would you bet on that? There are too many headwinds to chase some profits in the banking sector today.

Last year in December, the drugmaker met its main goal in a late-stage study for a hemophilia B gene therapy.The current trial of marstacimab only tested patients who did not have any antibodies that stop the production of the blood-clotting proteins called factor VIII or factor IX.Pfizer is also testing marstacimab in patients with those inhibitors, with data expected in late 2024.(Reporting by Vaibhav Sadhamta and Aditya Samal in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that the pivotal Phase 3 BASIS clinical trial (NCT03938792) evaluating marstacimab has met its primary endpoints, having demonstrated statically significant and clinically meaningful effects. Marstacimab, a novel, investigational anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI) being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A or B for people without inhibitors to Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX), was administered weekly with flat (not weight-based) dosing in the trial as a subcutaneous 300 mg loading dose followed by 150 mg once weekly.""Despite significant treatment advances in recent years, many people living with hemophilia unfortunately continue to experience bleeding episodes and are required to manage their disease with frequent intravenous infusions,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""These results support the potential for marstacimab to become the first once-weekly non-factor treatment for people with hemophilia B and a treatment option that helps address the diverse needs of patients with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors. These needs include preventing excessive or potentially life-threatening bleeds, while at the same time reducing the burden of treatment with once-weekly, subcutaneous administration.""Story continuesThe BASIS trial demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with marstacimab resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in people living with severe hemophilia A and moderately severe to severe hemophilia B without inhibitors. 116 people living with hemophilia were treated with marstacimab during a 12-month period versus a prophylaxis and on-demand intravenous regimen with FVIII or FIX, administered as part of usual care in the six-month lead-in period. In the cohort of patients treated with on-demand factor replacement intravenous therapy in the lead-in period, marstacimab demonstrated superiority (P&lt; 0.0001) with a 92% reduction in bleeds. The results also showed superiority (p=0.0376) with marstacimab compared to prophylaxis, with a 35% reduction in ABR.The safety profile for marstacimab was consistent with Phase 1/2 results and treatment was generally well-tolerated. No deaths were reported and there have been no thromboembolic events or events of consumptive coagulopathy recorded in hemophilia patients that have been enrolled in clinical trials investigating marstacimab.Discovered by Pfizer scientists, marstacimab has a mechanism of action that is differentiated from FVIII and FIX replacement treatments that are the current treatment standard for hemophilia. Instead of replacing missing or insufficient clotting factors, marstacimab targets TFPI, one of the body’s natural mechanisms that inhibits the initiation of blood clotting. By targeting the Kunitz-2 domain of TFPI, marstacimab may help re-establish balance between bleeding and blood clot formation.Marstacimab is in development as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B, in each case with or without inhibitors. The inhibitor cohort of the BASIS trial is completing enrollment and is expected to read out as early as late 2024.""These encouraging results from the BASIS trial demonstrate marstacimab’s potential as a promising subcutaneous treatment option that could offer improvement over the current standard of care for many living with hemophilia,"" said Davide Matino, M.D., M.Sc., Assistant Professor of Medicine, McMaster University. ""If approved, marstacimab may both prevent bleeds and reduce the treatment burden that many people living with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors face today.""Analyses of the full Phase 3 dataset are ongoing, and results will be presented at an upcoming scientific conference. Pfizer will discuss these data with regulatory authorities, with the goal of initiating regulatory filings in the coming months.Pfizer currently has three Phase 3 programs investigating novel treatment options for people living with hemophilia. In addition to the BASIS study, fidanacogene elaparvovec and giroctocogene fitelparvovec are investigational gene therapy treatments being studied for the treatment of adults living with hemophilia B and hemophilia A, respectively.About the BASIS studyBASIS is a global Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study evaluating annualized bleed rate through 12 months on treatment with marstacimab, an investigational, novel subcutaneous therapy option, in approximately 145 adolescent and adult participants between ages 12 to &lt;75 years with severe hemophilia A (defined as FVIII &lt;1%) or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B (defined as FIX activity &lt;=2%), with or without inhibitors. Approximately 20% of participants are adolescents (ages between 12 to &lt;18 years old). This study is comparing treatment with a run-in period for patients’ prescribed factor replacement therapy or bypass therapy during a 6-month Observational Phase with a 12-month Active Treatment Phase, during which participants receive prophylaxis (a 300 mg subcutaneous loading dose of marstacimab, followed by 150 mg subcutaneously once weekly) with potential for dose escalation to 300 mg once weekly.Pfizer is also conducting BASIS KIDS, an open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of marstacimab in children &lt;18 years of age with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B with or without inhibitors. The study will compare 12 months of historical standard treatment to marstacimab prophylaxis.About Marstacimab (PF-06741086)Marstacimab (PF-06741086) is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G isotype, subclass 1 (IgG1) that targets the Kunitz 2 domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a natural anticoagulation protein that functions to prevent the formation of blood clots. Marstacimab is in development as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B with or without inhibitors.In September 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to marstacimab for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A with inhibitors or hemophilia B with inhibitors.About HemophiliaHemophilia is a family of rare genetic blood diseases caused by a clotting factor deficiency (FVIII in hemophilia A, FIX in hemophilia B) which prevents normal blood clotting. Hemophilia is diagnosed in early childhood and impacts more than 400,000 people worldwide.1 The inability of the blood to clot properly can increase the risk of painful bleeding inside the joints, which can cause joint scarring and damage. People living with hemophilia can suffer permanent joint damage following repeated bleeding episodes.1,2For decades, the most common treatment approach for hemophilia A and B has been factor replacement therapy, which replaces the missing clotting factors. Factor replacement therapies increase the amount of clotting factor in the body to levels that improve clotting, resulting in less bleeding.2,3 Approximately 25-30% of people with hemophilia A and 3-5% of people with hemophilia B are unable to continue taking factor replacement therapies because they develop inhibitors to FVIII and FIX.4,5About Pfizer: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

If approved, it will provide an approval pathway for an updated vaccine for the upcoming 2023 fall vaccination season.The CHMP recommendation is based on data from the phase III PREVENT-19 study, phase II study, and real-world evidence which have exhibited the efficacy and safety of Nuvaxovid as both a primary series and booster dose.In the year so far, shares of Novavax have plunged 29.9% compared with the industry’s 9.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company markets different versions of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine — one under the trade name Covovax (in partnership with the Serum Institute of India) and another under Nuvaxovid.We note that Nuvaxovid has not yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. In July 2022, NVAX secured emergency use authorization (EUA) from the agency for the administration of its COVID vaccine in adults.Additionally, the vaccine is authorized as a booster dose for individuals aged 18 and older. In the United States, it is marketed as Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted.Story continuesThere are other mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in the market that are developed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA. These companies did not have a strong product launch but established a strong hold on the market.By the time Novavax was granted authorization for its vaccine, most of the population had already completed primary vaccination using Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s approved mRNA-based vaccines. The mRNA-based jabs were also the first ones authorized by the FDA in 2020.The vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are the only ones that have received full approval for use in adults in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is permitted for individuals aged 12 years and above.Both these vaccines are also authorized for administration in individuals aged six months and over in the United States. Novavax’s vaccine is currently authorized as a primary regimen in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have also secured EUA from the FDA for using their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines as a single booster dose. The bivalent vaccines of these companies are authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above.Novavax is also making significant advancements in the development of its alternative vaccine candidates, including standalone influenza vaccines, COVID-19-influenza combination vaccines and high-dose COVID jabs.These candidates are presently being evaluated in phase II clinical study involving older adults in the age group of 50-80 years.The company has initiated a cost-reduction plan in May 2023 to control its cash burn, extending the existing cash runway to support its operations beyond February 2024.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 5.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 indicates a change of +4.9% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.3%. The $61.88 billion and $64.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.2% and +3.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.4%. EPS of $1.36 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.15%. The EPS surprise was +7.09%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.General Motors Company and Tesla are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that GM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TSLA has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.98, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 54. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.51. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.19.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.63. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 12.54.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GM's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.Story continuesGM stands above TSLA thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that GM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest In.According to Fortune Business Insights, the autonomous cars market size is expected to increase from $1.63 billion in 2022 to $19.96 billion by 2029. This would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.97%. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the demand for self-driving cars, as reflected by the decline of 20.29% in the market size in 2020 in comparison to 2019. As the advancement of autonomous vehicles is dependent on a range of technologies, including automated driving systems, battery management systems and LiDAR, the interruption in the global supply chain networks and low availability of semiconductor chips restricted market expansion. In the aftermath of the pandemic, various governments and regulatory bodies implemented long-term strategies to reduce dependency on external sources for the raw materials required in the production of autonomous vehicles. For example, Europe introduced the European Chips Act, which was passed by the U.S. government in 2021 to enhance domestic chip production.The increasing adoption of self-driving cars is being driven by a number of trends. One such trend is the implementation of stringent emission regulations, which has forced automakers to focus on developing automated energy-efficient vehicles such as fuel-cell electric vehicles. Furthermore, autonomous driving also offers the potential to enhance mobility for elderly drivers by offering them alternative transportation options beyond public transport services. Autonomous driving technology can provide increased safety benefits as well. A study by ICDP has indicated that the widespread adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in Europe could lead to a potential reduction of approximately 15% in the number of accidents by 2030.According to McKinsey's 2021 survey, which gathered insights from over 25,000 consumers regarding their mobility preferences, approximately 25% of respondents expressed a strong inclination towards selecting an advanced autonomous driving feature when purchasing a new vehicle. Furthermore, around two-thirds of these respondents indicated their willingness to deposit a one-time fee of $10,000 or a corresponding subscription rate for an L4 highway pilot system. An L4 highway pilot offers hands-free driving capabilities on highways, subject to specific conditions. Keeping in view the rising demand for self-driving cars, the majority of prominent automakers are investing on a large scale in autonomous technology to facilitate its early adoption in their vehicles. Companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have also formed various strategic collaborations and partnerships. For instance, in April 2021, it was reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to collaborate with LG to produce its first autonomous vehicle model. Earlier, the tech giant was also rumored to be in talks with Hyundai and Kia regarding its electric car project, known as the ""Apple Car.” Furthermore, Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car company, also joined forces with Chinese automaker Geely to establish a fleet of all-electric, self-driving vehicles. These initiatives signify the collective efforts being made to bring autonomous vehicles to the forefront of transportation.Story continues14 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest InPhoto by Samuele Errico Piccarini on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo create our list of the best self-driving stocks, we initially compiled a comprehensive list of companies developing self-driving technology and operating in the autonomous vehicles sector.

The division currently owns a fleet of approximately 90 Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans that are equipped with autonomous driving technology. In March, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also made an announcement regarding the establishment of a new wholly-owned subsidiary called Latitude AI. This subsidiary will be driving the company’s initiative to develop an advanced driving system that enables hands-free and unsupervised driving.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based company specializing in artificial intelligence solutions and internet services.Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has established itself in the autonomous vehicles market through its autonomous ride-hailing business. The company plans to establish the largest fully driverless ride-hailing zone globally in 2023 by expanding its operations and introducing 200 driverless robotaxis into its fleet during this year.Here’s what Horos Asset Management said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).In the case of Baidu, as many will know, it is known as the “Chinese Google”. The company has been the leading Internet search engine in the Asian country for years, which has given it a historically privileged position to monetize, through online advertising, a huge user base. However, the rise of two types of applications has called into question the sustainability of its business model. On the one hand, mobile social apps, such as ByteDance’s well-known TikTok, have emerged as a new model of online consumption, generating a new platform through which to monetize Internet users. On the other hand, even more disruptive in the long term, is the emergence of the so-called super apps: a sort of virtual Swiss Army knives that allow users to access many products and services without having to leave their interface at any time, making Baidu’s traditional search engine less attractive. In this field, Tencent (with its super app Weixin/WeChat), Alibaba (Alipay) and Meituan certainly stand out. These two factors have caused Baidu’s online advertising market share to drop from 17% in 2017 to less than 7% estimated for 2022.34 To this deterioration, we should add the collapse in market value of its stake in iQiyi (video platform controlled by Baidu) and its equity holdings such as Trip.com (hotel and flight platform) …” (Click here to read the full text)11.

Here’s what the firm said:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”9.

Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG, The Kraft Heinz Co. KHC, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW and McCormick &amp; Company, Inc. MKC.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Grocery Stocks to Buy on Jump in April Online SalesHigh commodity prices and higher borrowing costs have compelled people to cut down on spending. This has been severely impacting the manufacturing sector, which has been shrinking as demand is drying up. Also, the retail sector has been suffering as consumers are spending cautiously.However, it is almost impossible to cut down on spending on basic necessities like daily-need items and groceries. This has seen online grocery sales grow steadily amid inflationary pressures. Groceries belong to the consumer staples sector, and investing in such stocks is safe during this time of economic uncertainty.Online Grocery Sales GrowAccording to the latest Brick Meets Click/Mercatus Shopping Survey, online grocery sales increased 1% year over year in April. Online grocery sales totaled $8.2 billion. The jump comes despite a decline in pickup and ship-to-home sales.Pickup declined 3%, while ship-to-home sales dropped 19%. However, delivery sales soared 20% in April.The gains in delivery sales in April were driven by a solid jump in monthly active users and higher average order value (AOV).This means an increasing number of people are opting to buy groceries online. At the same time, demand is still high, which is boosting orders.  AOV rose 5% year over year in April.Another reason for the jump in April is a low unemployment rate and steady growth in wages. Higher wages are helping consumers with more purchasing power. Also, solid job additions to the economy in April helped boost grocery sales. The U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs in April.Story continuesInflation, although at a multi-year high, showed signs of easing in April. The consumer price index (CPI) showed that consumer prices rose 4.9% year over year in April compared to 5% in March. This is the lowest annual rate since April 2021.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in grocery stocks with a strong online presence. Also, groceries belong to the consumer staples sector, which is defensive in nature. These stocks are fundamentally sound given that consumer demand for staples like groceries typically remains resilient to wild swings in the economic cycle.Our PicksGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in these four food and grocery stocks.

102,8640a332-ef3e-308e-9c45-06dff6bd9e77,TGT,2023-05-30,LGBTQ+ activists call for new strategies to promote equality after Target backlash,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lgbtq-activists-call-strategies-promote-041355227.html,1685420035,STORY,"['TGT', 'BUD']","[RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Following Target’s announcement last week that it removed products and relocated Pride displays to the back of certain stores in the South, activists in the LGBTQ+ community are calling for new campaigns to convince corporate leaders not to cave to anti-LGBTQ+ groups.“We need a strategy on how to deal with corporations that are experiencing enormous pressure to throw LGBTQ people under the bus,” said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, a member of the LGBTQ legislative caucus.“We need to send a clear message to corporate America that if you’re our ally — if you are truly our ally — you need to be our ally, not just when it’s easy but also when it’s hard,” he said.While the retailer said its actions were aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of its employees after protesters knocked over Pride signs and confronted workers in stores, the controversy comes at a time when conflict over LGBTQ+ rights is simmering.Nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures around the country this year. At least 18 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors.The hostile environment has prompted some groups to hire security consultants to advise them on activities planned for Pride Month, which begins on Thursday.“We are forced to think differently about how we handle security at our events and whether or not we can post our staff’s names and emails on our website,” said Janson Wu, executive director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, a nonprofit legal rights organization based in Boston.Debra Porta, executive director of Pride Northwest, in Portland, Oregon, said there have been discussions about a possible boycott, a letter-writing campaign and other actions directed at Target, but plans for an organized protest haven't yet materialized.“Because the news is fairly new, more actions may be announced, especially as Pride Month gets here,” said Porta.Story continuesTarget isn't the only company grappling with public criticism.Bud Light is still dealing with fallout from its partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who in April posted a picture on Instagram of a beer can with her face on it. In response to the hate-filled and transphobic backlash that followed, the company said it “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,"" but didn't directly address the rhetoric or signal clear support for Mulvaney. Bud Light’s parent company, Anheuser-Busch, is tripling its U.S. marketing spending this summer as it tries to restore lost sales.In early May, several gay bars in Chicago stopped selling Anheuser-Busch products to protest the company’s response.Chicago's 2Bears Tavern said the company's response “shows how little Anheuser-Busch cares about the LGBTQIA+ community, and in particular transgender people, who have been under unrelenting attack in this country.”“Since Anheuser-Busch does not support us, we will not support it,” said the company.Sidetrack, the largest gay bar in the Midwest, did the same, saying Anheuser-Busch “wrongfully validates the position that it is acceptable to acquiesce to the demands of those who do not support the trans community and wish to erase LGBTQ+ visibility.”In Florida, Disney has been engaged in a legal battle with Gov. Ron DeSantis since the company expressed its opposition to the state’s classroom limits on discussing gender identity and sexual orientation.And the Los Angeles Dodgers announced last week that a satirical LGBTQ+ group called the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence will again be welcome at the team’s annual Pride Night — nearly a week after the team rescinded its original invitation, citing backlash from conservative Roman Catholics and politicians who accused the group of mocking the Christian faith.“Now’s not the time to back down,” said Brian K. Bond, executive director of PFLAG, an organization founded in 1973 to advocate for LGBTQ+ people and their families.“I think both business and us as citizens need to look within ourselves into new strategies. The old models aren’t necessarily working,” he said.Some people remain concerned about the impact of Target’s Pride displays on children, said Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation of Virginia, a conservative, faith-based organization in Richmond.“Target is paying the price for telling kids to be discontent with their bodies, putting ideology ahead of the interests of investors, and creating a hostile store environment for parents with children,” Cobb said in a statement.In a Richmond Target store on Sunday, Pride merchandise was prominently displayed at the front of the store.Brenda Alston, a 75-year-old retiree, said she bought a pair of rainbow sandals to show support for the LGBTQ+ community and for Target.“If you come in the store and this is not what you support, keep on walking and get what you need in another part of the store,” Alston said. “Who are you to tell me what to buy and what Target should offer their customers?”Still, some see the hostility toward Target and other retailers as just the latest obstacle in a decades-long struggle for equality.“To me, this is a sign that we’re winning,” said Derek Mize, a gay attorney who lives in an Atlanta suburb with his husband and two children.“I think that these people moaning about our visibility are the last breaths of a dying prejudice,” he said. “Society is changing, and most people are not concerned about Target selling an LGBTQ shirt.”___Selsky reported from Salem, Oregon.]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intuitive Surgical's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.4% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Intuitive Surgical's moderate 9.8% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 9.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Intuitive Surgical's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: InMode INMD, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and GE HealthCare GEHC.Solid Earnings Fuel Potential Bull Market in Medical DevicesThe medical device sector is experiencing a notable surge in value, according to financial expert Jim Cramer of CNBC. Cramer highlighted the positive earnings reports of various medical device companies, indicating a growing bullish trend. This article examines the factors contributing to this market's growth and identifies key companies that have demonstrated promising performance.A Potential Bull MarketCramer emphasized the emergence of a bullish market in medical devices, noting the consistently positive earnings results shared by multiple companies in the industry. He expressed his hope for a debt ceiling-related sell-off, which would temporarily lower market prices and present investors with an opportunity to purchase medical device stocks at discounted prices.Non-Urgent Surgeries ReboundIn the wake of the pandemic, hospitals faced overwhelming challenges, leading to the deferral of non-essential surgeries. As the crisis subsided, the resumption of these non-urgent procedures fueled an increase in the sale of medical devices. This rebound has contributed to solid earnings and overall growth of the industry.Here we discuss four Medical Device companies — InMode, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical and GE HealthCare — that have strong potential to gain going forward on the back of a recovery in demand for surgeries.InMode Capitalizes on Minimally-Invasive Radio Frequency DevicesCramer highlighted InMode as one of the companies benefiting from market growth. InMode is renowned for its development of minimally-invasive radio frequency devices primarily used in cosmetic surgery. The company's recent earnings report indicated a 43% rise in consumables and service revenues. Though INMD’s stock declined following the report, Cramer attributed this to conservative projections by the company's executives and considered it an opportunity to purchase InMode stock at an undervalued price, which is down 9.6% so far this year.Story continuesInMode Ltd. price | InMode Ltd. QuoteJohnson &amp; Johnson Sees Success of Medical Devices DivisionCramer pointed out Johnson &amp; Johnson as another potential beneficiary of the bullish market. In April, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, partially driven by the success of its medical devices division. Cramer noted that while JNJ is currently dealing with legal challenges related to its talc products and their potential link to ovarian cancer, the primary concern lies in litigation risks rather than earnings. J&amp;J is down 12.6% so far this year.Johnson &amp; Johnson price | Johnson &amp; Johnson QuoteIntuitive Surgical Records Impressive Growth in Robotic SurgeryIntuitive Surgical, the manufacturer of the robotic Da Vinci Surgical System, delivered a remarkable quarter, surpassing expectations. Although the number of robotic surgery systems sold by ISRG remained consistent with the previous year, there was a significant 26% increase in the number of procedures performed worldwide. Cramer highlighted the company's strong performance, with Intuitive Surgical's stock experiencing a 14.4% increase year to date.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteGE HealthCare Diagnostic Equipment Division in FocusCramer also mentioned GE HealthCare as a company of interest. GE HealthCare's exceptional diagnostic equipment division, which includes a range of scanners crucial for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease, is likely to be the key factor driving GEHC’s performance going forward. Cramer predicted an increasing demand for these machines as the FDA approves more Alzheimer's drugs, underscoring the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of new medications. GE HealthCare has gained 32% so far this year.GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. price | GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. QuoteConclusionThe medical device industry is currently witnessing the start of a bullish market, backed by positive earnings reports from various companies. Factors such as the rebound of non-urgent surgeries and advancements in medical technology contribute to the sector's growth. Investors are keeping a close eye on companies like InMode, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, and GE HealthCare, which have demonstrated a strong performance and hold potential for future success.While InMode carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the remaining three companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

105,22d7a8da-c0da-333d-ac14-784ba0d5004d,CSX,2023-05-30,Here's Why We Think CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-csx-nasdaq-110014373.html,1685444414,STORY,['CSX'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for CSX How Quickly Is CSX Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, CSX has grown EPS by 15% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. CSX maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$15b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of CSX's forecast profits?Are CSX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of CSX, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$173m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to CSX, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.CSX's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$9.4m in the year leading up to December 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Should You Add CSX To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, CSX is a growing business, which is encouraging. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for CSX, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for CSX that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ROST)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-ross-stores-161455496.html,1685376895,STORY,['ROST'],"[Let's talk about the popular Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$113 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$101. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ross Stores' current trading price of US$103 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ross Stores’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Ross Stores What Is Ross Stores Worth?According to my valuation model, Ross Stores seems to be fairly priced at around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ross Stores today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $119.78, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Ross Stores’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What kind of growth will Ross Stores generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ross Stores' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ROST’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ROST, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Ross Stores as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

121,153aec18-4b26-3211-8fd9-40d3bb3e0e83,GPC,2023-05-30,2 Auto Replacement Parts Stocks Making Strides Against Odds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-115600860.html,1685361360,STORY,"['LKQ', 'GPC']","[The transition toward electric and self-driving vehicles has necessitated a strategic realignment of business models for participants in the Zacks Automotive Replacement Parts industry. To capitalize on evolving market dynamics, companies must formulate a comprehensive roadmap that maximizes the available opportunities. Balancing high operational costs is crucial, prompting industry players to focus on the cost-effective development of parts and components to maintain their market share.High raw material expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange translations and logistical hurdles are adversely impacting profit margins. However, amidst these challenges, the increasing longevity of vehicles offers a glimmer of hope. In this challenging landscape, Genuine Parts Company GPC and LKQ Corporation LKQ stand out favorably due to their strategic acquisitions and investor-friendly initiatives.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. Some important auto replacement components are engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts. The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Key Themes at PlayAging Cars Creating Opportunities: A recent S&amp;P Global Mobility report reveals that a combination of limited supply and escalating prices is causing a decline in Americans' interest in purchasing new cars. The average age of vehicles in the United States has reached 12.5 years, indicating an increase of three months compared to the previous year and reaching an all-time high. This prolonged lifespan of vehicles is playing a significant role in driving demand for auto replacement and repair companies. To ensure the continued functionality of their aging vehicles, customers are choosing to invest in replacing faulty parts and components. As a result, there has been a noticeable surge in demand for auto replacement parts. Additionally, due to concerns about an economic slowdown, customers are anticipated to prefer repairing their older vehicles instead of spending excessive amounts on new, high-priced vehicles.Story continuesMounting Costs of Technological Advancements: The surging popularity of electric vehicles has compelled the industry to invest heavily in the development of technologically advanced auto components. However, these high technology costs are posing a significant challenge to the margins of auto replacement parts. As the industry strives to keep up with the evolving trends and demands of the automotive market, companies are required to continuously develop and upgrade their offerings. This necessitates substantial capital expenditure and research and development expenses. Consequently, the burden of these costs is likely to exert pressure on operating margins and cash flows within the industry.Commodity Pressures &amp; Forex Woes Squeeze Margins: The auto replacement parts industry is facing significant challenges as high raw material prices, particularly steel and non-ferrous metals, are putting a strain on gross margins. The inflation of commodities adds further hurdles and is expected to persist for a considerable period, hindering profitability. Moreover, the global presence of most industry players makes them susceptible to foreign exchange difficulties. Unfavorable currency translations are likely to impact earnings and margins negatively. Furthermore, the industry is grappling with logistical obstacles and disruptions in the supply chain systems, which further cloud the industry's outlook and prospects.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #184, which places it in the bottom 27% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 3% south.Despite the industry’s muted near-term outlook, we will present two stocks worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector but Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has declined 3.4%, narrower than the sector’s loss of 25%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has risen 1.7% over the same timeframe. One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 8.15X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.74X and the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 11.72X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.08X, as low as 6.76X and at a median of 9.44X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)2 Stocks Worth ConsideringGenuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. The acquisitions of PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group and the possession of full ownership in Inenco have bolstered the company’s growth. The KDG acquisition has strengthened Genuine Parts’ market-leading position on the North American industrial platform. The company's dividend aristocrat status boosts investors’ confidence. Genuine Parts approved a $3.88 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing its 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 5.8% and 4.2%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 8.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Genuine Parts — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A — topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 8.2%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price &amp; Consensus: GPCLKQ: Headquartered in Illinois, LKQ is one of the leading providers of replacement parts, components and systems. The buyouts of Elite Electronics, Green Bean Battery, SeaWide Marine Distribution, Greenlight and Fabtech Industries have bolstered the firm’s product offerings and sales. LKQ’s focus on cost discipline and simplification of its operating model are likely to result in sustained margin expansion. Low leverage and high liquidity are other positives that aid margins. LKQ has investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. We like the company’s commitment to increasing shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 5.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 6% and 8%, respectively. LKQ— currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A — topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other, with the average surprise being 2.5%.Price &amp; Consensus: LKQWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

123,04448afb-b1c0-3a24-bfb2-35597833e8c1,CMI,2023-05-30,Cummins' (CMI) Spinoff Atmus Makes Impressive Trading Debut,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-cmi-spinoff-atmus-makes-111100693.html,1685358660,STORY,"['CMI', 'F', 'ALSN']","[Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc., a spinoff of Cummins CMI, made its trading debut on May 26 at the New York Stock Exchange after successfully raising $275 million in an initial public offering (IPO). Carrying the ticker ATMU, Atmus’ shares witnessed a substantial 11% increase on the first day of trading, providing investors with a promising start and suggesting a bright future for the company as it embarks on its independent journey in the market.This article explores the positive market response to Atmus and delves into the company's product offerings, financial performance and position within the industry.Market Debut and PerformanceAtmus' IPO was priced in the middle of the marketed range, demonstrating confidence from investors. Initially sold at $19.50 per share, shares of Atmus opened at $21.67 on May 26, closing the day at $21.65. This performance resulted in a market value of $1.8 billion for the Nashville-based company.The successful listing ranks as the seventh-largest IPO on a U.S. exchange this year, contributing to an increasingly favorable market environment following a sluggish first quarter, the slowest since 2016, per data compiled by Bloomberg. The listing of Atmus follows the recent successful trading debut of Kenvue Inc., a spinoff of Johnson &amp; Johnson's consumer health products division. Kenvue's $4.37 billion IPO, the only offering to surpass $1 billion this year in the United States, further reinforces the improving market sentiment.Product Portfolio and Global ReachAtmus specializes in Fleetguard products, encompassing fuel, air, hydraulic and other filters for a diverse range of applications such as commercial vehicles, agriculture, construction, mining and power-generation equipment. With its presence in 150 countries, the company derived 51% of its net sales from the United States and Canada in 2022. This global reach positions Atmus to capitalize on the increasing demand for filtration solutions across various industries.Story continuesKey StatsUnder the umbrella of Cummins, Atmus has demonstrated consistent growth in net sales over the past three years. From $1.23 billion in 2020, the company's net sales rose to $1.56 billion in 2022. Moreover, Atmus achieved $170 million in net income for 2022, representing a 19% increase from 2020. While the net income decreased slightly from the previous year, the company has managed to navigate challenging market conditions rather well.Cummins' Continued Control and Key StakeholdersCummins — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) — remains the majority owner of Atmus, owning 83% of the company's shares. This ensures that Cummins retains control over Atmus, safeguarding its strategic interests and facilitating future growth opportunities. The IPO involved a debt-for-equity exchange between Atmus and leading financial institutions Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., highlighting the confidence of these key stakeholders in the company's potential.ConclusionThe impressive market debut of Atmus Filtration Technologies following its successful IPO reflects investor optimism and growing market sentiment. With a diverse product portfolio and a global presence, Atmus is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for filtration solutions. The company's consistent financial performance and Cummins' majority ownership further contribute to its growth prospects. As the market continues to recover and expand, Atmus appears poised to carve out a prominent position within the industry and deliver value to its shareholders.Key Picks From Auto SpaceGeneral Motors GM: One of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022. General Motors’ compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bode well.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders, since the share price is down 26% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 40%. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 14% in a month. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.After losing 3.8% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Walt Disney's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 5.4% each year. The share price decline of 9% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Walt Disney has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Walt Disney will grow revenue in the future.A Different PerspectiveWalt Disney shareholders are down 19% for the year, but the market itself is up 1.0%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.8% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

(NYSE:JNPR), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$34.43 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$28.43. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Juniper Networks' current trading price of US$30.50 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Juniper Networks’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Is Juniper Networks Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 19.58x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 22.84x, which means if you buy Juniper Networks today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Juniper Networks should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Furthermore, it seems like Juniper Networks’s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Juniper Networks?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 14% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Juniper Networks. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? JNPR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at JNPR? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on JNPR, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for JNPR, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Juniper Networks at this point in time.

However, the surge in demand from China has yet to materialize.OPEC announced an unexpected production cut on April 2. These developments took analysts by surprise. Could China’s demand be weaker? Or was oil suffering due to expectations of a recession in the second half? With this uncertainty, energy sector stocks have sold off year-to-date.However, the sell-off presents an opportunity for patient investors. Notably, entering 2023, oil stocks had the best fundamentals in the market. Indeed, they had strong earnings growth and cheap free cash flow multiples compared to other sectors.Now, after the sell-off, there are many undervalued oil stocks. Although earnings might decline slightly from historic 2022 levels, fundamentals are solid.Yes, a recession might hurt oil demand in the medium term. But hydrocarbons will continue powering economic activity as demand surges. So, consider these undervalued oil stocks for your portfolio.OXYOccidental Petroleum$58.84CVXChevron$154.87DVNDevon Energy $48.39Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Undervalued Oil StocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAfter the almost calamitous Anadarko acquisition in 2019, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has pulled itself from the brink of bankruptcy.Story continuesThe deal saddled Occidental with over $40 billion in debt. And just as the company was planning on asset sales and operating efficiencies to pay down debt, Covid-19 struck.Over the last two years, the company has had a remarkable resurgence. The Russian-Ukraine war and the ensuing oil spike have accelerated the return to financial stability. So far, the company has focused on aggressively paying down debt. In fiscal year (FY) 2022, the company repaid $10.5 billion in debt.According to the latest earnings report, the company has begun redeeming preferred stock.Due to its cost-cutting efforts, the company is massively profitable at current oil prices. Cash flow in the latest quarter hit $2.9 billion, and net income was $983 million. And it is using excess cash to buy back stock.In the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2023, they bought back $752 million of common stock.Now that debt is manageable and rapidly declining, the firm has pivoted to shareholder returns. Thus, analysts expect this undervalued oil stock to do well. Analysts have an average price target of $68.Besides, the stock is a bargain at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 10. The Oracle of Omaha also likes OXY stock. He holds over 24% of the shares outstanding. And he continues to buy more.On May 18, Reuters reported that Buffet added $201 million worth of shares.Chevron (CVX)Undervalued Oil StocksSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comRecently, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might have caught your attention after the huge political uproar from its massive buyback announcement.The company announced a $75 billion buyback after a record $36.5 billion profit in 2022. Politicians were unimpressed, claiming big oil companies were fueling inflation bythe move.Shareholders will benefit from the buyback since it will be accretive to earnings. Besides the buyback, you get to enjoy solid dividends. The company has a solid track record of dividend payments. It is a dividend champion, having raised its dividend for 35 years.Thus, if you are looking for solid oil stocks, Chevron is an option. It’s an integrated supermajor with one of the healthiest balance sheets and competent management. Its diversified portfolio includes oil and gas production, refining and petrochemicals.The diversified portfolio enhances the stability of Chevron’s earnings. Second, its global refining business benefits when crude prices are weak. Third, the company’s petrochemical joint venture with Phillips 66 provides further diversification.Management has maintained a strong balance sheet through previous oil cycles. Then, when opportunities arise, they utilize their balance sheet to make value-adding acquisitions. For instance, the Noble acquisition in 2020 and the recently announced acquisition of PDC Energy.In terms of financial performance, the stock has been a solid performer, with record cashflows and earnings in 2022. After a 16% pullback, CVX stock is undervalued at a forward P/E of 10.5. Meanwhile, you pocket a healthy 3.89% dividend yield as you await appreciation.Devon Energy (DVN)Undervalued Oil StocksSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOil stocks underperformed the S&amp;P 500 index between 2015 and 2020. Investors were unimpressed by the lack of capital discipline amid falling oil prices.But oil companies have rationalized capital expenditure. Instead, they are focusing on returns to shareholders. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) pioneered pivoting to a capital discipline and return to shareholder model.It offers a fixed plus variable dividend. Thus, as free cash flow rises, the variable component increases. Because of this change, Devon has had one of the highest dividend yields in the industry. When it delivers a great quarter, shareholders benefit as they receive a higher yield.Management has been committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Year to date, they have already returned over $1 billion, as highlighted in the first quarter earnings release. Underlining this commitment, the board increased the buyback by 50% to $3 billion.After earnings, investors seemed disappointed despite the stellar results – including an all-time production record of 320,000 barrels per day. The stock sold offplummeting from October 2022 levels of around $75.This energy stock is one of the best undervalued oil stocks.According to TipRanks analysts, the stock is cheap. The average price target is $66 representing over 30% upside.Based on earnings, DVN stock trades at a forward P/E of 7. It has a modest debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6. So, management will allocate a significant portion of free cash flow to buybacks and dividends.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With high-interest rates, economic slowdown, and weakness across multiple sectors, oil prices have taken a hit. They have seen massive volatility over the past few months. With the onset of summer, I believe oil prices could be ready for steady growth and this means top oil stocks could see a sector reversal. Furthermore, as we inch closer to the end of rate hikes, we could see a slowdown in the economic growth and this means a rise in oil prices. Smart investors know now is a good time to start looking for oil stocks to buy.The Saudi energy minister has already warned of further OPEC+ output cuts and this means there could be a supply squeeze, further pushing oil prices higher. The peak travel season is upon us and oil prices could start to rise. Therefore, now is a good time to cash in on the “black gold” and start investing in oil stocks that are well-positioned in the industry today. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the three oil stocks to buy for a sector reversal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a solid, well-established powerhouse in the oil and gas sector. The company is engaged in the production, exploration, refining as well as distribution of oil and gas. Having built a solid foundation over the years, the company holds an enviable position in the market today. If you are looking for a dividend stock in this industry, CVX is one of those oil stocks to buy. The company has been raising dividends for 35 consecutive years. One solid reason to bet on this business is its solid profile. The company has low operating costs and is generating a whopping amount in cash. It ended 2022, with $18 billion in cash and needs only $5 billion to operate. The company generated a cash flow from operations of $7.2 billion in the first quarter. CVX stock offers passive income thru dividends, a balanced profile, and strong financials. It produced a net income of $6.57 billion in the recent quarter, which is up from $6.26 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Story continuesThe stock has been suffering after Warren Buffet trimmed his investment in the company. However, I think a lot is working in favor of CVX stock. Recently, the company announced the acquisition of PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PDCE) in an all-stock deal valued at $6.3 billion. Chevron believes that this transaction will add $1 billion to its annual free cash flow. Morgan Stanley has raised the price target of the stock to $198, which is a massive upside potential from the current level. Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another one of the oil stocks for sector reversal that has impressed investors with a strong first quarter. The company reported a record-breaking first-quarter net income of $11.4 billion and I believe its business will hold steady in the coming quarters. It posted an EPS of $2.79 which is up from $1.28 in the same period last year. This is more than a 100% jump and it is nothing but impressive. Clearly, Exxon Mobil has had a better first quarter in 2023 than it did in 2022 and I think the momentum will continue. XOM is one of the top oil sector reversal stocks to own today. It has increased dividends for 20 consecutive years and has a dividend yield of 3.42% with a recent dividend payout of $0.91. Conservative investors love XOM stock. It is trading at $106 today and is inching closer to the 52-week high of $119. The stock is up 12% in the past year and hasn’t dropped below $60 since November 2021. The company has a solid business and a long way to go. If you are trying to add an oil stock to your portfolio, this is the one to buy. The business is globally diversified which makes it an attractive investment in uncertain times. However, it is still affected by the industry’s cyclical movements but not as much as other businesses. The company has also joined the electric vehicle bandwagon and bought drilling rights on 120,000 acres in Arkansas for lithium production. This means it is also preparing for a future that is less reliant on gasoline. Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOne of the best oil stocks to buy is Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Based in Oklahoma City, the company has a hydrocarbon exploration business which has a strong dividend yield. It remains one of the top dividend stocks to buy now. The company is a leader in its niche and has steadily paid dividends for the past 17 years. It has a dividend yield of 9.18%, better than the majority of dividend-paying companies in the industry. It recently paid a quarterly dividend of $1.13. Devon has a fixed and variable dividend program wherein one portion remains fixed and the variable portion varies according to the profits generated by the company. If you look at the earnings potential of this stock, it looks undervalued at $49. DVN stock is down 30% in the year and 15% year to date. This is due to the drop in oil prices. However, it is also an opportunity for investors to grab the stock at discounted rates. When it comes to financials, Devon Energy has a robust balance sheet and it has had a record year for the business. The company saw the top and bottom lines racing ahead this quarter. It also reached an all-time high in oil production at 320,000 barrels per day. With a rise in profits, the company continues to increase dividend payouts. With the rise in oil prices, Devon Energy is set to soar higher. Buy the stock while it is trading at a discount. On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest In.According to Fortune Business Insights, the autonomous cars market size is expected to increase from $1.63 billion in 2022 to $19.96 billion by 2029. This would reflect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.97%. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the demand for self-driving cars, as reflected by the decline of 20.29% in the market size in 2020 in comparison to 2019. As the advancement of autonomous vehicles is dependent on a range of technologies, including automated driving systems, battery management systems and LiDAR, the interruption in the global supply chain networks and low availability of semiconductor chips restricted market expansion. In the aftermath of the pandemic, various governments and regulatory bodies implemented long-term strategies to reduce dependency on external sources for the raw materials required in the production of autonomous vehicles. For example, Europe introduced the European Chips Act, which was passed by the U.S. government in 2021 to enhance domestic chip production.The increasing adoption of self-driving cars is being driven by a number of trends. One such trend is the implementation of stringent emission regulations, which has forced automakers to focus on developing automated energy-efficient vehicles such as fuel-cell electric vehicles. Furthermore, autonomous driving also offers the potential to enhance mobility for elderly drivers by offering them alternative transportation options beyond public transport services. Autonomous driving technology can provide increased safety benefits as well. A study by ICDP has indicated that the widespread adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in Europe could lead to a potential reduction of approximately 15% in the number of accidents by 2030.According to McKinsey's 2021 survey, which gathered insights from over 25,000 consumers regarding their mobility preferences, approximately 25% of respondents expressed a strong inclination towards selecting an advanced autonomous driving feature when purchasing a new vehicle. Furthermore, around two-thirds of these respondents indicated their willingness to deposit a one-time fee of $10,000 or a corresponding subscription rate for an L4 highway pilot system. An L4 highway pilot offers hands-free driving capabilities on highways, subject to specific conditions. Keeping in view the rising demand for self-driving cars, the majority of prominent automakers are investing on a large scale in autonomous technology to facilitate its early adoption in their vehicles. Companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have also formed various strategic collaborations and partnerships. For instance, in April 2021, it was reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to collaborate with LG to produce its first autonomous vehicle model. Earlier, the tech giant was also rumored to be in talks with Hyundai and Kia regarding its electric car project, known as the ""Apple Car.” Furthermore, Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car company, also joined forces with Chinese automaker Geely to establish a fleet of all-electric, self-driving vehicles. These initiatives signify the collective efforts being made to bring autonomous vehicles to the forefront of transportation.Story continues14 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest InPhoto by Samuele Errico Piccarini on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo create our list of the best self-driving stocks, we initially compiled a comprehensive list of companies developing self-driving technology and operating in the autonomous vehicles sector. Then, we used Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 to select the stocks with the highest number of hedge funds investors. The stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund ownership.Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Invest In14. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a California, United-States-based ride-hailing company.Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) plans to introduce a substantial fleet of driverless cars this year. To achieve this goal, the company has collaborated with self-driving car developer Motional to enhance its existing robotaxi service in Las Vegas. As of 2023, Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) has already provided over 100,000 self-driving rides to customers. Click here to read the company’s earnings call transcript for Q1 2023.13. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the leading auto manufacturers globally.Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has a division, Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, dedicated specifically to the research of self-driving car technology. The division currently owns a fleet of approximately 90 Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans that are equipped with autonomous driving technology. In March, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also made an announcement regarding the establishment of a new wholly-owned subsidiary called Latitude AI. This subsidiary will be driving the company’s initiative to develop an advanced driving system that enables hands-free and unsupervised driving. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 10.98% as of May 26.12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Beijing, China-based company specializing in artificial intelligence solutions and internet services.Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has established itself in the autonomous vehicles market through its autonomous ride-hailing business. The company plans to establish the largest fully driverless ride-hailing zone globally in 2023 by expanding its operations and introducing 200 driverless robotaxis into its fleet during this year.Here’s what Horos Asset Management said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).In the case of Baidu, as many will know, it is known as the “Chinese Google”. The company has been the leading Internet search engine in the Asian country for years, which has given it a historically privileged position to monetize, through online advertising, a huge user base. However, the rise of two types of applications has called into question the sustainability of its business model. On the one hand, mobile social apps, such as ByteDance’s well-known TikTok, have emerged as a new model of online consumption, generating a new platform through which to monetize Internet users. On the other hand, even more disruptive in the long term, is the emergence of the so-called super apps: a sort of virtual Swiss Army knives that allow users to access many products and services without having to leave their interface at any time, making Baidu’s traditional search engine less attractive. In this field, Tencent (with its super app Weixin/WeChat), Alibaba (Alipay) and Meituan certainly stand out. These two factors have caused Baidu’s online advertising market share to drop from 17% in 2017 to less than 7% estimated for 2022.34 To this deterioration, we should add the collapse in market value of its stake in iQiyi (video platform controlled by Baidu) and its equity holdings such as Trip.com (hotel and flight platform) …” (Click here to read the full text)11. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is a Dublin-Ireland-based automotive technology company.In 2021, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) revealed its advanced technology platform for automated driving.

Results from the latest quarter were above expectations and management maintained the outlook for revenue growth on bookings strength. Management acknowledged that 2023 could be difficult to forecast due to macroeconomic headwinds.”10. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 69QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is engaged in the production of wireless technologies for various sectors.QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is gaining momentum globally in the field of autonomous driving through the company’s Snapdragon Ride Platform, which is facilitating innovation for top-tier automakers. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.90% as of May 26.Madison Investments shared its outlook on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a Michigan, United States-based automotive manufacturing company.In 2022, the CEO of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shared that the company aims to sell completely autonomous vehicles by 2025. In March this year, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) revealed its latest semi-autonomous driving technology with updates such as object avoidance and automatic lane change.On May 1, Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley upgraded General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from Equal Weight to Overweight and raised the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. The investment firm has named General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) amongst the “top 5” companies in the auto sector.8. Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU) was held by 74 hedge funds as of Q1 2023. Orbis Investment Management raised its stake in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) by 611% during the first quarter of the year.7. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)No of Hedge Fund Holders: 82Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a Texas, United States-based automotive company. The company has secured seventh place on our list of the best self-driving car stocks to invest in.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles are equipped with advanced hardware, which allows them to offer autopilot capabilities. CEO Elon Musk is betting on full-self driving and related advanced technology vehicles to drive Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) profits in the future and help the company compete against its rivals.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is engaged in the production of semiconductors and related technologies for various sectors.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”In addition to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also some of the best self-driving stocks to invest in.

This industry suffered major jolts during the coronavirus outbreak due to lockdowns and other restrictive norms to maintain social distancing. As we are out of pandemic-era restrictions, restaurant businesses are thriving in 2023.Strong Restaurant Sales in AprilAlthough the retail sector has been taking a beating over the past year, sales at U.S. restaurants have not been impacted much despite inflationary pressure. The Department of Commerce reported that sales at U.S. bars and restaurants increased 0.6% in April. This came despite inflationary pressure. Food prices have been soaring but consumer spending has been steady, boosting sales of restaurants.The restaurants’ space is the main driver of growth for overall retail sales. Steady consumer spending continued in April despite worries that the economy will enter a recession this year. Although higher interest rates have made customers concerned, they are nonetheless spending lavishly at restaurants and bars.Importantly, after the removal of pandemic-era restrictions, on-premises dining is gaining popularity. The industry body, the National Restaurant Association (NRA) stated “Despite the booming popularity of off-premises restaurant meals and snacks in recent years, pent-up demand for in-restaurant experiences — socialization, celebration, and culinary exploration — is strong, with 70% of respondents noting customer desire to gather on-premises.”The NRA in its latest report said that the restaurant industry is poised to grow at a fast pace in 2023.

The dividend yield will be 4.5% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The company is paying out a large amount of its cash flows, even though it isn't generating any profit. This makes us feel that the dividend will be hard to maintain.Earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, we would start to get a bit worried, with the payout ratio possibly reaching 98%.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.28 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Seagate Technology Holdings hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Seagate Technology Holdings' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

(NYSE:UPS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-united-parcel-110034020.html,1685444434,STORY,['UPS'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, United Parcel Service fair value estimate is US$147With US$172 share price, United Parcel Service appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for UPS is US$190, which is 29% above our fair value estimateHow far off is United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.40bUS$8.60bUS$8.65bUS$9.41bUS$9.08bUS$8.93bUS$8.89bUS$8.91bUS$8.98bUS$9.09bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x12Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -1.66%Est @ -0.53%Est @ 0.26%Est @ 0.82%Est @ 1.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$6.8kUS$7.3kUS$6.8kUS$6.9kUS$6.1kUS$5.6kUS$5.1kUS$4.7kUS$4.4kUS$4.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$58bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$152bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$152b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$69bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$127b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$172, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.031. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Parcel ServiceStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For United Parcel Service, there are three pertinent elements you should assess:Risks: Be aware that  United Parcel Service is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Future Earnings: How does UPS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

It has amassed assets over $734.77 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.55%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.53%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector--about 31.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Staples round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) accounts for about 3.72% of total assets, followed by Abbvie Inc (ABBV) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO).The top 10 holdings account for about 34.69% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskPWV seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Large Cap Value Intellidex Index before fees and expenses. The Dynamic Large Cap Value Intellidex Index is designed to provide capital appreciation while maintaining consistent stylistically accurate exposure.The ETF has lost about -5.51% so far this year and is down about -6.35% in the last one year (as of 05/30/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $41.65 and $49.21.The ETF has a beta of 0.88 and standard deviation of 16.60% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 51 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesInvesco Dynamic Large Cap Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, PWV is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $48.59 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $98.85 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.NiSource and MGE are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that NI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MGEE has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.16, while MGEE has a forward P/E of 21.58. We also note that NI has a PEG ratio of 2.49. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MGEE currently has a PEG ratio of 4.03.Another notable valuation metric for NI is its P/B ratio of 1.72. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MGEE has a P/B of 2.39.Based on these metrics and many more, NI holds a Value grade of B, while MGEE has a Value grade of D.NI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

TNDM is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of t:slim X2 based on Control-IQ technology and new product launches. In the first quarter, the top line met the high end of the company’s expectations.  However, escalating operating costs and stiff rivalry are concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 62.5% compared with the 3.1% fall of the industry and a 1.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $1.72 billion. Tandem Diabetes projects an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.9% for 2024 compared with 24.9% of the industry. In the trailing four quarters, TNDM has an average negative earnings surprise of 415.6%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsQ1 Upsides: Tandem Diabetes’ first-quarter revenues were in line with its expectations. The company continues to capture a competitive share in the insulin pump market on the strength of t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology. Within supplies, TNDM witnessed an increase in cartridges and infusion set sales, with its in-warranty installed base growing to approximately 300,000 people at the end of the first quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe ongoing inventory transition to Tandem Diabetes’ European distribution center during the quarter witnessed a reduction in logistical supply chain challenges, strong international distributor relations and a closer correlation between pump shipments and pump placements on patients.t:slim’s Strong Prospects Continue: TNDM’s flagship product, t:slim X2 with Control-IQ technology continues to make a positive clinical impact in terms of overall satisfaction and ease of use and reduces the burden of diabetes management. The company looks forward to making t:slim X2 the first FDA-cleared insulin pump integrated with multiple CGM sensors.TNDM is working closely with Dexcom to finalize Control-IQ integration with G7 and  coordinate its launch. The integration of Control-IQ technology with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 and Libre 3 sensors is also underway.Story continuesProduct Innovation to Contribute: We are encouraged to see Tandem Diabetes’ pipeline of new products and services for the diabetes community, set to launch in 2023. Following the FDA clearance, the company is preparing to expand the diabetes solutions portfolio through the launch of the Tandem Mobi system. The Mobi pump is about half the size of t:slim and can be operated by a smartphone through a mobile application.TNDM is also working on t:slim X3, which is a technology upgrade to t:slim X2.DownsidesMounting Expenses:  In the first quarter, Tandem Diabetes came out with lower-than-expected revenues and earnings. The company registered a wider adjusted operating loss compared to the prior-year quarter on a year-over-year increase of 22.6% in SG&amp;A expenses and 27.1% in R&amp;D expenses.Tough Competitive Pressure: Tandem Diabetes operates in a highly competitive environment dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where Tandem Diabetes operates limit the company’s ability to switch to strategies like price increases.TNDM primarily competes with Medtronic’s market-leading MiniMed, a division of Medtronic. MiniMed boasts a major portion of the conventional insulin pump market share in the United States.Estimate TrendTandem Diabetes has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 loss per share has moved from 94 cents to $1.03 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $885.5 million.

149,3c2bc7f2-2b6d-3139-ba62-432630f47d98,PNR,2023-05-30,Strong Demand to Aid Lindsay (LNN) Amid Supply-Chain Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-demand-aid-lindsay-lnn-143200248.html,1685370720,STORY,"['LNN', 'WOR', 'PNR']","[Lindsay Corporation LNN is well-poised to gain from demand for its irrigation equipment supported by improving farm income in the United States as well as the need to replace an aging fleet. The performance of its Infrastructure segment will be supported by demand for the Road Zipper System. A strong balance sheet and focus on introducing technologically-advanced products will also aid growth.Demand for Irrigation Equipment Remains StrongThe USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) projects net farm income at $136.9 billion for 2023. The projected figure is 15.9%, lower than the figure reported in 2022 mainly due to elevated production expenses and lower direct government payments. Despite this decline, net farm income in 2023 will be up 26.6% from the 20-year average (2002-2021) figure of $108.1 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. Also, the need to replace aging equipment will sustain demand for the industry.The farm size has been on the rise in the United States, which requires more laborers. However, due to escalating labor costs every year, farmers are resorting to replacing labor with farming equipment. Also shifting to mechanized irrigation delivers significant advantages to farmers through water and energy savings, improved yield, reduced labor and cost-effectiveness. Lindsay is thus well-poised for growth in the years to come.In the company’s international markets, demand for its equipment has been high, supported by increased concerns around food security in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic. In the years to come, demand for agricultural equipment will be fueled by the increased global need for food.Momentum in Road Zipper System to Aid GrowthLindsay’s Infrastructure segment is benefiting from higher sales of road safety products and Road Zipper System project sales. The Road Zipper System is a highly differentiated product that delivers significant advantages by reducing congestion, lowering carbon emissions, improving commuter travel time and increasing driver safety.The Road Zipper Systems is gaining global popularity given its faster implementation and lower cost compared to the construction of new lanes. Lindsay launched an advanced Road Zipper Barrier Transfer Machine in January 2023 that ensures improved safety and efficiency with a bold new design and two advanced operator cabins.The U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act earmarking $110 billion to build roads, bridges and transportation projects  will translate into higher revenues for the Infrastructure segment.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet Supports Investment in GrowthLindsay also has a strong balance sheet, which will help it navigate the current global economic uncertainty. As of Feb 23, 2023, the company had available liquidity of $156.4 million, with $106.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $50 million available under the revolving credit facility.Lindsay’s capital allocation plan is to continue investing in organic growth and making synergistic acquisitions while enhancing returns to shareholders. Capital expenditure for fiscal 2023 is expected between $15 million and $20 million, including equipment replacement, productivity improvements and commercial growth investments.Supply-Chain Constraints PersistLindsay had been witnessing supply-chain constraints, particularly in electronics. It has also been facing higher input costs.  Even though the company is expecting an easing of cost inflation soon, it remains to be seen whether it will materialize. The recent dip in corn and soybean prices, amid improving supply prospects is concerning. Low prices, along with high feed, fertilizer costs and interest rates might impact farmer’s spending on agricultural equipment.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 6.5% in the past year, compared with the industry’s 2.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks To ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Worthington Industries, Inc.

This was driven by strong demand across the majority of the company’s business, and its ability to produce and ship despite several operating challenges.The company’s margin is gaining from the strong volume, an improved price-cost spread and tight cost controls, offsetting the negative impacts of supply-chain constraints, input inflation and production disruptions.

Orders remain strong in waste handling, and aerospace &amp; defense. A solid backlog and strong bookings will continue to support the segment’s top line.The Clean Energy and Fueling segment will gain from solid growth in below-ground retail fueling, fuel transport vehicle wash and industrial gases, coupled with acquisitions in Clean Energy and components.Given its backlog and pricing initiatives, Dover’s Climate and Sustainability Technologies segment is expected to post solid growth in the upcoming quarters. It is seeing strong demand conditions and top-line growth across all major business lines.The global investment in sustainability continues to drive the demand for heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems. The company’s margins will increase on improved productivity in food retail, strong volumes driving fixed-cost absorption and price-cost tailwinds.Effective Growth Strategies: Dover will gain from product digitization, e-commerce, product development and inorganic investment in core business platforms. The company is focused on investments in capacity expansions in high-growth businesses and productivity improvements across its portfolio. Dover also has a long tradition of making successful acquisitions in diverse end marketsDOV executed restructuring programs to better align costs and operations with current market conditions through targeted facility consolidations, headcount reductions and other measures, which will support its margins.Story continuesNear-Term ConcernsDoveris bearing the brunt of input cost inflation and component shortages. This has negatively impacted shipment volumes across many of its businesses. The company expects unfavorable foreign currency impacts, supply-chain challenges and labor constraints to continue through the remainder of the current year.Considering the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, Dover has decided to lower output in several businesses to  draw down inventory balances.

Consequently, oil stocks posted solid gains in 2021 and 2022.By the end of 2022, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, a broad oil sector ETF, had surged 238% from its lows in March 2020. However, oil stocks have given back some gains since the recent top. Now, this pullback presents several undervalued oil stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThere are various factors contributing to the weakness. Entering 2023, most analysts expected oil to catch a bid from China reopening. Demand would surge as travel and economic activity increased. However, the surge in demand from China has yet to materialize.OPEC announced an unexpected production cut on April 2. These developments took analysts by surprise. Could China’s demand be weaker? Or was oil suffering due to expectations of a recession in the second half? With this uncertainty, energy sector stocks have sold off year-to-date.However, the sell-off presents an opportunity for patient investors. Notably, entering 2023, oil stocks had the best fundamentals in the market. Indeed, they had strong earnings growth and cheap free cash flow multiples compared to other sectors.Now, after the sell-off, there are many undervalued oil stocks. Although earnings might decline slightly from historic 2022 levels, fundamentals are solid.Yes, a recession might hurt oil demand in the medium term. But hydrocarbons will continue powering economic activity as demand surges. So, consider these undervalued oil stocks for your portfolio.OXYOccidental Petroleum$58.84CVXChevron$154.87DVNDevon Energy $48.39Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Undervalued Oil StocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAfter the almost calamitous Anadarko acquisition in 2019, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has pulled itself from the brink of bankruptcy.Story continuesThe deal saddled Occidental with over $40 billion in debt. And just as the company was planning on asset sales and operating efficiencies to pay down debt, Covid-19 struck.Over the last two years, the company has had a remarkable resurgence. The Russian-Ukraine war and the ensuing oil spike have accelerated the return to financial stability. So far, the company has focused on aggressively paying down debt. In fiscal year (FY) 2022, the company repaid $10.5 billion in debt.According to the latest earnings report, the company has begun redeeming preferred stock.Due to its cost-cutting efforts, the company is massively profitable at current oil prices. Cash flow in the latest quarter hit $2.9 billion, and net income was $983 million. And it is using excess cash to buy back stock.In the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2023, they bought back $752 million of common stock.Now that debt is manageable and rapidly declining, the firm has pivoted to shareholder returns. Thus, analysts expect this undervalued oil stock to do well. Analysts have an average price target of $68.Besides, the stock is a bargain at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 10. The Oracle of Omaha also likes OXY stock. He holds over 24% of the shares outstanding. And he continues to buy more.On May 18, Reuters reported that Buffet added $201 million worth of shares.Chevron (CVX)Undervalued Oil StocksSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comRecently, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might have caught your attention after the huge political uproar from its massive buyback announcement.The company announced a $75 billion buyback after a record $36.5 billion profit in 2022. Politicians were unimpressed, claiming big oil companies were fueling inflation bythe move.Shareholders will benefit from the buyback since it will be accretive to earnings. Besides the buyback, you get to enjoy solid dividends. The company has a solid track record of dividend payments. It is a dividend champion, having raised its dividend for 35 years.Thus, if you are looking for solid oil stocks, Chevron is an option. It’s an integrated supermajor with one of the healthiest balance sheets and competent management.

Investors were unimpressed by the lack of capital discipline amid falling oil prices.But oil companies have rationalized capital expenditure. Instead, they are focusing on returns to shareholders. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) pioneered pivoting to a capital discipline and return to shareholder model.It offers a fixed plus variable dividend. Thus, as free cash flow rises, the variable component increases. Because of this change, Devon has had one of the highest dividend yields in the industry. When it delivers a great quarter, shareholders benefit as they receive a higher yield.Management has been committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. Year to date, they have already returned over $1 billion, as highlighted in the first quarter earnings release. Underlining this commitment, the board increased the buyback by 50% to $3 billion.After earnings, investors seemed disappointed despite the stellar results – including an all-time production record of 320,000 barrels per day. The stock sold offplummeting from October 2022 levels of around $75.This energy stock is one of the best undervalued oil stocks.According to TipRanks analysts, the stock is cheap. The average price target is $66 representing over 30% upside.Based on earnings, DVN stock trades at a forward P/E of 7. It has a modest debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6.

Yet all too often, our friends, co-workers, neighbors and family members suffer emotionally and either don't recognize the symptoms of a disorder or don't feel comfortable asking for help. And sometimes, we're the ones suffering in silence.Boston Scientific is committed to reducing the stigma of mental illness in the workplace and helping employees discover the tools, techniques and resources they need. Your employee benefits may vary based on where in the world you join us. For Mental Health Awareness Month, learn about the ways we support the wellbeing of our workforce in the U.S.1. Out-of-network? Not anymore!Access should never be a barrier to mental health care. Yet between the current national shortage of mental health providers and the cost of care in the U.S., it can often be difficult to find available providers within an insurance network, yet expensive to go outside the network. That's why Boston Scientific covers a range of services for behavioral and mental health - and should you require those covered services out-of-network, we simply cover it as though it were ""in-network,"" so you can get the support you need.2. Telehealth for adults and teensMental health among adolescents is worsening, continuing a decade-long downward trend, according to a distressing recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report; it discovered that 42% of high school students felt persistently sad or hopeless, and 22% seriously considered attempting suicide. Worried about your teenager? Think they may need to talk to someone? Virtual mental health appointments through Teladoc offer a convenient and cost-effective way of getting care for both adults and adolescents. Therapists are available by appointment via phone or video seven days a week to assist your teen with issues like school stress, family challenges, depression, eating disorders and more. And of course, they're always there for you and other eligible family members, too.Story continues3. Free counseling sessionsOur Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a no-cost, supportive service to help employees and their families address personal issues that may arise. It is staffed by master's and doctoral level clinicians who are prepared to listen and help you find ways to cope. We provide five free, confidential sessions per topic per year for employees and their household family members. (For example, you and each of your household family members could have five sessions for anxiety counseling and five sessions for grief counseling-up to five sessions per year for five separate topics.) In addition, EAP provides expert help to guide you through life stressors such as finances, elder care situations, parenting issues and legal needs.4. Therapy in your pocket 24/7Also available for free through our EAP, Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) is a digital self-care tool available anytime on your mobile phone. Created by a team of mental health professionals, it consists of simple, science-based activities, personalized to fit your life. Use the app to enhance your mental health and well-being, tackle stress and anxiety and improve mindfulness and sleep - on your schedule.5. A personal healthcare advocateNavigating healthcare can be a little like running through a maze: confusing, sometimes overwhelming, quite possibly endless. Wouldn't it be nice to have someone to guide you through the mental health journey? Guess what: Expert guidance is but a phone call away with our third-party health care advocates. Whether you're looking to find a therapist or understand your medication plan, need case management or admittance support or have billing or coverage questions, your advocates are ready to help simplify your healthcare experience at every point in the process.6. Year-round wellbeing webinars, seminars and eventsMental health awareness is integrated into daily life at Boston Scientific in so many ways. Take our fitness centers, for example, where you're encouraged to drop in for a stress-relieving workout, borrow a bicycle for a lunchtime ride or attend a calming meditation session. Throughout the year, you can also attend virtual seminars on a number of mental health topics or take advantage of our periodic on-site mental health fairs. In addition, we are rolling out a new training for people leaders in collaboration with Zevo Health to recognize common signs of mental distress and identify support for colleagues. And because a support network is crucial for mental health, our WellBeing SharePoint site, WellBeing Yammer group and LEAD (Leadership, Education and Allies for Disabilities) employee resource group give employees a place to connect and share.Learn more about what makes Boston Scientific a ""Best Place to Work"" by exploring its wide range of employee benefits.View original content here.Boston Scientific, Tuesday, May 30, 2023, Press release pictureOur benefits connect employees to the mental health care they need.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/boston-scientificEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758008/Six-Boston-Scientific-Benefits-That-Support-Employee-Mental-Health]"

The company’s revenues are expected to grow year over year. Growing services subscriber base and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts for Apple’s prospects.However, Apple expects the March quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to that of the December quarter due to unfavorable forex. For the iPhone, Apple expects the March quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate relative to the December quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth.For Mac and iPad, revenues are expected to decline in double digits on a year-over-year basis due to challenging comparison and macroeconomic headwinds.

The company was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too.Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.

On the flip side, pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, remains a concern.Global presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Key Themes at PlayAging Cars Creating Opportunities: A recent S&amp;P Global Mobility report reveals that a combination of limited supply and escalating prices is causing a decline in Americans' interest in purchasing new cars. The average age of vehicles in the United States has reached 12.5 years, indicating an increase of three months compared to the previous year and reaching an all-time high. This prolonged lifespan of vehicles is playing a significant role in driving demand for auto replacement and repair companies. To ensure the continued functionality of their aging vehicles, customers are choosing to invest in replacing faulty parts and components. As a result, there has been a noticeable surge in demand for auto replacement parts. Additionally, due to concerns about an economic slowdown, customers are anticipated to prefer repairing their older vehicles instead of spending excessive amounts on new, high-priced vehicles.Story continuesMounting Costs of Technological Advancements: The surging popularity of electric vehicles has compelled the industry to invest heavily in the development of technologically advanced auto components. However, these high technology costs are posing a significant challenge to the margins of auto replacement parts. As the industry strives to keep up with the evolving trends and demands of the automotive market, companies are required to continuously develop and upgrade their offerings. This necessitates substantial capital expenditure and research and development expenses. Consequently, the burden of these costs is likely to exert pressure on operating margins and cash flows within the industry.Commodity Pressures &amp; Forex Woes Squeeze Margins: The auto replacement parts industry is facing significant challenges as high raw material prices, particularly steel and non-ferrous metals, are putting a strain on gross margins. The inflation of commodities adds further hurdles and is expected to persist for a considerable period, hindering profitability. Moreover, the global presence of most industry players makes them susceptible to foreign exchange difficulties. Unfavorable currency translations are likely to impact earnings and margins negatively. Furthermore, the industry is grappling with logistical obstacles and disruptions in the supply chain systems, which further cloud the industry's outlook and prospects.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #184, which places it in the bottom 27% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 3% south.Despite the industry’s muted near-term outlook, we will present two stocks worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector but Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has declined 3.4%, narrower than the sector’s loss of 25%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has risen 1.7% over the same timeframe. One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 8.15X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.74X and the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 11.72X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.08X, as low as 6.76X and at a median of 9.44X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)2 Stocks Worth ConsideringGenuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. The acquisitions of PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group and the possession of full ownership in Inenco have bolstered the company’s growth. The KDG acquisition has strengthened Genuine Parts’ market-leading position on the North American industrial platform. The company's dividend aristocrat status boosts investors’ confidence. Genuine Parts approved a $3.88 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing its 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 5.8% and 4.2%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 8.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Genuine Parts — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A — topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 8.2%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price &amp; Consensus: GPCLKQ: Headquartered in Illinois, LKQ is one of the leading providers of replacement parts, components and systems. The buyouts of Elite Electronics, Green Bean Battery, SeaWide Marine Distribution, Greenlight and Fabtech Industries have bolstered the firm’s product offerings and sales. LKQ’s focus on cost discipline and simplification of its operating model are likely to result in sustained margin expansion. Low leverage and high liquidity are other positives that aid margins. LKQ has investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. We like the company’s commitment to increasing shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 5.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 6% and 8%, respectively. LKQ— currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A — topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other, with the average surprise being 2.5%.Price &amp; Consensus: LKQWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.5% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying P&amp;G, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PG a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $5.86.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.81bUS$6.32bUS$7.03bUS$7.14bUS$7.56bUS$7.88bUS$8.17bUS$8.43bUS$8.67bUS$8.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x12Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.29%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.86%Est @ 2.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$5.4kUS$5.4kUS$5.5kUS$5.1kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.1%) = US$141bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$141b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$62bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$110b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$193, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.086. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.
