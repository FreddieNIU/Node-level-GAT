2,0d7ffeda-9a1f-3d6e-bdbc-c1adb9ad03a8,USB,2022-12-05,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Wraps Up Deal to Acquire MUFG Union Bank,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-wraps-deal-120412415.html,1670241852,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Last week, U.S. Bancorp USB completed its acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core retail banking operations from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group MUFG in a cash-cum-stock transaction. This will bolster U.S. Bancorp’s presence on the West Coast.Under the terms of the deal, announced in September 2021, USB paid $5.5 billion in cash and issued almost 44 million shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock. At closure, MUFG holds a minority stake of roughly 3% in U.S. Bancorp.The systems integration and account conversion will likely occur in the first half of 2023. Until this happens, MUFG Union Bank customers will continue to be served by their respective branches, website and mobile apps.Notably, the deal doesn’t include MUFG Union Bank's Global Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, some middle and back-office functions, and other assets.Andy Cecere, chairman, president and CEO of USB, said, “The acquisition of MUFG Union Bank underscores U.S. Bank’s commitment to creating economic opportunities for our customers and communities across the West Coast.”Following the completion of the deal, MUFG continues to be one of the largest foreign banks in the United States. Kevin Cronin, MUFG Americas CEO and Regional Executive, noted, “We are very pleased to bring the sale to completion, which enables MUFG to increase our focus and direct our resources on accelerating growth in our Americas wholesale businesses.”Financial Benefits (At the Time of Deal Announcement)Assuming a 75% synergy phase-in and 8% accretion to earnings when fully integrated, the transaction is expected to be 6% accretive to 2023 GAAP earnings for U.S. Bancorp. The deal is estimated to be dilutive to 2022 earnings (including PAA and with foregone share repurchases) in the low single-digit percentage, while over the medium term, it is projected to be accretive in the low single-digit percentage.Additionally, U.S. Bancorp expects to achieve pre-tax cost synergies (40% of estimated non-interest expenses) of nearly $900 million via real estate consolidation, technology and systems conversion, and other back-office adequacies. Of these, 40-50% will be achieved in 2023 and the remaining in 2024. CET1 ratio is estimated to be 8.5% post the deal. Revenue synergies have been identified but not modeled.Further, the transaction is expected to contribute approximately $310 million to pre-tax pre-provision net revenues in 2022 before considering cost synergies. USB expects $1.2 billion in merger charges, of which $950 million will be incurred in 2022.Story continuesConclusionU.S. Bancorp has made a number of strategic acquisitions in the past years, which have opened new markets to it and fortified existing markets. These acquisitions, combined with the ongoing investments in innovative product enhancements, services and people, strengthened the company’s balance sheet and fee-based businesses.Over the past six months, shares of USB have lost 12.7% compared with 1.5% decline recorded by the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, U.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Walmart Inc. WMT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top 4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Enhance Your Portfolio in DecemberWe are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.U.S. stock markets are witnessing a solid rally since mid-October, which is likely to extend till the year-end. We have selected four Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to gain from the ongoing rally. These stocks are — Caterpillar Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Walmart Inc.Dow Suffers the LeastYear to date, the three large-cap-centric stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.4%, 14.5% and 26.6% respectively. On Dec 1, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index of Wall Street — technically exited bear territory after closing more than 20% higher over its recent low posted on Sep 30.The primary concern of the U.S. economy is soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has already hiked interest rates sharply by 3.75% year to date.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks rather than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for December and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, will be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Caterpillar’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply-chain snarls and cost pressures.We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries space is expected to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 27.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2% over the last 30 days.Walmart has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.9% over the last 30 days.UnitedHealth has been benefiting from a strong market position and an attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.UNH’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.

4,63b06e9c-74f2-40a0-9a1d-b7975d1c79f0,WMT,2022-12-05,Meet Yahoo Finance's 2022 Company of the Year: Costco,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-yahoo-finances-2022-company-of-the-year-costco-050135263.html,1670216495,STORY,"['COST', 'BJ', 'AMZN', 'TGT', '^GSPC', 'WMT']","[In a year of rampant inflation—not seen since the early 1980s—Costco (COST) was a warm hug to millions of loyal members by keeping prices for everything from food to gasoline as low as possible, just as rivals were aggressively jacking up prices.It also provided a warm hug to its fans on Wall Street, producing stellar results from sizable same-store sales increases to its stock price, which got the best of the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) index. Not to mention its sales of $222.7 billion in the fiscal year ended October, up a whopping 16 percent.For that and more—including Costco's continued status as one of the nation's best employers—we named the Issaquah, Washington–based warehouse behemoth our 2022 Company of the Year.If there were one company that could say rising prices weren't a negative, it was Costco. The Great Inflationary Outbreak of 2022 placed Costco's 842 worldwide stores squarely under the spotlight, offering up yet another opportunity for the 39-year-old retailer to showcase, to investors and members, its low-price leadership chops.Consider Cephas Sund from Los Angeles, California. The Costco cardholder, who loves organic products, says he shopped at conventional grocery stores prior to 2022, but skyrocketing prices put a hard stop on many of those excursions. ""When organic produce at the grocery stores is almost double what it cost at Costco, you (can) see where the savings quickly added up,"" Sund said.Sund and other customers we talked to said pretty much the same thing: Costco is a trusted retailer who had their backs throughout a challenging economic year. (That ought to tell you something.)How? As the cost of items like toothpaste and eggs soared, Costco in most cases was the last to raise prices at its cavernous 146,000-square-foot stores, explained Jefferies retail analyst Corey Tarlowe. ""The company is very strict on price, and I think that is evident through its steadfast commitment to its $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, competitive gas prices, and $4.99 rotisserie chickens,"" Tarlowe explained.Story continuesCase in point: As gas prices spiked to more than $5.00 a gallon in the summer, Costco saw lines at its hundreds of U.S. gas stations stretch out onto highways. Why? The company stayed true to its DNA as a wholesaler and kept gas prices at the lowest levels in town. Tarlowe says Costco's gas prices have typically been $0.25-$1.00 a gallon cheaper than the next closest competitor. (GasBuddy, a fuel station app, said Costco was the cheapest fuel station nationwide for the fifth year in a row. )Elizabeth Dragomir had to stand in a line of vehicles waiting for gas at Costco after a cyberattack crippled the biggest fuel pipeline in the country, run by Colonial Pipeline. Dragomir's car ran out of gas in the parking lot, in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., May 11, 2021. REUTERS/Jay PaulCostco held the line in other ways, too.As Walmart-owned Sam's Club jacked up membership prices by $5-$10 in September, Costco held firm. Execs said it wasn't the right time to tax consumers dealing with runaway inflation. (Sam's did undercut Costco's hot dog/drink combo by 12 cents. You can't win them all.)All of those warm embraces of customers was just Costco being Costco, long-time CEO Craig Jelinek told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview inside a new club opening in Lake Stevens, Washington.""I think first of all, we've been very fortunate. We've got great employees, and every company is only as good as everybody around them,"" said Jelinek, who has been with the company since nearly the time of its founding in 1984 by Jeffrey Brotman and Jim Sinegal. ""We've persevered and, we're very pleased that we've been able to get merchandise and continue to create value for our members and grow our membership base and drive sales.""This isn't a surprise to the retailer's long-time followers on Wall Street.Goldman Sachs' Kate McShane, for instance, has covered Costco for years. The company's focus on low prices and stellar operational execution is etched in the fabric of the retailer and has served the company well for years in good times and bad, she explained. The ""get it done"" mindset harkens back to the company's co-founders Jim Sinegal and Jeffrey Brotman, who created a no frills atmosphere that put the member at the center.""They're definitely one of the best run, best-in-class retailers,"" McShane said. ""We've not necessarily been that surprised Costco has been gaining market share as a result of some of the macroeconomic dynamics.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Experts like McShane believe Costco has gained market share notably in food throughout the pandemic, primarily from selling high quality private label products under its popular Kirkland Signature brand.Here are some Company of the Year worthy (and Wall Street-pleasing) highlights from the past year:Costco's same-store sales have out-performed conventional competitorsCostco's U.S. same-store sales for the nine-weeks ended October 30 increased by 10%. By comparison, third-quarter same-store sales for discounters Walmart (WMT) U.S. and Target (TGT) rose by a far slower 8.2% and 2.7%, respectively. Stacked up against its pure play warehouse rivals, Costco's recent sales growth trends are more in line. East Coast warehouse club rival BJ's Wholesale (BJ) saw third-quarter same-store sales increase by 9.7%. Same-store sales at Walmart's Sam's Club, increased 10% in the third quarter. But given that Costco is much bigger than the likes of Sam's, which has sales of about $59 billion, those same-store sales figures are impressive.Costco had a bang-up year within its key operating metricsFor the fiscal year-ended Aug. 28, Costco posted a 14.4% overall same-store sales increase; a 93% renewal rate for U.S. members; the addition of 7.3 million members; and a slight increase in net profit margins (a win in the hyper inflationary environment). Meanwhile, total cash clocked in at $11.1 billion, representing a hearty 34% of current assets.Despite 12-months of rock solid financial performance, the stock is down 13% this year, as of Dec. 2, but that still beats the S&amp;P 500 by a couple percentage points. Not bad in a year where bear markets reigned supreme.""We're really the extreme value proposition,"" Costco's 30-plus year CFO Richard Galanti told Yahoo Finance of the warehouse chain's financial success in a year of of eye-popping inflation.But like any other retailer, there are always uncertainties lurking.Analysts contend Costco's often relatively ""expensive"" price-to-earnings multiple — reflective of its years of steady and strong financials — requires the company to be perfect operationally at every turn.""The valuation on Costco, I can I can tell you, does give some people some angst because they are at such a big premium to the market. They're at such a big premium to Walmart and other big box retailers that some people don't totally understand why or they can't really bridge the gap between them,"" Goldman's McShane said.Costco didn't have a perfect November, as same-store sales growth cooled versus October, the company reported on Nov. 30. Investors promptly punished the often teflon stock on the view 2023 would bring further sales slowdowns.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Another wild card for 2023 is membership fees. Costco could raise them after years of holding the line, much to the disappointment of Wall Street. That would, of course, increase revenues and profits, but could also turn off some loyal, still inflation-weary, customers.Costco's last membership fee increase kicked in on June 1, 2017. The warehouse club took its Gold Star membership (the entry level Costco membership) fee up $5 to $60 and executive membership (offers 2% rewards on qualified purchases and other perks) fees increased by $10 to $120.""You're likely to hear something about this in the next (earnings) call in maybe six to 12 months, I think, and it'll probably be pretty likely that we'll hear something about it at least upcoming on the next earnings call,"" said Jefferies analyst Tarlowe. He estimates that a membership fee increase could boost Costco's earnings growth by a ""mid-single digit percentage"" rate. A Costco bull, he doesn't believe such a hike is priced into the retailer's already relatively expensive stock.Costco's CFO Galanti said the retailer isn't ready to raise the cost of its membership, but it will be something it clearly outlines to Wall Street when and if the time comes. Growth will also be driven by opening 20 to 25 new warehouses a year and the existing business drivers, Galanti added.In the meantime, Jelinek is paying careful attention to consumer spending this holiday season amid the mixed economic backdrop. Jelinek says he is pleased with the trends in the business to kick off the holiday shopping season, but does see a few warning flags that amount to uncertainties headed into 2023.""You know, a little bit. A little bit,"" Jelinek replied when asked if he sees a recession forming in the U.S. ""Our jewelry business has slowed down. If you look at the really high-end television sets, they've slowed down. I think right now people are very, very value conscious. They're always value conscious, but I think more so now than ever.""Obsessed with the $1.50 hot dog/soda combo at Costco like Brian Sozzi (left)? You can thank Costco CEO Craig Jelinek (right) for not raising the price of the combo, despite sky-high inflation.What the 70-year-old Jelinek may see forming, however, is a well-deserved retirement sometime within the next couple of years. In February, Costco promoted Ron Vachris to president and COO. He also joined Jelinek and Galanti on Costco's board of directors.Vachris, 56, has similar merchant DNA to Jelinek and Costco's founders. He began his retail career at the age of 16 at Price Club, which merged with Costco in 1993. Yahoo Finance briefly chatted with Vachris inside the Washington store opening — he was in true merchant form, walking aisles and chatting with members.Jelinek played any potential retirement announcement close to the vest.""Let's put it this way. He's [Ron] president. And we'll let it go at that,"" Jelinek said when asked about succession, adding he plans to be CEO ""for a while.""Costco's faithful members and employees surely would be OK with that timeline.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayBrian Sozzi, a former Wall Street analyst, is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.Since the start of 2022, the S&amp;P 500 Index has observed a decline of 15.5%. The index also remained in the bear market territory from mid-June to mid-July and from the third week of September to early November. As investors return after the Thanksgiving holiday, they are preparing themselves for the final interest rate hike of the year in December. The majority consensus is that the benchmark interest rate will be increased by 50 basis points (bps) to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% when the members of the Federal Reserve meet on December 14. The current benchmark interest rates are already at their highest level since 2008. The Fed has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 bps on the past four consecutive occasions. The raging inflation and increasing interest rates have dampened the sentiments of investors across Wall Street. Experts are anticipating the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance till the inflation rate falls below the 4% level. This will still be two percentage points (ppts) higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Inflation for October 2022 was recorded at 7.7%, which reflected a decline for the fourth consecutive month and is at its lowest level since January 2022. However, inflation is currently hovering at a four-decade high.Goldman Sachs anticipates that the bear market that has hit stocks this year could continue in 2023 as well. The New York-based diversified financial services firm believes that the recent recovery in stocks is just a knee-jerk reaction to the heavy losses that investors have faced this year. There are still three factors that need to materialize for the stocks to find a bottom. The first factor is that the valuations need to be more depressed to be in line with recessionary markets. Secondly, the business cycle should reach a true bottom in terms of economic deterioration before actual recovery occurs. Finally, the benchmark interest rates need to reach a peak. This has not been the case till now, as experts believe that the benchmark interest rate will reach a peak of 5.5% in 2023 before cuts start to take place in 2024. In such circumstances, investors are on the lookout for the best bear market stocks to shield their savings. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are attracting investors’ attention amidst bearish momentum in the markets.Story continues13 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 13 best bear market stocks, we have looked at the business fundamentals and operational efficiency of these companies.

(NYSE:NIO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“At the beginning of April the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”11. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Mondelez International, Inc.

Experts have highlighted Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) as one of the stocks with a strong upside potential due to its diverse range of products and presence across a wide variety of retail channels.

Mondelez International, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MDLZ) forward dividend yield stands at 2.33% as of November 30.Here’s what Coho Partners said about Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based beverage company known for its namesake brand and other leading beverages around the world.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted strong Q3 2022 results, outperforming consensus estimates. The momentum was driven by strong growth in organic sales that countered the adverse impact of currency headwinds. Following the results, Peter Grom at UBS increased the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $63 to $68 and maintained a Buy rating on October 26. The analyst added that the company’s risk and reward profile looks favorable, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.82% as of November 30. The company is also the fourth biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Here’s what Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare company that offers a retail pharmacy network, health insurance services, and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). The company is at the ninth position on our list of the best bear market stocks to buy now.On November 23, Erin Wright at Morgan Stanley assigned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $119 along with an Overweight rating. The analyst has an overall bullish outlook on the company’s long-term earnings prospects. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) offers an annual payout of $2.20, translating into a forward dividend yield of 2.18% as of November 30. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has also revealed that it is looking for acquisition opportunities that could advance the company’s broader strategy and increase its presence in key areas.Vltava Fund shared its stance on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Bentonville, Arkansas-based company that is considered the biggest retailer in the world through its hypermarkets, supercenters, and supermarkets.In an update issued to investors on November 16, Robert Ohmes at Bank of America highlighted that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is gaining market share in the middle of challenging and uncertain economic circumstances. The analyst anticipates the company to gain more market share in the grocery segment as it offers strong value through its everyday low prices (EDLP) strategy. The analyst increased the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)  from $155 to $165 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock following the strong Q3 2022 earnings results.Here’s what Leaven Partners said about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80AbbVie Inc.

Huynh thinks that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a strong drug pipeline, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in. Furthermore, the analyst thinks the guidance of 35% to 55% erosion in sales for Humira in 2023 following the expected launch of nine biosimilars is “too conservative.” AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.74% as of November 30.Baron Funds shared its bullish outlook on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Jersey-based diversified healthcare company that is involved in consumer health, medical technology, and pharmaceutical products.The company is working on spinning off its consumer health segment as a separate publicly listed entity to focus on its core medical technology and pharmaceutical businesses. Experts anticipate the spin-off will improve the valuation of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Furthermore, the company intends to reach revenue of $60 billion from its pharmaceutical business by 2025. The segment contributed a total revenue of $52.08 billion in 2021. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has provided the impetus to the medical technology division through the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) for $16.6 billion.

The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.55% as of November 30.Here’s what Mayar Capital said about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“J&amp;J is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions. This leaves JNJ with about 48 cents on the dollar in profit…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

If you want to read about some more stocks that Cramer and Dalio are bullish on, go directly to Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks.Ray Dalio, the chief of Bridgewater Associates, is one of the most respected hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Only stocks that Jim Cramer has also been bullish on in the past few weeks were selected. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These Stocks10. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. On November 29, McDonald’s said that its stores in Kazakhstan were forced to temporarily close this month after cutting ties with Russian companies and running out of supplies. Latest data shows that Dalio owned more than 2.1 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $487 million. On September 1, Jim Cramer placed the company among a group of dividend-paying stocks that he was bullish on for the coming months. He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On October 12, Costco declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The forwarded yield was 0.77%.

Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide.

Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

RJF have gained 1.5% since its announcement of enhanced capital deployment plans, including a dividend hike and a new share buyback program, last week. RJF's board of directors has announced a quarterly cash dividend of 42 cents per share, representing an increase of 24% from the prior payout. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 17, 2023, to shareholders on record as of Jan 3, 2023.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend came to $1.48 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of 1.41%, considering Raymond James' closing price of $119.16 as of Dec 2. This yield is attractive for income investors and offers a steady source of income.Raymond James has a track record of regularly raising dividends over the last decade. Prior to the recent hike, the company had announced a 31% increase in its quarterly dividend to 34 cents in December 2021.RJF raised its quarterly dividend six times in the last five years. Also, it has a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 14.5%. Currently, the company's payout ratio is 18% of earnings.Also, Raymond James' board authorized the repurchase of its shares of common stock, aggregating to $1.5 billion, with no expiration date. The authorization is higher and replaces the previous buyback authorization of $1 billion announced last December. Under the previous program, around $800 million remained as of Dec 1, 2022.Given a robust capital position and lower dividend payout ratio compared with its peers, the company is expected to sustain efficient capital deployment activities. Such moves are likely to drive shareholder confidence in the stock.Further, RJF remains focused on inorganic growth moves, supported by its strong liquidity position. This July, it acquired SumRidge Partners, which will boost its fixed-income capabilities. In June, it concluded the acquisition of TriState, while in January, it closed the acquisition of U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group PLC. These deals, along with several past ones, poise Raymond James well for future growth.The volatile nature of the investment banking business makes us apprehensive about Raymond James' prospects, as the performance of the business depends on market developments, client volumes and several geopolitical factors, which are subject to changes. Mounting expenses are expected to hurt the company's bottom line.So far this year, shares of Raymond James have rallied 18.7% against a 4.4% decline of its industry.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Raymond James carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Finance Stocks That Raised Dividends RecentlyFarmers National Banc Corp.’s FMNB board of directors approved a hike in the quarterly cash dividend.

10,da5d4249-7500-4a09-8c30-86f92ace114c,UAA,2022-12-05,Why some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that way,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-some-of-our-best-company-picks-didnt-stay-that-way-050200780.html,1670216520,STORY,"['GPS', 'UA', 'UAA', 'ZM', 'DIS', 'TGT', 'AM', 'BSQKZ', 'SQ', 'NVDA', 'META', 'MSFT']","[Our Company of the Year isn’t necessarily the company of the decade.Costco (COST) is the 11th annual Yahoo Finance Company of the Year (COTY). And a deserving one. But a look back at the list of prior winners contains a sobering lesson: greatness doesn’t always last.Our first COTY selection, for example, was Gap (GPS), in 2012. Believe it or not, the denim retailer was enjoying a resurgence back then, with the stock surging from 2011 to 2014. Since then, however, Gap has become the poster child for the old-school retail apocalypse, closing hundreds of stores, churning through CEOs and even inking a regrettable deal with one of the incarnations of Kanye West. Since peaking in 2014, the shares are down nearly 70%.Another stumbler, our 2013 selection, Disney (DIS), is still a blue-chip firm. But it hit a rough patch under the leadership of now-departed CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor, Bob Iger, is now at the helm once more, and he has a lot of fixing to do. Profits are well below pre-Covid levels and the stock is down 35% this year, more than twice the drop in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.Then there's former high rider Under Armour (UA). It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today.Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other Company of the Year setbacks?Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down. Shares soared in 2021, then plunged in 2022, and they’re now around where they were before the move into crypto. Block is back to Square 1.And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the ""meme"" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it’s down 87%%. Zoom out.Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so.Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation’s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up—including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises.Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don’t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory. We like companies that had rewarded investors—or, as with Costco this year, punish them less than the market as a whole. We also look for companies that capture the zeitgeist, as Costco did this year by helping consumers battle inflation. And we do, of course, hope our choices remain buzzy so we can check in on them in 10 or 20 years. Costco seems likely to meet that requirement.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG, MGIC Investment Corp. MTG and Radian Group Inc. RDN.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Dividend-Paying Multiline Insurers for a Stable PortfolioApart from price appreciation, investors look for returns on their investment in the form of dividends. Despite a choppy market, attributable to Fed’s hawkish move, concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a stronger dollar, the insurance industry has been gathering steam banking on solid fundamentals.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry has gained 0.9% year to date. Players like MetLife Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., MGIC Investment Corp. and Radian Group Inc., who have an impressive dividend history, continue to offer a stable income.By virtue of the nature of their business, multiline insurers stand to benefit from a diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations.Also, an increase in the exposure of intangibles and an increase in cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.The Fed’s strategic move to hike interest rates to curb inflation has been benefiting the insurance industry as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The Fed has already raised rates six times this year. Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, the higher the rates, the better the investment results. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Story continuesPlayers are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Dividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected five multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%. These stocks have a payout ratio of less than 60, reflecting enough room for future dividend increases. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Radian Group, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, is a credit enhancement company, which supports homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services.RDN witnessed five-year annualized dividend growth of 248.4%. Riding on continued financial strength and flexibility, Radian declared a 43% increase in quarterly dividends in the first quarter of 2022, which translated into the highest dividend yield in the private MI industry. Its current dividend yield of 4.1% betters the industry average of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 16. (Check Radian Group’s dividend history here)Radian Group Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Radian Group Inc. QuoteRadian’s mortgage insurance portfolio is expected to create a strong foundation for future earnings. RDN remains focused on improving its mortgage insurance portfolio, the main catalyst of long-term earnings growth. For 2022, Radian estimates total mortgage originations to be nearly $3 trillion, reflecting an 8% increase in purchase originations and a 58% decrease in refinance activity.Also, given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to see fewer claims than before. Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows. A strong capital position helps this Zacks Rank #2 insurer deploy capital via share repurchases and dividend hikes that enhance shareholders’ value.MGIC Investment, with a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, engages in the insurance underwriting and related services business primarily in the United States and Canada.MTG has an impressive dividend history, banking on a solid capital position. The largest private mortgage insurer in the United States increased dividends three times in the last five years. Its dividend yield of 2.9% betters the industry average of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 14, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 16.9%. (Check MGIC Investment’s dividend history here)MGIC Investment Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | MGIC Investment Corporation QuoteMGIC Investment expects new business, combined with increasing annual persistency, to result in the continued growth of the insurance-in-force portfolio. The multi-line insurer expects to retain higher levels of liquidity at the holding company. MGIC Investment, carrying Zacks Rank #2, has constructed a solid capital base to increase the long-term value to shareholders while maintaining financial strength and flexibility.MetLife, with a market capitalization of $60.1 billion, is an insurance-based global financial services company providing protection and investment products to a range of individual and institutional customers.Since 2011, the company has been successfully raising its quarterly dividend at a CAGR of 9.5%.  Its current dividend of $2.00 yields 2.6%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 27, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 4.7%. (Check MetLife’s dividend history here).MetLife, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | MetLife, Inc. QuoteThis Zacks Rank #3 company’s focus on streamlining its business, numerous acquisitions and partnerships, and balance sheet will drive long-term growth. MET has undertaken strategies to control cost and increase efficiency and remains optimistic about achieving a direct expense ratio below the target set for 2022. A strong balance sheet, coupled with sound free cash flows, supports its shareholder value-boosting effort.Prudential, with a market capitalization of $39.6 billion, is a financial services leader that offers an array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management and real estate services.PRU has been increasing its dividend for the past 14 years. Its dividend yield of 4.4% compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 47, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 8.5%. (Check Prudential’s dividend history here).Prudential Financial, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuotePRU is on track to reprice as well as move toward lower-risk and less capital-intensive products. As this Zacks Rank #3 insurer transforms to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive business, it expects to double its growth businesses to more than 30% of earnings and the individual annuities business to 10% or less of earnings. PRU remains focused on investing in businesses to expand its addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Prudential envisions about a 65% free cash flow ratio of earnings and about two times its dividend.The Hartford Financial, with a market capitalization of $24.1 billion, is one of the major multi-line insurance and investment companies in the country, providing investment products, group life and group disability insurance, property and casualty insurance and mutual funds in the United States.HIG increased its dividend at a five-year CAGR of 8.7%. Its dividend of $1.70 yields 2.2%. This Zacks Rank #3 insurer’s payout ratio is 21, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 9.5%. (Check Hartford Financial’s dividend history here).The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. QuoteHartford Financial has been vending non-core businesses to concentrate on its U.S. operations and enhance its operating leverage. HIG expects its Hartford Next initiative to bring cumulative savings of $560 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023.  Hartford Financial is gaining from lower COVID-related losses, an improved Commercial Lines loss ratio and a rise in earned premiums.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NYSE:MET) Looks Just Right",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metlife-inc-nyse-met-looks-110050520.html,1670238050,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PE']","[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 27.2x MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.MetLife could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for MetLife peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on MetLife will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is MetLife's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, MetLife would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 55%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 63% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 47% per annum during the coming three years according to the twelve analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that MetLife's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that MetLife maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for MetLife (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of MetLife's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

""Basically, they don't want any part of it.""As well as blocking the majority of Russian crude imports into Europe, the ban will have an impact of nearly every cargo across the world. That's because it bars European providers of insurance and shipping services from handling vessels carrying Moscow-controlled supplies.The sanctions are a bid to undermine Russia's ability to fund its war on Ukraine by curbing its crude export revenues, while the price cap aims to do this while maintaining a steady flow of fuel to western countries.But Russia has said it won't do business with any country that abides by the EU sanctions, while members of the OPEC+ group of oil producers stuck to their output cuts at their meeting Sunday — both of which could drive prices.""If [the price cap] actually works, I think it probably has a kind of gravitational pull on the price down,"" Yergin said.""The OPEC nations don't like it because they say: 'Well, wait — if the industrial nations are setting the price on Russian oil, some day will they set the price on all of our oil?' So you have OPEC+ versus the G7.""Story continues""But if Russia does do what they threatened to do — to take a million or 2 million barrels a day out of the market — then you'll see a very different price reaction,"" he added.Russia's Urals oil benchmark traded at $63.85 a barrel Monday. That's a significant discount to Brent crude, which is priced at $87.11 a barrel, and WTI crude, which changed hands for $81.44 a barrel at last check.""Some people say this will all work smoothly. But it could be very turbulent and reflected in prices,"" Yergin said. ""And you're really predicting, among other things, what is Vladimir Putin going to do. He's already made, obviously, a lot of miscalculations. He can do it again. ""So in a way, if you think about what happens in the oil market in the next few weeks, a lot depends on the decision-making by one Vladimir Putin and one Xi Jinping.""Commodities traders are watching for further signs Beijing will relax its zero-COVID curbs, which many analysts believe mean an economic reopening that would boost Chinese oil demand.""The big hit in the oil market is you're probably missing 700,000 barrels a day of Chinese oil demand,"" he said. ""So if China does begin to open up, we'll see the oil price respond on the upside.""Read more: EU sanctions on Russian oil take effect on Monday - here's what to expect and why the price cap may not yield any real resultsRead the original article on Business Insider]"

The move angered the US, and the White House accused the OPEC+ of ""aligning with Russia."" That's because tighter oil supply typically drives up prices, which may help prop up Russia's war chest, despite sanctions and boycotts over its invasion of Ukraine.On Sunday, the OPEC said the move was ""purely driven by market considerations.""Hopes of China's economic reopening from the pandemic are also boosting market sentiment.The expectation that the world's second-largest economy is finally eyeing an exit from COVID came after the country's top COVID official appeared to tone down the country's hardline COVID-zero approach last week. Several Chinese cities — including financial hub Shanghai and tech hub Hangzhou — relaxed strict COVID testing rules over the weekend.Story continuesThe events ""point to the beginning of the end of zero-COVID"" in China, although they do not point to a quick reopening for the entire country, Nomura economists said in a note on Monday. But there's certainly optimism surrounding the relaxation of COVID restrictions, Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Bank's head of economics and strategy, wrote in a Monday note.OPEC's decision came two days after the European Union and the G7 agreed on a $60 a barrel price cap for Russian crude oil — a move that creates uncertainty in the oil markets.Prices could jump to $120 a barrel next year if Russia cannot find enough ""dark ships"" — vessels that turn off tracking devices — to export crude covertly, analysts at Bernstein estimate. The price limit on Russian crude takes effect on Monday.However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow will not accept the price cap and has made ""certain preparations"" to counter the move, TASS state news agency reported on Friday.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Now it has to be implemented,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agreeing-russian-oil-cap-easy-093000019.html,1670232600,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Hundreds of Rail Tank Cars are pictured at the train cargo line of the LOTOS Oil Refinery on June 06, 2022 in Gdansk, Poland.Three months after initiating talks of a price cap on Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products, the International Price Cap Coalition is turning its words into action.On Dec. 2, the cohort comprising G7 member states—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US—the European Union (bar Hungary, which got a special exemption), and Australia set the price of Russian crude oil at or below $60 per barrel.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe group of the world’s most developed economies established the price cap “to prevent Russia from profiting from its war of aggression against Ukraine, to support stability in global energy markets, and to minimize negative economic spillovers of Russia’s war of aggression,” according to a joint statement.The new price on Russian-origin crude oil is meant to enter into force starting Dec. 5 For petroleum products from the region, the timeline is Feb. 5, 2023. Two prices for Russia’s petroleum—one for high-value and another for low-value refined products—are yet to be announced.Agreeing on the price cap was the first step of a longer process. The global oil transportation taps can’t be turned on and off on a single day of course. To ensure a smooth transition, the price cap will not apply to oil purchased above the price cap, which is loaded onto vessels prior to Dec. 5 and unloaded before Jan. 19, 2023.But when that deadline is reached, monitoring how the price cap is being honored will be a whole other task.The effect of a price cap, in the words of US treasury secretary Janet Yellen“The price cap will encourage the flow of discounted Russian oil onto global markets and is designed to help protect consumers and businesses from global supply disruptions. The price cap will particularly benefit low- and medium-income countries who have already borne the brunt of elevated energy and food prices exacerbated by Putin’s war. Whether these countries purchase energy inside or outside of the cap, the cap will enable them to bargain for steeper discounts on Russian oil and benefit from greater stability in global energy markets.” —US Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen Story continuesWhat is Russia’s reaction to the price cap?Russia will not accept the cap, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, quoted in Russian state-owned news agency TASS. He added that Russia would conduct an analysis of the agreement and respond after that.“Starting from this year Europe will live without Russian oil,” Mikhail Ulyanov, Moscow’s ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, wrote in a Dec. 3 tweet. The next day, he said that Russia’s deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, confirmed that Moscow would not supply oil to countries supporting “anti-market” cap.Russian oil in the world, by the digits14%: Share of global crude oil Russia supplies45%: Oil and gas contribution to Russia’s budget in 20212%: Small decline in Russian oil production since the invasion$65-70: The price cap G7 was considering, which would have had little impact because Urals were already selling to Asian countries for around that much$35: Steep discounted rate Russia offered India in March40%: Share total sea exports of Urals India purchased in November103: Shadow fleet of tankers Russia has amassed this year to sell oil and deliver to India, China and Turkey amid Western sanctionsCharted: Russian Urals’ price compared to global benchmark Brentdatawrapper-chart-Bglz0Why do we need price caps if Russian oil imports are banned?The US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and the EU swiftly introduced import bans on Russian crude and refined products after its February invasion of Ukraine. These bans still stand.“The price cap—which comes on top of the EU import ban on Russian seaborne crude oil and oil products, and the corresponding bans of other G7 partners—will further reduce the revenues Russia earns from oil…[and] serve to stabilise global energy prices which Moscow’s illegal war on Ukraine has inflated,” a Dec. 3 EU notification explained.The price cap applies to Russian oil being transported to third countries. For ships that intentionally violate the price cap, EU operators will be prohibited from insuring, financing and servicing the vessel for 90 days after the cargo purchased above the price cap has been unloaded.Will the price cap work?The opaque oil market, with its many nuances, is hard to regulate.“History has shown that it is possible for the shipping industry to misrepresent or obscure the origin of its cargo,” according to the Atlantic Council. The American think tank in the field of international affairs points to exemptions for certain pieces of the Russian production complex, such as the Sakhalin-2 project, which was heavily funded by Japan; and it says the cap doesn’t fully address blends that include Russian crudes, suggesting Russian barrels could be manoeuvred through refined or partially refined products.Moreover, there are several possible workarounds that make the plan less than foolproof, according to Brussels-based think tank Bruegel:Russia could organize its own insurance or use a third country, like ChinaImporting countries could circumvent the price cap through side payments. “Imagine for example that India pays a higher than usual price for arms deliveries from Russia. Could it be proved that this is a side payment for oil? Will the G7 be ready to enforce sanctions if that happens? It seems that the proposed buyers’ cartel is not very credible,” Bruegel analysts Klaas Lenaerts, Simone Tagliapietra, and Georg Zachmann warn.A less likely but still plausible move would be Russia cuts it oil supply, pushing prices upOne more thing: OPEC+ won’t change a thingOn Sunday (Dec. 4), the 23-nation oil cartel in the Middle East decided to stick to the reduced oil production targets it set in October—2 million barrels per day less until the end of 2023.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Eric Grossman, sold US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$102 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$92.10. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in Morgan Stanley than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Morgan Stanley Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Morgan Stanley insiders own about US$413m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Morgan Stanley Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Morgan Stanley shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Morgan Stanley insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Morgan Stanley that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.) on stablecoin regulations that could be introduced as early as this year. The bill would compete with alternative bipartisan legislation being drafted in the House Financial Services Committee.Lummis in particular has been a long-time fan of bitcoin. She told CoinDesk she first bought bitcoin in 2013, when the price was around $320, and has never sold it. Public records indicate the senator holds between $100,000 and $350,000 worth of the cryptocurrency.Lummis has made it her personal mission to educate her fellow senators about crypto, spinning up the Financial Innovation Caucus with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) earlier this year to bring in speakers to educate lawmakers at the staff level.Though Gillibrand has been less outspoken about crypto than Lummis, Fortune declared her constituent state of New York the “center of crypto startups,” with $6.5 billion invested at the beginning of this year. She has signed onto other pieces of crypto-friendly legislation as well, including the other major effort in the Senate to regulate the crypto industry – senators. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman’s (R-Ark.) Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA).Story continuesGillibrand and Lummis’ support for the crypto industry has earned them many supporters (and donors). Among them is now-disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who donated $40 million to Democratic candidates ahead of the November midterm elections. (Ryan Salame, co-CEO with Bankman-Fried of FTX Digital Markets, was a major Republican donor – a fact that has been lost in many of the reports on FTX’s political contributions.)Gillibrand was a recipient of at least $16,600 from Bankman-Fried, and has tried to wash her hands of him by promising to donate the money to charity.Lummis has also cited FTX’s collapse as evidence that more regulation is needed, and has said she plans to push ahead with the Responsible FInancial Innovation Act.“Transparent and fair exchange regulation … is essential to ensuring customers are protected while still promoting responsible innovation,” Lummis said.The collapse of FTX has also prompted many of Lummis and Gillibrand’s fellow senators, including long-time crypto skeptics including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), to call for urgent regulations to prevent further contamination and future collapses.Though Lummis and Gillibrand are continuing to work on crypto-related policy, their crypto cheering – so loud and consistent during the bull market – has gotten a lot quieter.]"

At least, the future as the pseudonymous non-fungible token collector imagines it to be – where everyone has a digital avatar that slips into the metaverse as easily as a bird flies through the air.“Here I am running around as a cartoon Punk, very seamlessly participating in communities and societies like I live in the physical world,” he told CoinDesk in an interview. Just “participating” in the metaverse is selling himself short, considering the work Punk6529 does advocating for, writing about and building this new digital frontier.This year, Punk6529, who takes his name from an eponymous CryptoPunk NFT, unveiled his own NFT fund, NFT museum and started work on what he calls the Open Metaverse, a blueprint for an online city. However, most would probably know him by his often-long Twitter threads spelling out the need for crypto, sent out to his nearly half-million followers.“We must ensure we take the pathway towards an open, interoperable future now,” he said. If that sounds like something a cypherpunk would say, Punk6529 wouldn’t disagree. In addition to being among the most savvy NFT collectors, he has built a reputation as a leading futurist, having spoken with Raoul Pal, Laura Shin and other luminaries on podcasts (often using a voice modulator).Like many other early bitcoin adopters, Punk6529 has a background in tech and finance that informs his views on those subjects today and the importance of crypto. He believes the world is on a “path dependence” to “persistent digital objects” or, in other words, is increasingly going digital.“Whatever ends up being the standard platform or API [for the metaverse] is going to end up being very important in a decade. If it’s a Facebook API or Apple API, it's going to be the same type of scenario that exists today,” he said. Although Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the metaverse his company is building will be interoperable, there’s reason to doubt that.Story continuesTo this end, Punk6529 has been self-funding a number of projects in an attempt to onboard people into a crypto-based metaverse. In April, he launched the free-to-roam museum district of his Open Metaverse, containing what he called “the most high-end art NFTs ever displayed in one place.” His stated goal is to get “​​100,000,000 people to use an NFT.”It’s a digital environment that can be scaled up, and that other people can build in, without anyone controlling it. Although Punk6529 has called this an “investment in the public,” he also believes that NFTs can one day be an “$80 trillion” category, if all “intangible goods” move onto the blockchain.Punk6529 currently owns over 850 NFTs, according to his OpenSea bio. But that isn’t counting his museum wallet with hundreds more. Prices have since decreased, but Punk’s known holdings were valued as high as $20 million this year.Not much is known about Punk6529’s IRL alter ego other than the small details he chooses to reveal. He apparently lived in downtown New York City, not far from Tompkins Square Park, for years, and used to consider himself a bitcoin maximalist. Although he wants to keep his metaverse avatar separate, he admits the glasses, the hoodie and the scruffy beard sported by CryptoPunk 6529 aren’t far off.“There’s a reason I didn’t choose a Mohawk Punk with a gold chain,” he said. “This is nerd-ville central.”]"
25,15eee504-072e-3ac9-9c7d-d06788b91492,FE,2022-12-05,Molly White and the Crypto Skeptics,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molly-white-crypto-skeptics-122044537.html,1670242844,STORY,['GC=F'],"[The headlines are brutal. They’re funny. They almost look fake. Just a few examples: “’Women-led’ NFT project, ‘Fame Lady Squad,’ turns out to be a bunch of dudes”; “Crypto.com wants back the $7.2 million they accidentally sent a customer last year”; “Bill Murray's NFT charity auction nets $185,000, which is then immediately stolen”; “CoinDesk reports that Decentraland has just 38 daily active users.”The headlines come from Web3IsGoingJustGreat, a blog that chronicles the many scams, hacks, hiccups, rug pulls, missteps and cringe of crypto and blockchain. “There are these enormous promises being made by people in the industry, of how Web3 is the future of finance and will solve every little problem” says Molly White, the 29-year-old software engineer and longtime Wikipedia editor who created and runs the site. She argues that Web3 boosters promise the future but ignore the present, that they’re “writing checks they can’t cash, and in the meantime a lot of people are taking the fall.”White is hardly the first crypto critic. Bitcoin is “fool’s gold and anybody buying it is ultimately a fool,” said longtime crypto antagonist Peter Schiff. Non-fungible tokens are “100% based on greater fool theory,” said Bill Gates. Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared,” said Warren Buffett. The space is a “house of cards crypto cesspool,” tweeted the economist Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini, who added a poop emoji.Most of these critiques boil down to “it’s all a Ponzi scheme” or “it’s all going to zero.” But the space has evolved and so have its critics. “The skeptical space has changed quite a bit,” says Cas Piancey, co-host of the “Crypto Critics’ Corner” podcast. Piancey says that he and his co-host Bennett Tomlin see the space “mostly as a scam” but that “we are open to the idea that there’s something valuable there. How valuable, we don’t know.”White, Piancey and the actor-turned-investigator Ben McKenzie are part of a new generation of crypto skeptics. More nuanced. Hyper specific. Fluent in the tech and the memes and the vibes.Story continuesFrom an intellectual perspective, sure, White finds much of the space interesting. She’s a software engineer, after all – she geeks out on tech. “One thing I think is important is to separate the interesting from the possible use cases,” she says. “There’s a lot of stuff that’s really interesting.” From an academic perspective, for example, she’s fascinated by the innovation with ZK (zero-knowledge) proofs, but “that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be world changing, or that the positive aspects of it will outweigh the negatives.”Just over a year ago almost no one in the crypto space had heard of Molly White. Now she’s serving on White House crypto panels, giving a speech (“Is Web3 bulls**t?”) to a packed crowd at Web Summit, shares commentary in mainstream news outlets (from The Verge to Vox, to Fast Company). As the Washington Post put it in a glowing profile, she’s “fast becoming the cryptocurrency world’s biggest critic.”And now with the meltdown of FTX, the icy panic of crypto winter and the latest drumbeat of crypto is dead, Molly White and the skeptics are having their moment.It all started with a unicycle.i. Moving the world forwardIn 2006, 13-year-old White enjoyed riding unicycles. She now describes it as one of her “really weird hobbies;” others would include creating Twitter Bots – like one that automatically added the word “cyber” to random nouns in headlines, making it sound like an uninformed tech journalist.White, like any normal online-savvy teen, looked up the Wikipedia page on unicycles. She found the page lacking. So unlike every other 13-year-old, she edited the page and fleshed it out. That was fun. What other pages could she edit? Soon she edited articles for bands like Disturbed, Evanescence and other emo rock.Soon she faced a problem that every writer dreads. “I kind of ran out of things to write about pretty quickly,” she says with a laugh. Emo-rock knowledge would only take her so far. How else could she contribute? “I realized there was this whole group of people who weren’t just editing the things they liked, but maintaining the website as a whole.” They copy edited. They cleaned up entries. They even fought Wiki-vandalism, like when political extremist groups would attack pages with spam and fake edits.What started as a lark turned into a passion. “As time went on I realized how important it is to have high-quality information available to people for free,” says White. You didn’t need to spend hundreds of dollars for an Encyclopedia Britannica. You didn’t need to live near a library. All you needed was the internet. “This feels so critical to sort of moving the world forward,” she says.White became a Wikipedia site administrator in 2010, while still in high school. She spent six years (non-consecutive) on the site’s arbitration committee – effectively Wikipedia’s Supreme Court. She kept editing Wikipedia while working as a software engineer for HubSpot. Eventually, she left the charm of unicycles for editing the grislier pages on incels, the far right and gender-based extremist groups.“Those guys do not appreciate my work, and are very vocal about it,” she says, again with a soft laugh. But with extremist groups there’s very little that’s funny. She says one “particularly persistent sort of stalker type” published her address, tried to publish her family’s address, sent her information to the Proud Boys extremist group and even threatened to send someone to her apartment posing as a hopeful renter, who would then take videos from inside her home – just “crazy, unhinged stuff.”She kept editing the pages. In total White has edited 100,000 Wikipedia articles, although she’s quick to point out this estimate is hard to quantify and “not really meaningful” because sometimes a simple click of “revert to prior version” can count as an edit.Whether it’s 100,000 articles or 10,000, all of the years editing Wikipedia taught her a few things. She learned to appreciate open-source communities and how to evaluate media with skepticism, honing what she calls good “[crap] detection skills.” And in late 2021, White came across a term that needed a Wikipedia article. A term that had no clear definition. A term that was widely used but perhaps not widely understood: Web3.ii. Just bonkersEditing the page for Web3 was not White’s first exposure to crypto. In the early 2010s, when still a teenager, she learned about bitcoin – then in its infancy – and even explained it to her family. She found much of it appealing. “It had a great online community, and a strong group of privacy advocates,” she says now. She didn’t consider buying any because “I wasn’t trying to buy drugs online, and that was the big use case.” As a teenager she didn’t happen to have random stacks of money sitting around for crypto speculation. But she remembers thinking, “Okay, cool, I love the idea of [bitcoin] funding whistleblowers.”Fast forward to 2021. White took another look at crypto and was startled by what she found. “I thought, how did we get from bitcoin funding dissidents to celebrities buying Bored Apes? What just happened?”So she would research what happened. White did what she has done for her entire adult life – she tried to track down sources, investigate and gain command of the subject. Except Web3 sources were tough to find. She scrolled through an endless stream of press releases that, as she describes it, were all about “this huge potential for Web3 and how you should definitely pay attention to it” but “never would say what Web3 actually was. You couldn’t just get a two-sentence description.”White’s first tweet that mentioned Web3 came on Nov. 10, 2021: “wrote a whole wikipedia article on web3 last night and i still don't think i know what it is.” So she kept investigating, kept reading, kept marveling at the absurdity – the projects she thinks of as “just bonkers,” where “people were doing the weirdest stuff with blockchain.”Take, for example, a blockchain project called “Realms of Ruin,” where a group of bestselling Young Adult fiction authors would create an imaginary universe – they’d establish the setting and characters – and fans would write fiction to contribute to this world. The fans could mint these stories as NFTs, and buy and trade NFT character artwork.There were many questions about the project. Who will own the intellectual property of these kids’ stories? Are the fans being paid for their work? “I remember seeing that and being like, “They’re trying to get kids to buy NFTs,’ says White. It seemed crazy. Most fans of YA, almost by definition, are young adults. They’re not 18. The whole idea struck her as poorly thought out, and likely a cash grab. Realms of Ruin was not long for the world – within five hours of going public the project was scrapped. (Part of this was because of an outcry over NFTs’ environmental impact; CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon offers an alternate take.)White acknowledges that the intentions of the project could be innocent, but argues that good intentions are not enough. For her, that’s a global theme in crypto. “I think there are a lot of people who are running these crypto projects who genuinely believe in what they’re trying to do, and have good intentions around empowering artists,” says White. “But I also think that it’s really important to pay attention to the impact, as well as the intention.” In the case of Realms of Ruin, she says, you have to make sure that “you’re not just ripping off these kids.”The more White explored the space, the more projects she found that seemed misguided, goofy, grifty, predatory or somehow likely to cause harm. And it felt like there was no one publication or website that captured all of the collateral damage in one place. Most mainstream and crypto publications, says White, tend to mostly cover the “good” side of the crypto coin.Enter Web3isgoinggreat. She started the site as one of her many “dumb hobby projects” that she does for kicks, like the time in college when, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, whenever she read articles about Hillary Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, her mind would first see this as Clinton and Kanye, as in Kanye West. This amused her. So she wrote a script that changed Kaine to Kanye, a joke that has aged either poorly or gloriously.White didn’t think Web3isgoinggreat would get much traffic. But the site quickly found eyeballs and traction from HackerNews and “Buttcoin,” a crypto skeptic subreddit. People began to notice.The site is funny and droll, almost a throwback to early Gawker and the 2008-ish era of blogs. At first she tried to write it in her neutral Wikipedia-editor voice, but the jokes just came too easily. “Some of the stuff is so stupid,” she says, “and you just can’t help but laugh.”White has a film critic’s gift for spotting a target and dryly, without mercy, ripping it to pieces. “An up-and-coming crypto scam – er, project – has managed to dunk on crypto bros better than any satirist i've seen so far, with one of the most painful-to-watch youtube videos i've seen in a while. join me in hell as we watch this together,” she tweeted on Jan. 4, 2022, beginning a thread that gleefully mocked the project “Crypto Land.”The thread went viral. It put her on the crypto radar – as did Web3isgoinggreat’s cameo in Dan Olson’s “Line Goes Up – The Problem With NFTs” two-hour video, which now has 9 million views and counting. Her site (and her tweets) became must-read media for many in the space.A self-described introvert, at first White was reluctant to speak to journalists, appear on podcasts or speak at conventions. In 2022, when the White House asked her to be part of a panel on cryptocurrency, her first reaction was, “What? I’m a software engineer who just makes jokes about crypto in her spare time.”Eventually, she began saying yes. She said yes to giving a lecture at Stanford on Abuse on the Blockchain. Yes to appearing on podcasts. Yes to the White House. (This stemmed from President Biden’s Executive Order to research crypto; White was asked to give a statement to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which she published here.) 2022 would be the year of yes.The reason for White’s change of heart? She had a realization. “It felt like so many people in crypto were speaking so confidently about things that they know nothing about,” she says. “Well, I know at least as much about this as they do.”iii. The temperance movementIf a critic says, “Crypto is all a Ponzi scheme” or “crypto is all a scam,” this is relatively easy to refute. One counterexample is enough to do the trick. Oh, so crypto is all a scam? Tell that to the Ukrainian troops who received immediate global fundraising thanks to crypto.What makes the critiques of White, Piancey, and the other skeptics so effective is they acknowledge the occasional use cases, they understand the tech, they have taken the time to research the space and, after all of their analysis, they believe, on balance – in the real world of today (as opposed to the Web3-powered utopia of tomorrow) – the bad outweighs the good.“The experiment of bitcoin is really cool,” says Cas Piancey. “There’s nothing to argue about that. I love the idea of a non-nationalized currency.” And Piancey says there can be the occasional use for cryptocurrency, such as a Chinese dissident receiving funds that are censorship resistant. Yet, how common is this? “That’s a niche use case,” says Piancey, “but the reality is that it’s not something that’s going to dominate the world.”This is a similar worldview to one held by Jacob Silverman, a longtime tech reporter and fellow crypto skeptic. “I’m not on a mission to burn it all down. I don’t have an activist mission,” says Silverman. In August 2021, Silverman received a random direct message from the actor Ben McKenzie (of “The OC” fame), asking if he wanted to talk about crypto. “He jokes now that he slid into my DMs,” says Silverman.They met for beers and burgers. They clicked. They talked about the problems with crypto, they swapped ideas, they traveled to conferences together, they did research, and then they sold the book “Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud,” slated for a July 2023 release. In a description that crypto bulls will find chilling or dismiss as FUD, the book promises an exposé that “points in shock to the climactic final days of cryptocurrency now upon us.” (Especially in the wake of FTX, McKenzie has taken a flamethrower to Crypto Twitter. “If you think FTX is the worst/biggest fraud in crypto, I have bad news for you,” he tweeted. Good luck to the players remaining at the table.”)FTX is now an easy (if perfectly appropriate) target. And although White and I happen to speak during the implosion of FTX, for an example of Web3 going sideways she points to something less obvious: Axie Infinity. On the surface, sure, there’s the $620 million hack, which might have involved the North Korean government. But look deeper. “The project itself is a good example of how crypto incentives are often really twisted,” she says. Axie Infinity was the poster child of the “play-to-earn” game, which White admits is an attractive concept – you gobble up crypto rewards for doing something you already enjoy. This is a fine theory. (It’s a theory I’ve written about, repeatedly.)Then Axie took a darker turn when people tried to squeeze as much alpha as possible from the project, effectively loaning capital to groups of low-wage workers in places like the Philippines and Venezuela. (The cartoon blobs could cost $300 or more.) So in White’s view the loaners of capital, more or less, became landlords exploiting people – often in poor working conditions – who were grinding out the game. “This is certainly a far cry from the idea of a fun game you play after work, and also making a few bucks,” says White. She suspects that even without a hack the game would have cratered because “the whole economical model is completely unsustainable. There was no actual value being created by [people] battling Pokemon.”Okay, so maybe NFT play-to-earn isn’t her jam, but what about NFTs in general? Can’t they have merit? Don’t they empower artists? (I’ve long viewed this as a win for crypto.) White is happy to see creators monetize their work, but argues that this has very little to do with blockchain, decentralization or breakthroughs in technology. “The revolution here is not the tech,” she says. “The real change is the speculative bubble that emerged around it.” From this perspective, artists are “empowered” because a cadre of millionaires became billionaires and the froth has trickled down.NFT advocates have a comeback: But there is a technological breakthrough. Now, thanks to blockchain, for the first time, people can truly prove ownership of digital assets. This allows for digital scarcity. This fundamentally changes the online game.White has a quick comeback to the comeback: “The technologically interesting thing [about NFTs] is not the cryptocurrency, it’s the cryptography,” she says. “That’s something that we can do for decades.” In one of many essays, she laid out the technological steps – using something called PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption – for an artist to sell unique digital goods without using blockchain. The tech has been there all along. No artists have been using this tech, says White, because there has “never been a speculative market.” When the hype around NFTs dies down, she suspects the markets will dry up.Part of White’s exasperation is that many in the space view blockchain as a solution for every problem, and seem ignorant of all the work that had come before crypto. Take decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). “A lot of them are saying that, for the first time, now we’re going to be an online self-governing community, unlike everything else on the internet,” White says with a laugh. “Well, no. That’s not really true.” She found this particularly amusing given her 15 years with Wikipedia, a highly functioning (if imperfect) online, decentralized, self-governing community.Don’t get her started on the Web3 projects that try to make a “better Wikipedia,” but with crypto. “Those projects have hilariously failed in several different instances,” she says. To her it smacks of hubris. While the idea was to pay people with tokens to edit – seems reasonable – this creates what White argues is a flawed incentive model. One incentive is to create high-quality information. Another incentive is to make as many edits as possible so you can rack up more tokens. “Those two things are not aligned,” she says.Sure, maybe you can cleverly tweak the incentives towards some kind of voting model, but even that will eventually get gamed, says White, in a kind of “I’ll vote for your spam edit if you vote for my spam edit.” In yet another viral Twitter thread, she excoriated “Golden,” a prominent Wikipedia-but-with-crypto project, noting that “70% of the article on ‘Dog’ is dedicated to the Shiba Inu,” and that “there is no article on carrots, the vegetable. There are, however, articles about many different companies and cryptocurrencies with that name.”The crypto community, of course, has a classic defense for most of these arguments. It’s still early. Blockchain is in the early 1990s days of the internet. “I got so tired of that argument,” White says, and has two rebuttals: “One is that it’s premised on the argument that blockchains are equivalent to the internet in some way, that they’re similarly revolutionary.” The internet was clearly transformative to nearly every slice of culture; why should we presume that Web3 will have the same sweeping impact, and therefore allow the same leisurely timeline?Her second response: It’s flawed to apply the developmental time frame from an early tech to a later generation tech. Take computers and the internet. It took decades to develop the transistors, CPUs and hardware that would lead to modern computers. By some accounts, the invention of the computer dates back to the 1830s and Charles Babbage, a British mathematician, who devised plans for an “Analytical Engine.”Progress begets progress. The internet developed faster than the computer because no one had to reinvent laptops. Blockchain should develop even faster. “Every technology basically develops exponentially quicker than the one before it,” she says, and expands the argument in an essay “It’s not still the early days.” Or as Silverman puts it, “Crypto has been around for 13 years, almost as long as the iPhone.”Whether you agree with Molly White or not – and I, personally, confess to more optimism for the space – you can benefit from exposure to her arguments. Debate is healthy. And skepticism is a core ingredient for intellectual honesty. Skepticism is good for the individual and, I would argue, good for the industry at large.“You need skeptics,” says Piancey. “You need people to head-check you.” He estimates that the majority of his podcast’s subscribers are bullish on crypto, and they’re listening to understand and appreciate the other side.We’ve been hearing, for years, that “crypto is the future.” That might still be true. But ultimately, says White, we need to “temper these really optimistic visions of the future with how the technology is functioning today.”And in 2022, whether people liked it or not, the skeptics delivered that temperance.]"

Since then, the team developing Zcash have continued to innovate – pushing the boundaries of computer science and cryptography.This year has been no different. In an interview with CoinDesk, Zooko Wilcox, CEO of the company leading Zcash development, the Electric Coin Company (ECC), discussed the protocol’s much-anticipated NU5 upgrade that went live in May.The upgrade did many things – it came with a shiny new wallet and software development kit – but above all radically improved privacy across the network while reducing the amount of trust anyone needs to have in Wilcox, ECC or Zcash itself to transact anonymously.And it couldn’t have come at a better time. In August, the U.S. Treasury Department levied unprecedented sanctions against the crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash, effectively barring U.S. users from concealing their blockchain history on Ethereum.“This was the year the crypto industry woke up to the fact that fully transparent protocols are vulnerable. They're capturable. They're attackable. And this is what we've always believed; like, this is why we started Zcash,” Wilcox told CoinDesk.Zcash’s 2022 overhaul saw the introduction of a new type of zero-knowledge proof system called Halo (zero-knowledge refers to a system where someone can prove they know information without revealing that information). Developed by ECC engineer Sean Bowe, Halo is said to be the first “trustless and recursive” ZKP. These are “technical terms,” Wilcox said, while removing his retainer – but it’s a big deal.Today, almost all encrypted apps and protocols are built on top of something called a “trusted setup,” a special type of procedure where private keys are generated, including Zcash. Obviously, “trust” runs antithetical to what crypto is trying to achieve – if someone gets hold of a protocol’s key, they can compromise the entire system.Story continuesThis was always the critical vulnerability at the heart of Zcash, even though the protocol’s key ceremony is legendary in cryptography circles for the lengths its six participants, spread across the globe, took to maximize security.(As it turns out, human rights activist Edward Snowden was one of the few people involved in Zcash’s weekend-long creation, privacy advocate Naomi Brockwell reported first in CoinDesk.)“Our previous generation of zero-knowledge proofs is pretty much the gold standard throughout the industry. A lot of the science and source code we developed has been copied and reused by almost everyone,” Wilcox said. However, no matter how trustworthy Zooko or Snowden were perceived to be, they were still partial key holders and therefore centralized points of failure that had to be eliminated.It’s likely that Halo’s new “trustless setup” will also be widely adopted and set a new bar for encryption. The practice also solves the issue that in the distant future, some people might lose faith that some key ceremony was not compromised. Now, anyone can just crunch the math to know the system is computationally secure, without having to take Wilcox’s word for it.“We see Zcash as a fundamental, permanent part of humanity's legacy and toolkit,” Wilcox said.In addition to removing a gigantic attack surface on Zcash, Halo’s implementation also makes the system highly scalable by the introduction of a new kind of z-SNARK (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) called a PLONK. (ECC’s blog said the innovation here is by “allowing any amount of computational effort and data to produce a short proof that can be checked quickly.)In the months since the upgrade was deployed, a number of projects have started using PLONK-based privacy apps – from ZK EVMs (ethereum virtual machines) to Filecoin’s decentralized storage system and even a machine learning AI program.Considering the “Cambrian explosion” of ZK implementations in the past half decade, and the fact the ZK proofs were mostly an arcane, academic topic since the 80s until recently, Zooko said he thinks the crypto industry’s continued experimentation “goes sort of unacknowledged.”“The cryptocurrency phenomenon has unlocked an economic sustainability for all kinds of technological development,” he said, referring to token-based crowdfunding. “It's really underappreciated how the economic effect of decentralized and diverse and permissionless innovation being able to get funded without having to depend on the legacy gatekeepers and controllers.”As it turns out, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took aim at Zcash this year for its controversial funding model and “premine” – alleging the project may be a security. This caused many of the few exchanges that had listed ZEC to drop it and other privacy coins, like Huobi. In fact, concerns over centralized control by Zooko and ECC over Zcash have long-plagued the project.Zooko seems zen on that point. In our interview, he admitted to settling into the idea that he’s the face of the blockchain that resembles his name. “Having a recognizable spokesperson is pretty necessary,” he said. “But I think people are really oversimplifying and wrong if they think that Zcash depends on that.”]"

(NYSE:MSI) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 11% on the 13th of January to $0.88, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.79. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.2%, which is below the industry average. View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions Motorola Solutions' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Based on the last payment, Motorola Solutions was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 66.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMotorola Solutions Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.88 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.16. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Motorola Solutions has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Motorola Solutions Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Motorola Solutions is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Motorola Solutions that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

And a deserving one. But a look back at the list of prior winners contains a sobering lesson: greatness doesn’t always last.Our first COTY selection, for example, was Gap (GPS), in 2012. Believe it or not, the denim retailer was enjoying a resurgence back then, with the stock surging from 2011 to 2014. Since then, however, Gap has become the poster child for the old-school retail apocalypse, closing hundreds of stores, churning through CEOs and even inking a regrettable deal with one of the incarnations of Kanye West. Since peaking in 2014, the shares are down nearly 70%.Another stumbler, our 2013 selection, Disney (DIS), is still a blue-chip firm. But it hit a rough patch under the leadership of now-departed CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor, Bob Iger, is now at the helm once more, and he has a lot of fixing to do. Profits are well below pre-Covid levels and the stock is down 35% this year, more than twice the drop in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.Then there's former high rider Under Armour (UA). It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today.Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other Company of the Year setbacks?Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down. Shares soared in 2021, then plunged in 2022, and they’re now around where they were before the move into crypto. Block is back to Square 1.And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the ""meme"" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it’s down 87%%. Zoom out.Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so.Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation’s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up—including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises.Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don’t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory. We like companies that had rewarded investors—or, as with Costco this year, punish them less than the market as a whole. We also look for companies that capture the zeitgeist, as Costco did this year by helping consumers battle inflation. And we do, of course, hope our choices remain buzzy so we can check in on them in 10 or 20 years. Costco seems likely to meet that requirement.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to read about some more stocks that Cramer and Dalio are bullish on, go directly to Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks.Ray Dalio, the chief of Bridgewater Associates, is one of the most respected hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Only stocks that Jim Cramer has also been bullish on in the past few weeks were selected. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These Stocks10. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. On November 29, McDonald’s said that its stores in Kazakhstan were forced to temporarily close this month after cutting ties with Russian companies and running out of supplies. Latest data shows that Dalio owned more than 2.1 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $487 million. On September 1, Jim Cramer placed the company among a group of dividend-paying stocks that he was bullish on for the coming months. He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On October 12, Costco declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The forwarded yield was 0.77%. On November 28, Costco Dropped the Price on Its Internet-Famous Thomasville Sectional to Just $2,500 for Cyber Monday. 13F filings show that Dalio owned more than 1.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $566 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company was building everywhere, including big projects in China, and did not want to raise their membership fees because it was part of a larger plan by the retail giant to pressure the competition.   On November 29, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock and lowered the price target to $578 from $581. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide. On November 17, PepsiCo declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share with a forward yield of 2.85%. New data reveals that Dalio owned more than 4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $656 million. Jim Cramer recently lauded the “other-wordly” numbers posted by the firm in a bear market.  On October 14, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman maintained an Overweight rating on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stock and raised the price target to $185 from $183, highlighting the company's beat and raise in the third quarter.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 65 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.3 billion in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), compared to 62 in the previous quarter worth $4.9 billion.Alongside Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also in the stable and predictable cash flow camp, though with a very different business model, global food and beverage company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reported very strong organic growth in the first quarter, driven by healthy price/mix, and raised revenue guidance, while holding EPS guidance. Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

41,95287e6b-62ac-3dae-9aee-375ec1485a07,SPG,2022-12-05,5 Strong Retail Stocks Worth Ringing Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-strong-retail-stocks-worth-164210895.html,1669912930,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', 'COST', 'M', 'SPG']","[It’s a month before Christmas and crumbs falling off vests, the traders have put down their last bets on retail stocks. The positions are hanging on desks with great care while out in the world the best deals sit there. The events of The Night Before Christmas took place just a few miles from Wall Street, in what’s now the Chelsea neighborhood. Author Clement Moore later became wealthy by dividing his estate into smaller lots.A fitting start to the modern celebration of mass merchandising and conspicuous consumption. Retailing has changed a lot from what it was in Moore’s Day when the Ladies Mile of clothing stores defined high-end shopping. But the model has only been fully replaced recently, as department stores gave way to discounters and online merchants.This is the age of the “omnichannel,” with success defined as much by shipping as by marketing, as much by technology as by merchandising. The 21st century has reshuffled the retailing deck. But it can easily be reshuffled again, with some of the top retail stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis year, it might be.WMTWalmart$151.60TGTTarget$163.73COSTCostco$506.28MMacy’s$23.11SPGSimon Property Group$118.32Retail Stocks: Walmart (WMT)walmart stockSource: ShutterstockOne of the top retail stocks to buy is Walmart (NYSE:WMT), America’s biggest and possibly smartest retailer. Sales for fiscal 2023, which as with most retailers ends in Jan. after post-Christmas returns and inventory are taken, should grow 5.5% over last year. Operating cash flow last year came to $15.7 billion. For the three months ending in October, sales were $152.8 billion, but there was a loss of $1.8 billion, 66 cents/share.That’s because, as with great retail companies, Walmart keeps spending even when sales fall. Walmart spent $4.5 billion on dividends and share repurchases in the last year and had capital expenses of $12.1 billion. Still, the company predicts 3% growth this holiday season and has now raised its outlook for the full year to 5.5%. Growth is fastest at its international unit and Sam’s Club warehouse stores., where sales grew nearly 13%.Story continuesWalmart is spending big on technology, trying to replicate Amazon.Com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) online operations, at least in the U.S. market. One big innovation that has been copied by others is using its stores as fulfillment centers. It also has a membership program called Walmart Plus, which includes free shipping.This makes Walmart a pure value play, falling behind the averages when growth is in fashion, and catching up when profits are demanded. This has been a catch-up year, the shares are up 6% while the average S&amp;P stock is down over 15%. But the rush to quality has brought its price-to-earnings ratio up to an eye-popping 47 and the dividend yield down to 1.46%. This Christmas season, Walmart’s dominant position will remain, according to Placer.AI, which measures store visits. If you see the stock on sale, at say $150-$152/share, TheStreet.Com says buy it. But as with anything else, you pay up for quality.Retail Stocks: Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockUnder Brian Cornell, who became CEO in 2014, Target’s (NYSE:TGT) returns were easily beating those of Walmart, until recently. In 2022, supply chain issues and organized theft clobbered the stock. Over five years it’s up 177%, but since Jan., it’s down 29%.This was reflected in third-quarter earnings, which were cut in half from a year ago at $712 million, $1.55 per share, on sales of $26.5 billion. Management also cut its guidance for Christmas sales to 3%. While Target is often compared to Walmart, it’s just one-sixth the size. This can increase volatility. When it was growing fast, late in the last decade, the stock zoomed. As growth slowed in 2022, it nosedived. The third quarter numbers sent it down 13%. But that weakness isn’t reflected in store visits, says Placer.ai. Store visits to Target are growing faster than those to Walmart, and its share of the market has held steady.I’m a long-time fan of Cornell. I liked his moves in the 2010s to build smaller, urban stores, and to improve online delivery. What I like better is his willingness to adjust. Target is now going directly after Walmart with a 150,000-square-foot store design that can also act as an online fulfillment center. This lets it deliver orders to many customers the same day they’re placed. Change is constant, and the best retailers recognize that.Its recent problems have made Target a cheaper stock. The price-to-earnings ratio is now below 23 and the dividend yield is above 2.6%. The market cap is just 75% of the store’s sales. When I see those kinds of prices, on quality merchandise, I call it a bargain.Retail Stocks: Costco Wholesale (COST)Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession PickSource: ShutterstockCostco runs have become as popular as beer runs in America’s high-end suburbs. Over the last five years, the stock is up over 188%, and even in 2022, the shares are up 6%. The key is that Costco doesn’t sell. Instead, it creates an environment where people happily buy in mass quantities. The warehouse concept, of buying in bulk, and paying a membership fee for the privilege, helps justify America’s desire for SUVs and oversized houses.The result for Costco is double-digit growth, even when currency losses in its international unit are factored in.  Earnings, which once averaged no more than its take from membership fees, have now gone far beyond that, to $5.84 billion in the 12 months ending in August.Following Costco has become a cottage industry at sites like Eat This, Not That. Some shoppers camp out next to a new store before its opening.Costco is a quality name, but you pay for quality. Sometimes you can pay too much. We saw that a year ago with companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Will we see it next year with Costco?The dividend of 90 cents/share now yields just 0.68%. It’s been low for years. But the price-to-earnings ratio is over 40. You’re paying more for Costco earnings than those of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Macy’s (M)Macy's stock m stockSource: ShutterstockMacy’s (NYSE:M) is one of the last of the giant department stores that dominated retailing in the 20th century. It was left for dead during the worst of the COVID pandemic, trading for a little over $6/share. It’s now over $23, nearly making up the ground lost over the last five years. Management has even brought back its dividend.Macy’s may be a full-price retailer, but the stock sells at off-price. We’re talking a price-to-earnings ratio of under 5, a dividend yielding 2.72%, and a market cap of $6.3 billion which is just one-quarter of last year’s sales. Meanwhile, visits to department stores are surging, according to Placer.ai. There are strong indications many of these shoppers are heading to Macy’s. It may just be post-COVID nostalgia, but it’s an opportunity.Macy’s has begun opening small stores outside traditional malls. The stores, called Market by Macy’s, even have a doppelganger under the chain’s other store label, Bloomingdale’s. Macy’s is also downsizing some of the existing stores and using the space as fulfillment centers for online orders. (It’s doing what Target is doing, only using real estate it already controls.) After years of effort, Macy’s now has 0.9% of the U.S. e-commerce market, more than the long-standing e-commerce brand Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY).Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIn all my years covering finance, few stocks have intrigued me as much as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG). It’s a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that, when malls began dying in the last decade, became its own landlord. Working with privately held Authentic Brands, which first monetized dead celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, then moved into the business of live ones like Shaquille O’Neal, it began buying its tenants. Simon began with Aeropostale. It now owns Forever 21. It owns Brooks Brothers and even JCPenney. Simon and Authentic buy brands in bankruptcy, using money from partners like Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), then sell the brand online and offline. What Simon can’t sell at full retail it moves to its own outlet centers. By getting into these deals, Simon was able to collect 90% of its rents during the worst of the pandemic. This also lets it play hardball when other tenants threatened to go under because it knew the value of its brands.While Simon doesn’t deliver capital gains, the stock is down over 26% in 2022, its REIT structure means it always hands investors back its profits. Over the last year that has meant $7.20 in dividends for stock that currently trades at around $118/share, a yield of over 6%. Where the real estate value of its malls has fallen, it can redevelop the land for long-term capital gains. The last decade has given malls a bad odor, but at least for this Christmas, that may be the smell of nostalgia. Simon’s moves have made it a popular choice for REIT investors but it is also, now, a retail bellwether.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in COST, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL.

(NYSE:HCA)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/many-still-looking-away-hca-140013050.html,1670162413,STORY,['HCA'],"[HCA Healthcare, Inc.'s (NYSE:HCA) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 12.6x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 15x and even P/E's above 30x are quite common. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.HCA Healthcare hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. See our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on HCA Healthcare.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?HCA Healthcare's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 9.0%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 86% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.5% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.1% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's peculiar that HCA Healthcare's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.Story continuesThe Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that HCA Healthcare currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. It appears some are indeed anticipating earnings instability, because these conditions should normally provide more support to the share price.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare   (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of HCA Healthcare's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

43,aba5bbe4-30da-3774-8862-9244ecf19b08,SLB,2022-12-05,We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/underlying-return-capital-trends-schlumberger-120156915.html,1670241716,STORY,['SLB'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Schlumberger:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$44b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 11%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Energy Services industry average of 7.0% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceIn the above chart we have measured Schlumberger's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Schlumberger here  for free.The Trend Of ROCESchlumberger has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 165%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. In regards to capital employed, Schlumberger appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 46% less capital to run its operation. Schlumberger may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn the end, Schlumberger has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. And given the stock has remained rather flat over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here if other metrics are strong. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.Like most companies, Schlumberger does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The cost of ignoring digital assets is high, it said.The development of blockchains that are smart contract-enabled and applications with real-world use has accelerated this year, the report said. Speculative trading may be widespread, but it's the “underlying blockchain technology driving this speculation that could be revolutionary.”Bank of America says “retail and institutional disengagement” could further pressure crypto prices, but notes that digital asset prices fell 22% between Nov. 2 and Nov. 10 before rising 6% through Nov. 25, which shows that investors may be moving on and are focused on blockchain technology’s long-term disruption potential.Read more: Bernstein: Crypto User Activity Is Moving On-Chain Following FTX’s Collapse]"

It has long been stuck on the drawing board, partly due to a battle over how big a share of the project's gold output would go to the PNG government.""Our teams have made significant progress in recent weeks and months to find a balance. With continuing goodwill on both sides, we anticipate a positive outcome will be reached,"" Newcrest Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas told the conference.The country is also locked in talks for a special mining lease to restart the Porgera gold mine, which has been shut for more than two and a half years, following an agreement reached last year with co-owners Barrick Gold Corp and China's Zijin Mining Group.""We understand you are not a charity but please take my people with you,"" Marape said at the conference, referring to companies looking to develop resource projects.Marape has been pressing for PNG to receive a bigger share of the benefits from mining and energy projects since he first became prime minister in 2019, and so far has succeeded in renegotiating deals with energy giants ExxonMobil Corp and TotalEnergies on their gas projects.Story continuesHe highlighted the country's proximity to resource-hungry Asian nations as an advantage for its mining and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The biggest single foreign investment in the country is the PNG LNG project, run by Exxon.""Last year when I visited China I was able to sell 3 million metric tonnes of gas. Papua New Guinea is using its bilateral network and multilateral networks to trade and can find markets,"" Marape said.The next major gas development awaiting a final investment decision is the Papua LNG project. TotalEnergies has said it aims to decide whether to go ahead with the project around the end of 2023.($1 = 3.6166 kina) (Reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Editing by Diane Craft and Kenneth Maxwell)]"

But uncertainty over the path of U.S. inflation, as well as the Fed’s terminal rate, is still expected to spur volatility in the market.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,800.10 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,813.40 an ounce, with both instruments trading at a near four-month high.Other precious metals were buoyed by bets on a less hawkish Fed. Platinum futures rose 0.6%, while silver futures added 0.9%. Precious metal markets logged deep losses this year as rising U.S. interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.This cost gold its safe haven status, and has seen the yellow metal trade more in line with traditional risk-driven assets this year.Sentiment in recent sessions was also supported by more Chinese cities relaxing anti-COVID measures over the weekend. Economic hubs including Beijing and Shanghai both relaxed some movement and testing measures, as the government sought to placate a wave of unprecedented protests against its strict zero-COVID policy.Reuters also reported that the government is gearing up to announce a nationwide easing of restrictions in the coming weeks.Industrial metals rose sharply on the prospect of a broader Chinese reopening, given that the country is one of the biggest commodity importers in the world.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.4% to $3.8718 a pound after rallying more than 6% last week.

Take a look at wheat futures. You will see a year-to-date here-- wheat futures relatively flat for the year. Oat futures are down 47% year-to-date. Even coffee futures are lower year-to-date, down 27%.So what is happening here? Because people are not seeing these lower prices in commodities translate to their grocery bills. You've got food inflation that is up roughly 12% year-over-year. Well, food producers, they're hesitant to lower their prices because of uncertainty when it comes to grain-- often, that output, grains are planted for the following year.So there's been a lot of turmoil with the situation with Ukraine. Also, the energy prices-- those are still relatively high, even though they have come off their highs. But energy is a big factor when it comes to food, especially when you're talking about farmers planting.They use diesel, and diesel has not come off its prices as much as gasoline has from their highs from earlier this year. Farmers use diesel, and also transportation is in diesel as well. So a lot of this takes about 3 to six months to translate into grocery bills.I did speak to a produce producer who was telling me that the prices at shipping points, those are down. But that doesn't reflect on the wholesale prices or supermarket prices also, because that takes time. There's a lag there as well, because you also have inventory at supermarkets that you need to clear out first before you bring in those other products, guys.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2022.The surprises seen in the Russia-Ukraine war theater forced military and defense experts to study modern warfighting and its changing dynamics with more depth. The war has shown that even the most powerful militaries, despite their huge numbers and technological advancements, can fail to perform against significantly weaker opponents due to a variety of reasons.Having one of the most powerful militaries in the world, Russia invaded Ukraine with ambitious goals, but soon started to fail and this performance surprised even the most famous think tanks. According to Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, the Ukraine war has underlined several major weaknesses of the Russian army. For example, the offensive and its subsequent failures show that the Russian military commanders continue to execute the last received instructions despite their failure until and unless the orders are countermanded.  The report also says the Ukraine war has shown that the Russian military is “culturally” vulnerable to deception. The institute believes so for three reasons. First, it says the Russian military develops a “systemic confirmation bias” because of its tendency to believe any information received as true unless there is contradictory information. The second reason is the inability of the Russian military commanders to openly report failures. Third, the report says the Russian systems are largely designed around single missions.Chinese Military PowerHowever, the United States military commanders have more to worry about China than Russia. The US can no longer ignore this ever-evolving threat as the Asian superpower has swiftly increased its air and naval power along with its technological might. RAND Corporation did threat modeling by comparing different aspects of military power of US and China. According to RAND’s report, more than two decades ago, China had obsolete Russian SA-2 missiles (with a range of roughly 35 km). Today, its missile technology is equipped to punish the enemy severely, with a range of 200 km. The report also adds that the Chinese integrated air defense system (IADS) has become a “formidable obstacle” for the US military. However, the US now has an advantage with stealth aircraft and new SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) aircraft.Story continuesIn terms of air superiority, the RAND report said that while the US still has an advantage over China, thanks to its fifth-generation aircraft, including the F-22 and F-35, today, if the Chinese air force starts a campaign in the Western Pacific region, the US would need “several hundred percent” more power to maintain its superiority than it needed in 1996.LEE SNIDER PHOTO IMAGES/Shutterstock.comHowever, for now, the US remains the most powerful military in the world. The Russian war and China's increasingly aggressive posture in the Pacific is increasing its anxiety and thus forcing it to boost its defense budget, thereby helping major defense companies. Countries in Europe have also started increasing their defense spending as they become more aware of the threat posed by Russia.All of this increased spending is incredibly beneficial to the biggest defense companies in the world. Some of the major companies expected to report soaring revenues amid this backdrop include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).To rank the countries with the most powerful militaries in the world in 2022, we considered their total military spending. Since modern warfare is highly reliant of naval and air power, our ranking criteria assigned 50% weightage to military spend, 30% to total number of fighter jets and 20% to total number of submarines.25. QatarTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 11,593Total number of fighter jets: 40Total number of submarines: 0Qatar was recently isolated by other Gulf countries, who only ended a three-year blockade in 2021.

IranTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 24,589Total number of fighter jets: 197Total number of submarines: 19Iran has always spent a lot on its defense due to its many conflicts which has resulted in several sanctions on the nation.

It is supported by the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone.FUJCON 2023 is expected to attract participants from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. They will include leading oil and bunker producers, traders, oil majors, national oil companies, shipowners and operators, managers, brokers, charterers, terminal operators, refiners, classification societies, shipping consultants and digital technologists, as well as banks and exchanges, legal firms, regulators, testing laboratories, renewable energy players, and other supply/service companies.This year's FUJCON 2023 theme is The Maritime Energy Transition and Future Fuels and the Forum will explore the energy transition and carbon reduction requirements that are forcing a paradigm shift in the maritime industry. It will examine market developments and Fujairah's future fuel options from the supply, operational, environmental and economic perspectives, as well as the possible technologies, investments, delivery infrastructure and industry collaboration needed to uncover new low-carbon maritime solutions and achieve sustainability goals.Dr Mohammed Saeed Al Kindi, Chairman of the FUJCON Steering Committee, said: ""Against the backdrop of Fujairah, which is recognised as a global hub for bunkering, oil storage, and crude and petroleum products supply, FUJCON 2023 will provide an exciting opportunity for key players in the bunkering and maritime industries to come together for both critical discussions and the Forum's networking opportunities.

The cost of ignoring digital assets is high, it said.The development of blockchains that are smart contract-enabled and applications with real-world use has accelerated this year, the report said. Speculative trading may be widespread, but it's the “underlying blockchain technology driving this speculation that could be revolutionary.”Bank of America says “retail and institutional disengagement” could further pressure crypto prices, but notes that digital asset prices fell 22% between Nov. 2 and Nov. 10 before rising 6% through Nov. 25, which shows that investors may be moving on and are focused on blockchain technology’s long-term disruption potential.Read more: Bernstein: Crypto User Activity Is Moving On-Chain Following FTX’s Collapse]"

It has long been stuck on the drawing board, partly due to a battle over how big a share of the project's gold output would go to the PNG government.""Our teams have made significant progress in recent weeks and months to find a balance. With continuing goodwill on both sides, we anticipate a positive outcome will be reached,"" Newcrest Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas told the conference.The country is also locked in talks for a special mining lease to restart the Porgera gold mine, which has been shut for more than two and a half years, following an agreement reached last year with co-owners Barrick Gold Corp and China's Zijin Mining Group.""We understand you are not a charity but please take my people with you,"" Marape said at the conference, referring to companies looking to develop resource projects.Marape has been pressing for PNG to receive a bigger share of the benefits from mining and energy projects since he first became prime minister in 2019, and so far has succeeded in renegotiating deals with energy giants ExxonMobil Corp and TotalEnergies on their gas projects.Story continuesHe highlighted the country's proximity to resource-hungry Asian nations as an advantage for its mining and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The biggest single foreign investment in the country is the PNG LNG project, run by Exxon.""Last year when I visited China I was able to sell 3 million metric tonnes of gas. Papua New Guinea is using its bilateral network and multilateral networks to trade and can find markets,"" Marape said.The next major gas development awaiting a final investment decision is the Papua LNG project. TotalEnergies has said it aims to decide whether to go ahead with the project around the end of 2023.($1 = 3.6166 kina) (Reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Editing by Diane Craft and Kenneth Maxwell)]"

But uncertainty over the path of U.S. inflation, as well as the Fed’s terminal rate, is still expected to spur volatility in the market.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,800.10 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,813.40 an ounce, with both instruments trading at a near four-month high.Other precious metals were buoyed by bets on a less hawkish Fed. Platinum futures rose 0.6%, while silver futures added 0.9%. Precious metal markets logged deep losses this year as rising U.S. interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.This cost gold its safe haven status, and has seen the yellow metal trade more in line with traditional risk-driven assets this year.Sentiment in recent sessions was also supported by more Chinese cities relaxing anti-COVID measures over the weekend. Economic hubs including Beijing and Shanghai both relaxed some movement and testing measures, as the government sought to placate a wave of unprecedented protests against its strict zero-COVID policy.Reuters also reported that the government is gearing up to announce a nationwide easing of restrictions in the coming weeks.Industrial metals rose sharply on the prospect of a broader Chinese reopening, given that the country is one of the biggest commodity importers in the world.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.4% to $3.8718 a pound after rallying more than 6% last week.

Take a look at wheat futures. You will see a year-to-date here-- wheat futures relatively flat for the year. Oat futures are down 47% year-to-date. Even coffee futures are lower year-to-date, down 27%.So what is happening here? Because people are not seeing these lower prices in commodities translate to their grocery bills. You've got food inflation that is up roughly 12% year-over-year. Well, food producers, they're hesitant to lower their prices because of uncertainty when it comes to grain-- often, that output, grains are planted for the following year.So there's been a lot of turmoil with the situation with Ukraine. Also, the energy prices-- those are still relatively high, even though they have come off their highs. But energy is a big factor when it comes to food, especially when you're talking about farmers planting.They use diesel, and diesel has not come off its prices as much as gasoline has from their highs from earlier this year. Farmers use diesel, and also transportation is in diesel as well. So a lot of this takes about 3 to six months to translate into grocery bills.I did speak to a produce producer who was telling me that the prices at shipping points, those are down. But that doesn't reflect on the wholesale prices or supermarket prices also, because that takes time. There's a lag there as well, because you also have inventory at supermarkets that you need to clear out first before you bring in those other products, guys.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2022.The surprises seen in the Russia-Ukraine war theater forced military and defense experts to study modern warfighting and its changing dynamics with more depth. The war has shown that even the most powerful militaries, despite their huge numbers and technological advancements, can fail to perform against significantly weaker opponents due to a variety of reasons.Having one of the most powerful militaries in the world, Russia invaded Ukraine with ambitious goals, but soon started to fail and this performance surprised even the most famous think tanks. According to Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, the Ukraine war has underlined several major weaknesses of the Russian army. For example, the offensive and its subsequent failures show that the Russian military commanders continue to execute the last received instructions despite their failure until and unless the orders are countermanded.  The report also says the Ukraine war has shown that the Russian military is “culturally” vulnerable to deception. The institute believes so for three reasons. First, it says the Russian military develops a “systemic confirmation bias” because of its tendency to believe any information received as true unless there is contradictory information. The second reason is the inability of the Russian military commanders to openly report failures. Third, the report says the Russian systems are largely designed around single missions.Chinese Military PowerHowever, the United States military commanders have more to worry about China than Russia. The US can no longer ignore this ever-evolving threat as the Asian superpower has swiftly increased its air and naval power along with its technological might. RAND Corporation did threat modeling by comparing different aspects of military power of US and China. According to RAND’s report, more than two decades ago, China had obsolete Russian SA-2 missiles (with a range of roughly 35 km). Today, its missile technology is equipped to punish the enemy severely, with a range of 200 km. The report also adds that the Chinese integrated air defense system (IADS) has become a “formidable obstacle” for the US military. However, the US now has an advantage with stealth aircraft and new SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) aircraft.Story continuesIn terms of air superiority, the RAND report said that while the US still has an advantage over China, thanks to its fifth-generation aircraft, including the F-22 and F-35, today, if the Chinese air force starts a campaign in the Western Pacific region, the US would need “several hundred percent” more power to maintain its superiority than it needed in 1996.LEE SNIDER PHOTO IMAGES/Shutterstock.comHowever, for now, the US remains the most powerful military in the world. The Russian war and China's increasingly aggressive posture in the Pacific is increasing its anxiety and thus forcing it to boost its defense budget, thereby helping major defense companies. Countries in Europe have also started increasing their defense spending as they become more aware of the threat posed by Russia.All of this increased spending is incredibly beneficial to the biggest defense companies in the world. Some of the major companies expected to report soaring revenues amid this backdrop include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).To rank the countries with the most powerful militaries in the world in 2022, we considered their total military spending. Since modern warfare is highly reliant of naval and air power, our ranking criteria assigned 50% weightage to military spend, 30% to total number of fighter jets and 20% to total number of submarines.25.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.Since the start of 2022, the S&amp;P 500 Index has observed a decline of 15.5%. The index also remained in the bear market territory from mid-June to mid-July and from the third week of September to early November. As investors return after the Thanksgiving holiday, they are preparing themselves for the final interest rate hike of the year in December. The majority consensus is that the benchmark interest rate will be increased by 50 basis points (bps) to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% when the members of the Federal Reserve meet on December 14. The current benchmark interest rates are already at their highest level since 2008. The Fed has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 bps on the past four consecutive occasions. The raging inflation and increasing interest rates have dampened the sentiments of investors across Wall Street. Experts are anticipating the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance till the inflation rate falls below the 4% level. This will still be two percentage points (ppts) higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Inflation for October 2022 was recorded at 7.7%, which reflected a decline for the fourth consecutive month and is at its lowest level since January 2022. However, inflation is currently hovering at a four-decade high.Goldman Sachs anticipates that the bear market that has hit stocks this year could continue in 2023 as well. The New York-based diversified financial services firm believes that the recent recovery in stocks is just a knee-jerk reaction to the heavy losses that investors have faced this year. There are still three factors that need to materialize for the stocks to find a bottom. The first factor is that the valuations need to be more depressed to be in line with recessionary markets. Secondly, the business cycle should reach a true bottom in terms of economic deterioration before actual recovery occurs. Finally, the benchmark interest rates need to reach a peak. This has not been the case till now, as experts believe that the benchmark interest rate will reach a peak of 5.5% in 2023 before cuts start to take place in 2024. In such circumstances, investors are on the lookout for the best bear market stocks to shield their savings. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests.

Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare company that offers a retail pharmacy network, health insurance services, and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). The company is at the ninth position on our list of the best bear market stocks to buy now.On November 23, Erin Wright at Morgan Stanley assigned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $119 along with an Overweight rating. The analyst has an overall bullish outlook on the company’s long-term earnings prospects. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) offers an annual payout of $2.20, translating into a forward dividend yield of 2.18% as of November 30. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has also revealed that it is looking for acquisition opportunities that could advance the company’s broader strategy and increase its presence in key areas.Vltava Fund shared its stance on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Bentonville, Arkansas-based company that is considered the biggest retailer in the world through its hypermarkets, supercenters, and supermarkets.In an update issued to investors on November 16, Robert Ohmes at Bank of America highlighted that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is gaining market share in the middle of challenging and uncertain economic circumstances. The analyst anticipates the company to gain more market share in the grocery segment as it offers strong value through its everyday low prices (EDLP) strategy. The analyst increased the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)  from $155 to $165 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock following the strong Q3 2022 earnings results.Here’s what Leaven Partners said about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a Chicago, Illinois-based pharmaceutical company that has invested over $50 billion in research and development since its spin-off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013.Trung Huynh at Credit Suisse initiated coverage on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) on November 17 with an Outperform rating and a target price of $170. The analyst termed the company as one of the two best ideas in the US large-cap pharmaceutical industry. Huynh thinks that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a strong drug pipeline, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in. Furthermore, the analyst thinks the guidance of 35% to 55% erosion in sales for Humira in 2023 following the expected launch of nine biosimilars is “too conservative.” AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.74% as of November 30.Baron Funds shared its bullish outlook on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Jersey-based diversified healthcare company that is involved in consumer health, medical technology, and pharmaceutical products.The company is working on spinning off its consumer health segment as a separate publicly listed entity to focus on its core medical technology and pharmaceutical businesses. Experts anticipate the spin-off will improve the valuation of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Furthermore, the company intends to reach revenue of $60 billion from its pharmaceutical business by 2025. The segment contributed a total revenue of $52.08 billion in 2021. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has provided the impetus to the medical technology division through the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) for $16.6 billion.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions. This leaves JNJ with about 48 cents on the dollar in profit…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

If you want to read about some more stocks that Cramer and Dalio are bullish on, go directly to Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks.Ray Dalio, the chief of Bridgewater Associates, is one of the most respected hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Only stocks that Jim Cramer has also been bullish on in the past few weeks were selected. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These Stocks10. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. On November 29, McDonald’s said that its stores in Kazakhstan were forced to temporarily close this month after cutting ties with Russian companies and running out of supplies. Latest data shows that Dalio owned more than 2.1 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $487 million. On September 1, Jim Cramer placed the company among a group of dividend-paying stocks that he was bullish on for the coming months. He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On October 12, Costco declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The forwarded yield was 0.77%.

Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company was building everywhere, including big projects in China, and did not want to raise their membership fees because it was part of a larger plan by the retail giant to pressure the competition.   On November 29, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock and lowered the price target to $578 from $581. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide.

(NASDAQ:PEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also in the stable and predictable cash flow camp, though with a very different business model, global food and beverage company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reported very strong organic growth in the first quarter, driven by healthy price/mix, and raised revenue guidance, while holding EPS guidance. Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 30% in three years, versus a market return of about 34%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 25% in the last year.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for Medtronic While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Medtronic saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 2.9% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 11% annual reduction in the share price. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Medtronic's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Medtronic, it has a TSR of -24% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Medtronic shareholders are down 23% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 14%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.

74,b2f6fa85-df25-384b-b065-a6adf03e87f3,CCI,2022-12-05,Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-inc-nyse-cci-140052605.html,1670162452,STORY,['CCI'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:21% = US$1.6b ÷ US$7.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.Does Crown Castle Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Crown Castle has a better ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Crown Castle by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCrown Castle's Debt And Its 21% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Crown Castle, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.77. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Crown Castle may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

RSG, Clean Harbors, Inc. CLH and Core &amp; Main, Inc. CNM.Industry: Waste RemovalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2024802/3-waste-removal-services-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-challengesThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry stands to benefit from the gradual resumption of business activities and reopening of the economy, which have led to increased waste production from industrial and commercial sectors. Government initiatives for sustainable waste management, increasing environmental awareness, rising population, rapid industrialization and urbanization and growing adoption of advanced waste collection solutions are the other positives.Republic Services, Inc., Clean Harbors, Inc. and Core &amp; Main, Inc. are some stocks likely to gain from the abovementioned factors.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry comprises companies engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment, disposal, inspection and regulation of any form of waste. The companies serve residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in the United States and internationally.Some industry participants provide non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, disposal, and energy services for small-container, large-container, municipal and residential, and energy services customers in the United States and Puerto Rico, while others provide waste management environmental services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers in North America. Some industry players operate as environmental infrastructure and solutions companies, providing water handling and recycling solutions.What's Shaping the Future of Waste Removal Services Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment: The industry is mature, with growth coming from volume and price increases. Income has grown steadily over the past few years, enabling most industry players to pursue acquisitions and other investments.Story continuesThe Uptick in Economic Activities Bodes Well: With the reopening of the economy and the resumption of business activities, waste generation is bound to increase, especially in industrial and commercial sectors. Despite the decline in COVID-19 cases, proper disposal of medical waste will always remain an utmost priority to curb the spread of infection.Increases in population, industrialization and urbanization should remain the key drivers of the industry as these lead to a significant rise in garbage and recycling. Also, the use of advanced collection and recycling solutions is expected to pick up pace. This should enhance business opportunities for waste management companies.Government initiatives as well as stringent rules and regulations to advance sustainable waste management mechanisms and put a check on illegal dumping are also expected to boost the industry.High Operating Costs a Woe: Given that waste management is both a time-consuming and complex process, it requires higher capital and operating costs to manage waste collection vehicles, bins, and processing equipment along with a huge number of workers. Such high operational expenses are likely to keep the bottom line of the companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #138. This rank places it in the bottom 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the cloudy prospects, we present a few stocks that investors can buy or retain given their sturdy potential. But before that let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and its current valuation.Industry's PerformanceThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 6.3% over this period compared with 35.6% decline of the broader sector and 11.7% decline of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is commonly used for valuing waste removal services stocks because of their high debt levels, the industry is currently trading at 13.99X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.4X and the sector’s 24.11X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 14.82X, as low as 8.57X and at the median of 11.88X.3 Waste Removal Services Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnCore &amp; Main: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Missouri-based company distributes water, wastewater, storm drainage, and fire protection products and related services to municipalities, private water companies, and professional contractors in the municipal, non-residential, and residential end markets in the United States.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Core &amp; Main has been benefiting from solid demand across each of its end markets, backed by continued growth in municipal water infrastructure spending, growth in land and development due to continued housing demand, and recovery in the non-residential construction market.Despite the ongoing inflationary trends across many of its product lines due to supply chain constraints and product availability challenges, the company kept floating through its reliable products and services. The company’s active M&amp;A strategy has been helping it expand into new geographies, access new product lines, consolidate existing market positions and add key talent. In addition, higher net sales and cost-control initiatives will likely drive margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNM 2022 EPS has moved up 15.5% in the past 90 days.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Walmart Inc. WMT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top 4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Enhance Your Portfolio in DecemberWe are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.U.S. stock markets are witnessing a solid rally since mid-October, which is likely to extend till the year-end. We have selected four Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to gain from the ongoing rally. These stocks are — Caterpillar Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Walmart Inc.Dow Suffers the LeastYear to date, the three large-cap-centric stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.4%, 14.5% and 26.6% respectively. On Dec 1, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index of Wall Street — technically exited bear territory after closing more than 20% higher over its recent low posted on Sep 30.The primary concern of the U.S. economy is soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has already hiked interest rates sharply by 3.75% year to date.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks rather than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for December and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merck has been benefiting from strong sales of  Keytruda, Lynparza and Bridion. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver of MRK.Animal health and vaccine products are the core growth drivers. Merck’s new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio, will be a key top-line driver in 2022. MRK boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Caterpillar’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply-chain snarls and cost pressures.We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries space is expected to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 27.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2% over the last 30 days.Walmart has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships. WMT’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in the grocery segment.Walmart has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.6% for next year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.9% over the last 30 days.UnitedHealth has been benefiting from a strong market position and an attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.UNH’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UnitedHealth’s government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent capital deployment through share buybacks and dividends. UnitedHealth has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.7% for the current year.

81,e8d72550-5232-327f-b8e0-1fd91915ac73,BA,2022-12-05,25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-powerful-militaries-world-205638891.html,1670187398,STORY,"['NOC', 'BA', 'LMT', 'GD']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 most powerful militaries in the world in 2022. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2022.The surprises seen in the Russia-Ukraine war theater forced military and defense experts to study modern warfighting and its changing dynamics with more depth. The war has shown that even the most powerful militaries, despite their huge numbers and technological advancements, can fail to perform against significantly weaker opponents due to a variety of reasons.Having one of the most powerful militaries in the world, Russia invaded Ukraine with ambitious goals, but soon started to fail and this performance surprised even the most famous think tanks. According to Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, the Ukraine war has underlined several major weaknesses of the Russian army. For example, the offensive and its subsequent failures show that the Russian military commanders continue to execute the last received instructions despite their failure until and unless the orders are countermanded.  The report also says the Ukraine war has shown that the Russian military is “culturally” vulnerable to deception. The institute believes so for three reasons. First, it says the Russian military develops a “systemic confirmation bias” because of its tendency to believe any information received as true unless there is contradictory information. The second reason is the inability of the Russian military commanders to openly report failures. Third, the report says the Russian systems are largely designed around single missions.Chinese Military PowerHowever, the United States military commanders have more to worry about China than Russia. The US can no longer ignore this ever-evolving threat as the Asian superpower has swiftly increased its air and naval power along with its technological might. RAND Corporation did threat modeling by comparing different aspects of military power of US and China. According to RAND’s report, more than two decades ago, China had obsolete Russian SA-2 missiles (with a range of roughly 35 km). Today, its missile technology is equipped to punish the enemy severely, with a range of 200 km. The report also adds that the Chinese integrated air defense system (IADS) has become a “formidable obstacle” for the US military. However, the US now has an advantage with stealth aircraft and new SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) aircraft.Story continuesIn terms of air superiority, the RAND report said that while the US still has an advantage over China, thanks to its fifth-generation aircraft, including the F-22 and F-35, today, if the Chinese air force starts a campaign in the Western Pacific region, the US would need “several hundred percent” more power to maintain its superiority than it needed in 1996.LEE SNIDER PHOTO IMAGES/Shutterstock.comHowever, for now, the US remains the most powerful military in the world. The Russian war and China's increasingly aggressive posture in the Pacific is increasing its anxiety and thus forcing it to boost its defense budget, thereby helping major defense companies. Countries in Europe have also started increasing their defense spending as they become more aware of the threat posed by Russia.All of this increased spending is incredibly beneficial to the biggest defense companies in the world. Some of the major companies expected to report soaring revenues amid this backdrop include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).To rank the countries with the most powerful militaries in the world in 2022, we considered their total military spending. Since modern warfare is highly reliant of naval and air power, our ranking criteria assigned 50% weightage to military spend, 30% to total number of fighter jets and 20% to total number of submarines.25. QatarTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 11,593Total number of fighter jets: 40Total number of submarines: 0Qatar was recently isolated by other Gulf countries, who only ended a three-year blockade in 2021. Despite diplomatic pressure from the Gulf countries, Qatar actually emerged stronger and more autonomous.24. ColombiaTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 10,180Total number of fighter jets: 17Total number of submarines: 11With one of the highest military spend in Latin America, Colombia earned its spot in the list of the most powerful militaries in the world.23. SingaporeTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 11,115Total number of fighter jets: 100Total number of submarines: 5Singapore has reserved a large portion of its total budget for its military which is why it has one of the most advanced militaries in the region.22. PolandTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 13,710Total number of fighter jets: 91Total number of submarines: 1Historically, Poland has faced huge threats from Russia and Germany. Its conflict with Germany was resolved in the second World War, but the Russian threat is still making the nation anxious, causing it to spend heavily on defense and also seek US and NATO support.21. NetherlandsTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 13,752Total number of fighter jets: 40Total number of submarines: 4In October 2022, the Dutch government announced that it would spend up to $3.5 billion on military procurement.20. BrazilTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 19,187Total number of fighter jets: 42Total number of submarines: 7One of the biggest economies in the world, Brazil has continued to improve its military spend, mainly in a bid to increase its presence on the global stage.19. SpainTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 19,544Total number of fighter jets: 140Total number of submarines: 2In 2022, Spain approved an increase in military spend by more than $1 billion to increase the defense budget to 2% of its GDP.18.

(NYSE:PWR)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-quanta-services-135301338.html,1670161981,STORY,['PWR'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Quanta Services The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$844.0mUS$933.3mUS$1.19bUS$1.30bUS$1.37bUS$1.44bUS$1.49bUS$1.54bUS$1.59bUS$1.63bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.88%Est @ 4.71%Est @ 3.89%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$785US$806US$958US$967US$952US$926US$894US$859US$822US$784(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.8bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$23b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$153, the company appears about fair value at a 5.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Quanta Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.092. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Quanta Services, there are three important factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2022.The surprises seen in the Russia-Ukraine war theater forced military and defense experts to study modern warfighting and its changing dynamics with more depth. The war has shown that even the most powerful militaries, despite their huge numbers and technological advancements, can fail to perform against significantly weaker opponents due to a variety of reasons.Having one of the most powerful militaries in the world, Russia invaded Ukraine with ambitious goals, but soon started to fail and this performance surprised even the most famous think tanks. According to Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, the Ukraine war has underlined several major weaknesses of the Russian army. For example, the offensive and its subsequent failures show that the Russian military commanders continue to execute the last received instructions despite their failure until and unless the orders are countermanded.  The report also says the Ukraine war has shown that the Russian military is “culturally” vulnerable to deception. The institute believes so for three reasons. First, it says the Russian military develops a “systemic confirmation bias” because of its tendency to believe any information received as true unless there is contradictory information. The second reason is the inability of the Russian military commanders to openly report failures. Third, the report says the Russian systems are largely designed around single missions.Chinese Military PowerHowever, the United States military commanders have more to worry about China than Russia. The US can no longer ignore this ever-evolving threat as the Asian superpower has swiftly increased its air and naval power along with its technological might. RAND Corporation did threat modeling by comparing different aspects of military power of US and China. According to RAND’s report, more than two decades ago, China had obsolete Russian SA-2 missiles (with a range of roughly 35 km). Today, its missile technology is equipped to punish the enemy severely, with a range of 200 km. The report also adds that the Chinese integrated air defense system (IADS) has become a “formidable obstacle” for the US military. However, the US now has an advantage with stealth aircraft and new SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) aircraft.Story continuesIn terms of air superiority, the RAND report said that while the US still has an advantage over China, thanks to its fifth-generation aircraft, including the F-22 and F-35, today, if the Chinese air force starts a campaign in the Western Pacific region, the US would need “several hundred percent” more power to maintain its superiority than it needed in 1996.LEE SNIDER PHOTO IMAGES/Shutterstock.comHowever, for now, the US remains the most powerful military in the world. The Russian war and China's increasingly aggressive posture in the Pacific is increasing its anxiety and thus forcing it to boost its defense budget, thereby helping major defense companies. Countries in Europe have also started increasing their defense spending as they become more aware of the threat posed by Russia.All of this increased spending is incredibly beneficial to the biggest defense companies in the world. Some of the major companies expected to report soaring revenues amid this backdrop include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).To rank the countries with the most powerful militaries in the world in 2022, we considered their total military spending. Since modern warfare is highly reliant of naval and air power, our ranking criteria assigned 50% weightage to military spend, 30% to total number of fighter jets and 20% to total number of submarines.25. QatarTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 11,593Total number of fighter jets: 40Total number of submarines: 0Qatar was recently isolated by other Gulf countries, who only ended a three-year blockade in 2021.

SingaporeTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 11,115Total number of fighter jets: 100Total number of submarines: 5Singapore has reserved a large portion of its total budget for its military which is why it has one of the most advanced militaries in the region.22. PolandTotal military spend by the country (in millions): 13,710Total number of fighter jets: 91Total number of submarines: 1Historically, Poland has faced huge threats from Russia and Germany. Its conflict with Germany was resolved in the second World War, but the Russian threat is still making the nation anxious, causing it to spend heavily on defense and also seek US and NATO support.21.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So while NIKE (NYSE:NKE) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on NIKE is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$6.2b ÷ (US$41b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).Therefore, NIKE has an ROCE of 21%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for NIKE roceIn the above chart we have measured NIKE's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NIKE here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at NIKE doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 26%. However it looks like NIKE might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Bottom LineIn summary, NIKE is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 92% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesIf you're still interested in NIKE it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Richard Carucci, a director on the Board since 2009, will serve as Interim Chairman of the Board.Dorer’s appointment follows Steve Rendle’s decision to retire from his position as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The company has commenced a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer and has retained a leading executive search firm to support its evaluation of internal and external candidates.""The Board thanks Steve for his many contributions and leadership during his nearly six years as CEO and nearly 25 years with VF,"" said Dorer. ""Steve’s commitment to the business, passion for building strong brands and focus on culture have helped VF evolve our portfolio of strong active-lifestyle brands and establish VF as a purpose-led company. We wish Steve well in his future endeavors.""Dorer continued, ""VF has iconic brands in attractive growth categories, deep relationships with consumers and customers, and significant competitive advantages as a portfolio company. I look forward to working closely with the Board and VF’s Executive Leadership Team to drive profitable growth across our portfolio while the Board identifies the right leader for the company’s next chapter.""Carucci said, ""We are fortunate to have Benno lead VF while the Board conducts a search for a permanent CEO.

""I depart with the deepest gratitude for the extremely talented and dedicated global team at VF. I remain as confident as ever in VF’s tremendous potential and look forward to watching the company’s continued success.""Story continuesFY23 Financial OutlookVF is revising its FY23 outlook largely to reflect the impact of weaker than anticipated consumer demand across its categories, primarily in North America, which is resulting in a more elevated than expected promotional environment as well as order cancellations in the wholesale channel to manage trade inventories. Also impacting the outlook, but to a lesser degree, are the higher than expected impacts from inflation on consumer discretionary spending in Europe and ongoing COVID-19 related disruption in China.VF now expects total revenue growth in the second half of FY23 to be modestly lower than previously outlined, with revenue for the full year expected to increase 3% to 4% in constant dollars (excluding the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars), compared to the previous guidance of up 5% to 6% in constant dollars. The promotional environment, primarily in North America, and SG&amp;A deleverage from lower volumes are expected to impact profitability in the near term. Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year is now expected to be $2.00 to $2.20, versus $3.18 in the prior year and compared to the previous outlook of $2.40 to $2.50. Adjusted amounts exclude transaction and deal related activities, costs related to specified strategic business decisions, noncash impairment charges, and a pension settlement charge.VF remains committed to its FY27 long-term targets and capital allocation priorities, as outlined during its recent Investor Day on September 28, 2022, and is focused on executing against its strategy in order to drive strong long-term shareholder value and on improving near-term performance.About Benno DorerBenno Dorer joined the VF Board in 2017 and has served as the Lead Independent Director since 2021.

89,4287ec5c-98f8-39d2-aa3f-db9436496337,WFC,2022-12-05,15 Most Capitalist Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-capitalist-companies-world-212921330.html,1670189361,STORY,"['GE', 'CVX', 'DVN', 'XOM', 'MMM', 'GEO', 'WFC-PD']","[In this article, we take a look at 15 most capitalist companies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the excesses of capitalism and go directly to 5 Most Capitalist Companies in the World. The unbridled capitalism that has gone around in countries like the US has created unprecedented levels of harm on a planetary scale. It has resulted in massive resource depletion, ecological degradation, global warming, wealth inequality and labor exploitation.The Capitalist Impact on the PlanetAn MIT study in 1972 used World3, a system-dynamics simulation with variables like population growth, food production, industrial output, pollution rate and resources, to predict that our business-as-usual approach was grievously unsustainable. The study further said that unsustainable capitalistic practices would likely result in collapse of global infrastructure somewhere in the mid-21st century unless measures were taken in time to transition to a more sustainable approach to growth. A new study, published in Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology, tested the World3 model with the data of the previous 38 years and vindicated it, concluding that we’re headed towards a societal collapse if we don't change our practices.Wealth Inequality and LaborApart from environmental damage, this form of capitalism has also resulted in income inequality. For instance, Bloomberg showed that while the wealth of the top 1% increased by 27% in 2021, the American middle-class saw its wealth decline by 26.6% in the same year.  Additionally, many companies are known for union-busting to maximize shareholder value and prefer that wages are determined by supply and demand. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership has declined from 20.1% in 1983 to 10.3% in 2021. This is reflected in another statistic from the Economic Policy Institute, which shows that productivity has gone up by 62.5%, while wages in comparison have only grown by 16% from the period 1979-2021.Story continuesAs population and education levels rise, more skill-oriented people are available for particular jobs. The competition becomes more intense, and so productivity grows exponentially relative to the linear wage-growth. This is where ESG investing comes in. ESG is an acronym for Environmental, Social and Governance. It is a set of standards that determine how ethical a corporation is environmentally, socially and in corporate governance. It helps socially and environmentally conscious investors to find and invest in companies that share their values, in practice. ESG and Corporate FinanceStern School of Business did a meta-analysis of a 1000 studies published on ESG and corporate financial performance between 2015-2020 and found a positive correlation between corporate ESG measures and financial performance (in metrics like Return on Assets and Return on Equity) for 58% of the studies. It also found that corporate investment in environmental sustainability not only had no negative effect on short-term financial performance but actually had a positive effect in the long-term. Another insight is that a good performance in ESG provides downside protection in times of social and/or economic crisis as well as improved risk management. Tech companies have some of the lowest ESG risks. For instance, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have ESG-risk scores of only 16.7 and 15.2 respectively, making them some of the most pro-ESG companies in the world.15 Most Capitalist Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology For our list of the 15 most capitalist companies in the world, we’ve selected companies with high ESG-risk scores from the top 25 corporations with the biggest market share. We’ve gathered ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a Morningstar firm that rates corporate sustainability. It defines ESG risk as the risk to a company's economic value from the lack of, or poor management of, ESG factors.  It calculates ESG-risk scores based on unmanaged risk to a company. Unmanaged risk is divided into unmanageable risk - risks that can't be managed by the company, and management gap - risks that can be managed by the company for ESG but aren't. Sustainalytics assign a quantitative ESG risk score between 0 and 50 to each company and based on that score, it groups them into any of the five risk categories; Negligible (0-10) Low (10-20), Medium (20-30), High (30-40), and Severe (40-50).15. The Geo Group, Inc (NYSE:GEO)ESG Risk Score: 31.7ESG-Risk: HighThe Geo Group, Inc. (NYSE:GEO) is a multinational real estate investment company that invests primarily in private prisons and mental health facilities in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia.

It has been subjected to several lawsuits, including a recent one by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who said that the case followed a multi-year investigation that showed that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) marketed products containing Polyfluoroalkyl and Perfluoroalkyl compounds for decades. The lawsuit alleged that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) knew that these compounds were carcinogenic, and were responsible for developmental defects in addition to cancer but continued selling them.12. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)ESG Risk Score: 34.5ESG-Risk: HighMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the biggest social media company in the world, with a user-base of roughly 3 billion people on their platforms - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ESG risk is ""High"" according to Sustainalytics.11. Hitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T)ESG Risk Score: 34.6ESG-Risk: HighHitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T) is a Japanese global conglomerate primarily involved in designing and manufacturing electronics for various industries like construction, defense and automotive. In November 2018, Hitachi Chemical, an arm of Hitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T), disclosed that it discovered over 30 products that are used in consumer electronics, and approximately 1,900 businesses that it supplies to, were affected by inspection problems that were pervasive across all of its factories in Japan.The issues were made public in late June in the same year when Hitachi acknowledged that it had fabricated data for 500 clients' industrial lead-acid batteries. Employees skipped inspections or used testing methods other than those agreed upon with clients. Some test results were also fabricated.10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)ESG Risk Score: 36.5ESG-Risk: HighExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil and hydrocarbon companies in the world. Its ESG-risk score is high, at 36.5. Exxon has one of the biggest carbon footprints in the world as far as corporations go. In 2019, the scope-3 emissions of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) amounted to 730 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. For perspective, this is how much Canada emits in a year.9. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)ESG Risk Score: 36.7ESG-Risk: HighDevon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is another energy corporation from the US. While the company has pledged net-zero emissions by 2050, these do not include its scope-3 emissions. In addition, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) hasn't laid out any particular details in its sustainability reports that show how it intends to achieve its net-zero goals. As per the Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has not worked to meet the indicators for capital allocation alignment for its long-term GHG reduction targets as of 2021.

The bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, which targets the original strain and the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants, is currently authorized as a booster dose for ages 5 years and older in the United States and the European Union (EU). Last month, a real-world study of more than 360,000 people in the U.S. found the updated bivalent boosters, including those of rival Moderna Inc, offered increased protection against new coronavirus subvariants in people who have received up to four doses of the older vaccine.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Robert Del Bene, sold US$445k worth of shares at a price of US$148 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$149). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 17% of Robert Del Bene's holding. Robert Del Bene was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 1.08k shares for US$135k. But they sold 4.60k shares for US$668k. Robert Del Bene sold a total of 4.60k shares over the year at an average price of US$145. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At International Business Machines Have Sold Stock RecentlyThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of International Business Machines shares over the last three months. In total, insider Robert Del Bene sold US$445k worth of shares in that time. On the flip side, Independent Director David Farr spent US$125k on purchasing shares. Generally this level of net selling might be considered a bit bearish.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. International Business Machines insiders own about US$106m worth of shares (which is 0.08% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The International Business Machines Insider Transactions Indicate?The stark truth for International Business Machines is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

93,f2bf3a67-9f96-3747-9124-7700af1cd1e8,IBM,2022-12-05,7 Tech Stocks to Take Seriously in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-tech-stocks-seriously-2023-115930832.html,1669982370,STORY,"['TSM', 'BIDU', 'IBM', 'JD', 'PYPL']","[Despite the challenges presented by the current economic downturn, there are still plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the tech sector’s future. 2022 has been nothing less than a nightmare for investors in tech stocks. However, in all likelihood, the stock market conditions will improve substantially in the coming year, pointing to a strong upside for tech stocks. Therefore, it’s an ideal time for investors to look for the best tech stock picks for 2023.However, it’s also important to avoid catching a falling knife. The current macroeconomic headwinds may impose pain in the short term, but they also present an opportunity for long-term investors to grab discounts. In most cases, companies print deep losses for a reason, but most tech stocks suffer from Wall Street’s overreaction. For long-term investors, these stocks offer a chance to gain exposure to some of the best tech businesses at an incredible discount. Having said that, here are seven top tech stock picks for 2023.SymbolCompanyPriceANETArista$139.78PYPLPayPal$78.53TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$82.68JDJD.com$55.85IMAXImax$16.78IBMInternational Business Machines$149.16BIDUBaidu$108.67InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArista (ANET)Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comArista (NYSE:ANET) is among the top cloud networking solutions providers benefiting from secular tailwinds in the cloud, data centers, and edge computing markets. The company has recently introduced numerous new, lucrative products, including its updated routing platform and encrypted data-transit offering. Moreover, its systems can handle multiple updates without any downtime. Additionally, it offers greater automation than its peers, giving it a major edge over its competition. Hence, its focus on innovation and superior customer service positions the company for continued success in the coming years.Impressively the firm expects an average sales growth of 20% from 2020 to 2025, with 25% revenue growth expected next year. Moreover, it expects its gross margins to reach over 61% to 64% over the long term. The strength in its business is driven by its robust enterprise business and cloud customer demand, which should remain strong for the foreseeable future.Story continuesPayPal (PYPL)Image of the PayPal logo on a smartphone next to a physical bitcoin token.Source: Primakov/shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the largest and most influential fintech businesses globally. It boasts a remarkably consistent business that’s generated more than 18% average growth in the past five years. With the global fintech space forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 16.9% until 2028, I expect PYPL stock to remain a no-brainer investment.Its solid execution has resulted in another stellar quarter for the firm. Transactions per active account during the third quarter soared over a record 13%. Its management is executing belt-tightening measures that have the firm on track to save $900 million annually. Moreover, it bought back a tremendous 10 million shares, returning $939 million to its shareholders this year. Despite its stellar performance, its stock is down over 50% for the year, which makes it a highly attractive bet at current prices.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in TaiwanSource: ToyW / ShutterstockIt doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand why big-money investors are wagering on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). As a leading semiconductor foundry, TSM has been at the forefront of the technology for years, giving it tremendous wiggle room to command higher prices. TSM’s market dominance also allows them to reinvest more into its business, perpetuating its competitive advantage.Due to the unfavorable semiconductor cycle, TSM stock has taken a major hammering at the stock market. However, the excess demand for its products has effectively insulted it from the crisis. This is evidenced by its robust sales growth this year, which is more than 20% higher than its historical 5-year average. Together, these factors make TSM an attractive investment for the long haul.JD.com (JD)JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JDSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese eCommerce specialist with superior fundamentals. It has posted double-digit growth margins in revenues and earnings. Recent results have been lackluster due to the issues with the broader economy and the Asian nation’s reopening troubles. Despite the unconducive conditions, the business has been resilient, beating earnings estimates over the past several quarters.With conditions set to improve substantially with the Chinese economy next year, analysts estimate a snapback in results. Analysts, on average, expect its sales to climb to $168.7 billion in 2023, up substantially from $145.4 billion this year. This represents over 15% growth from the prior-year period. Its stock price is down substantially this year, and based on its robust growth prospects is still a reasonably valued stock. Hence, it’s a great long-term investment that is in position for a strong comeback in the upcoming quarters.Imax (IMAX)the exterior of an Imax theaterSource: imageAllan / Shutterstock.comImax (NYSE:IMAX) is a cinema technology company providing an immersive big-screen experience with custom audio. It is a clear market leader in upmarket cinema technology and has a global reach across 75 countries. Its business has taken a hammering particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Previously, it was a profitable business with a clear upward trajectory. However, recent results have shown that it has turned a corner post-pandemic.Audiences are returning in droves to cinemas, and Amazon’s recent plans to spend $1 billion annually on theatrical movie release points to a hefty upside ahead. Though streaming content is on the rise, Amazon’s recent move suggests that there is still a sizeable growth runway for the sector. Therefore, Imax looks poised for continued success in the years ahead.International Business Machines (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is widely known as one of the largest information technology companies in the world. The company has a long history dating back to the early days of computing and has been a major player in the industry ever since. In recent years, IBM has been expanding its reach into more profitable markets, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Its acquisition of Red Hat, a leading open-source software provider, was a major step forward in developing its expertise in emerging technologies.Its positive results, of late, have been driven by growth in its software and consulting revenues that contributed to roughly 70% of its annual sales in the third quarter. The hybrid cloud business alone could grow by 18.4% from 2021 to 2030. As we advance, the firm is set to benefit from the growing digitization of enterprises and should capitalize on the rising demand for AI and hybrid cloud solutions.Baidu (BIDU)An Apollo self-driving car from Baidu drives around California.. BIDU stockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), also known as China’s Google, is one of the most underappreciated businesses in the tech space. With over a billion internet users in China, Baidu holds over an 80% market share in the Chinese search market and an even more dominant share in the mobile segment. Not only is Baidu a leading search engine provider, but it also has the fourth largest cloud business in China, with around 9-10% market share. Also, the internet giant has secured permits to provide driverless service in Beijing, positioning it as a first-mover in the massive untapped driverless AI sector.Given the company’s dominant market position in China’s search market and diversified business portfolio, Baidu presents significant growth prospects and profitability potential. Though it operates in a challenging economic environment, Baidu’s long-term bull case remains firmly intact. Its stock remains undervalued, providing investors with an attractive entry point.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

94,d8b1f5c9-0dae-319d-876b-cc3f2c81368a,GM,2022-12-05,7 EV Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-ev-stocks-hedge-funds-174244495.html,1669916564,STORY,"['NIO', 'RIVN', 'GM', 'TSLA', 'BYDDY']","[Though the electric vehicle industry may be struggling, certain EV stocks hedge funds are buying could offer hope for contrarians. To be sure, one of the sector exchange-traded funds Fidelity Electric Vehicles and Future Transportation ETF (BATS:FDRV) fell nearly 37% on a year-to-date basis. Therefore, investors do need to be cautious about engaging in this space.Nevertheless, there’s something to be said about trading with smart money. In particular, institutional investors such as high-profile hedge funds leverage tremendous resources and brain power. By logical deduction, retail investors can piggyback off this catalyst. It’s no guarantee, of course, but the EV stocks hedge funds are buying may outperform the competition.RIVNRivian Automotive$31.24LCIDLucid Group$9.81NIONio Inc.$12.32BYDDFBYD.$25.10ZEVLightning eMotors$0.66GMGeneral Motors$40.77TSLATesla$194.82InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRivian Automotive (RIVN)Rivian (RIVN) is new electric vehicle shown at the New York International Auto Show 2019, at the Jacob Javits Center. This was Press Preview Day One of NYIASSource: Miro Vrlik Photography / Shutterstock.comPerhaps one of the more visually stunning EVs on the road today, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) currently features two main products: an electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a pickup truck. Both chasses are built off a skateboard platform or shared framework. This enables Rivian to respond quickly to shifting consumer tastes, delivering at scale the vehicles people want to drive.To be fair, though, circumstances have not particularly favored RIVN stock. Since the Jan. opener, shares gave up nearly 69% of equity value. On the flipside, RIVN may be in the early innings of a comeback attempt. In the trailing five sessions, the equity unit popped up almost 8%. Most importantly under the context of this article, RIVN represents one of the EV stocks hedge funds are buying. In late November 2021, institutional ownership of RIVN amounted to 8.62%. However, this allocation jumped to 50.7% in October of this year.Story continuesLucid Group (LCID)A photo of the Lucid Motors Air EV from 2018.Source: ggTravelDiary / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Newark, California, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) focused on day one in developing some of the leading luxury EVs available. Fundamentally, management is arguably correct in targeting wealthy consumers first. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price of a new EV early this year stood at $62,876. It’s almost surely higher today, meaning that only the affluent can comfortably afford electric-powered transportation.Over time, economies of scale may change this narrative. Until it does, however, Lucid will target where the money is. In my opinion, it’s a smart business strategy. For now, the company must struggle through less-than-ideal income-related metrics in the hopes of eventual viability. Fortunately, the enterprise features a relatively healthy cash balance.Adding to the speculative sentiment is that LCID ranks among the EV stocks hedge funds are buying. Back in July of last year, institutional ownership of LCID sat at 2.34%. However, as of the latest read (end of October), this metric stood at 11.5%.Nio (NIO)Nio Berlin 2022, NIO stockSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Shanghai, China, Nio (NYSE:NIO) garnered intense popularity during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. Shares eventually went parabolic in January of last year. However, the company failed to recreate the magic – much of it driven by meme traders. For example, since the start of this year, NIO hemorrhaged nearly 62% of its equity value.At the same time, it appears that bullish traders believe the negativity has been overdone. In the trailing month, NIO shares gained a remarkable 31.6%. Further, over the past five sessions, the security shot up 24%. Certainly, with China focusing aggressively on building EV production facilities and infrastructure, Nio may still offer intrigue for gamblers. To be fair, Gurufocus.com labels NIO as a possible value trap. On the other hand, ownership data reveals that it’s one of the EV stocks hedge funds are buying. In August 2018, institutional ownership sat at 2.19%. As of the latest read, this metric pings at 18.6%.BYD (BYDDF)A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).Source: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.comBased in Shenzhen, China, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is a conglomerate manufacturing company that specializes in automobiles, buses, electric bicycles, trucks, forklifts, solar panels, and rechargeable batteries. Another one of the EV stocks hedge funds are buying that won big during the Covid-19 pandemic, BYD shares softened significantly. Presently, BYDDF fell nearly 27% YTD. Of course, BYD gained tremendous interest because of Warren Buffett. According to an early October 2022 article by Forbes, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) holds an approximately 7% stake in the Chinese automaker. To be sure, CNN recently reported that Buffett unwound some exposure to BYD. Nevertheless, Berkshire holds a significant amount of shares.Further, BYD features relatively decent financial metrics, including a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.8 times that beats out nearly 71% of the competition. Also, it ranks among the EV stocks hedge funds are buying. In late 2013, institutional ownership sat at 1.9%. Most recently, this metric rates at 9%.Lightning eMotors (ZEV)Silhouettes of charging electric car and wind turbines. Getting electricity from renewable energy sources. EVs. Electric vehicles. EV stocks.Source: Scharfsinn / ShutterstockBilled as an enterprise that provides real-world EVs for today, not someday, Lightning eMotors (NYSE:ZEV) attempts to marry innovation with practicality. Mainly, the company deploys zero-emission vehicle solutions for commercial fleets. Given the financial pressures associated with last-mile deliveries, Lightning presents a viable answer for fleet operators.Unfortunately, its relevance did not exempt the enterprise from market volatility. Indeed, ZEV easily ranks among the riskiest EV stocks hedge funds are buying. Since the start of this year, shares plunged more than 89% of market value. In the trailing month alone, ZEV evaporated nearly 56% of its value. That said, in the trailing five sessions, the stock gained over 19%.It’s possible that some of the most daring hedge funds recognize the potential extreme value proposition of Lightning, should the company succeed in its initiatives. In May of last year, institutional ownership barely represented a blip. As of October, this stat now stands at 17.2%.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to EV stocks hedge funds are buying, General Motors (NYSE:GM) fails to garner much excitement. As a legacy automaker, it simply doesn’t have the pizzazz of an upstart EV manufacturer. Nevertheless, GM offers a balanced approach to the future of transportation, integrating both electric and combustion-powered vehicles into the mix.Another factor to keep in mind is that American consumers trust GM. Sure, we can crack jokes about the historical quality standards (or lack thereof) of American cars. However, GM is an institution in this country. On the other hand, what about these upstarts? What happens if they fail? According to past precedent, drivers of vehicles whose underlying companies failed are on their own. Further, institutional ownership of GM stock has been steadily rising. For full disclosure, it’s not the greatest magnitude. However, the trajectory from 2011 to now has been impressive. For arguably the safest choice among direct-play EV investments, give GM a second look.Tesla (TSLA)Interior of the Tesla Model 3Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comEven though overall institutional ownership has been fading from its highs, I’d be remiss not to include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on this list of EV stocks hedge funds are buying. True, TSLA shares – after a meteoric ascendency from the spring doldrums of 2020 – succumbed to significant pressure this year, giving up more than 51% of equity value. Nevertheless, the company still commands tremendous respect.Just look at the analyst ratings for TSLA stock. Currently, TipRanks states that the consensus rating for Tesla is a moderate buy. This breaks down to 18 buys, eight holds, and two sells. As well, the consensus price target is $307.72. From the time of writing, this represents a 58% upside potential. Regarding the allocation of total institutional ownership, TSLA incurred a significant drop since peaking around 2016. Still, according to Insider Monkey, at the end of the third quarter of this year, 88 hedge funds owned a position in TSLA. This represented a 35.4% year-over-year lift.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:PNC) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$164. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, PNC Financial Services Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like PNC Financial Services Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At PNC Financial Services Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. In total, Executive VP Deborah Guild dumped US$452k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes PNC Financial Services Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$225m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that PNC Financial Services Group is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for PNC Financial Services Group you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

And a deserving one. But a look back at the list of prior winners contains a sobering lesson: greatness doesn’t always last.Our first COTY selection, for example, was Gap (GPS), in 2012. Believe it or not, the denim retailer was enjoying a resurgence back then, with the stock surging from 2011 to 2014. Since then, however, Gap has become the poster child for the old-school retail apocalypse, closing hundreds of stores, churning through CEOs and even inking a regrettable deal with one of the incarnations of Kanye West. Since peaking in 2014, the shares are down nearly 70%.Another stumbler, our 2013 selection, Disney (DIS), is still a blue-chip firm. But it hit a rough patch under the leadership of now-departed CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor, Bob Iger, is now at the helm once more, and he has a lot of fixing to do. Profits are well below pre-Covid levels and the stock is down 35% this year, more than twice the drop in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.Then there's former high rider Under Armour (UA). It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today.Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other Company of the Year setbacks?Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down. Shares soared in 2021, then plunged in 2022, and they’re now around where they were before the move into crypto. Block is back to Square 1.And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the ""meme"" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it’s down 87%%. Zoom out.Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so.Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation’s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up—including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises.Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don’t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory. We like companies that had rewarded investors—or, as with Costco this year, punish them less than the market as a whole. We also look for companies that capture the zeitgeist, as Costco did this year by helping consumers battle inflation. And we do, of course, hope our choices remain buzzy so we can check in on them in 10 or 20 years. Costco seems likely to meet that requirement.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

97,63b06e9c-74f2-40a0-9a1d-b7975d1c79f0,TGT,2022-12-05,Meet Yahoo Finance's 2022 Company of the Year: Costco,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-yahoo-finances-2022-company-of-the-year-costco-050135263.html,1670216495,STORY,"['COST', 'BJ', 'AMZN', 'TGT', '^GSPC', 'WMT']","[In a year of rampant inflation—not seen since the early 1980s—Costco (COST) was a warm hug to millions of loyal members by keeping prices for everything from food to gasoline as low as possible, just as rivals were aggressively jacking up prices.It also provided a warm hug to its fans on Wall Street, producing stellar results from sizable same-store sales increases to its stock price, which got the best of the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) index. Not to mention its sales of $222.7 billion in the fiscal year ended October, up a whopping 16 percent.For that and more—including Costco's continued status as one of the nation's best employers—we named the Issaquah, Washington–based warehouse behemoth our 2022 Company of the Year.If there were one company that could say rising prices weren't a negative, it was Costco. The Great Inflationary Outbreak of 2022 placed Costco's 842 worldwide stores squarely under the spotlight, offering up yet another opportunity for the 39-year-old retailer to showcase, to investors and members, its low-price leadership chops.Consider Cephas Sund from Los Angeles, California. The Costco cardholder, who loves organic products, says he shopped at conventional grocery stores prior to 2022, but skyrocketing prices put a hard stop on many of those excursions. ""When organic produce at the grocery stores is almost double what it cost at Costco, you (can) see where the savings quickly added up,"" Sund said.Sund and other customers we talked to said pretty much the same thing: Costco is a trusted retailer who had their backs throughout a challenging economic year. (That ought to tell you something.)How? As the cost of items like toothpaste and eggs soared, Costco in most cases was the last to raise prices at its cavernous 146,000-square-foot stores, explained Jefferies retail analyst Corey Tarlowe. ""The company is very strict on price, and I think that is evident through its steadfast commitment to its $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, competitive gas prices, and $4.99 rotisserie chickens,"" Tarlowe explained.Story continuesCase in point: As gas prices spiked to more than $5.00 a gallon in the summer, Costco saw lines at its hundreds of U.S. gas stations stretch out onto highways. Why? The company stayed true to its DNA as a wholesaler and kept gas prices at the lowest levels in town. Tarlowe says Costco's gas prices have typically been $0.25-$1.00 a gallon cheaper than the next closest competitor. (GasBuddy, a fuel station app, said Costco was the cheapest fuel station nationwide for the fifth year in a row. )Elizabeth Dragomir had to stand in a line of vehicles waiting for gas at Costco after a cyberattack crippled the biggest fuel pipeline in the country, run by Colonial Pipeline. Dragomir's car ran out of gas in the parking lot, in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., May 11, 2021. REUTERS/Jay PaulCostco held the line in other ways, too.As Walmart-owned Sam's Club jacked up membership prices by $5-$10 in September, Costco held firm. Execs said it wasn't the right time to tax consumers dealing with runaway inflation. (Sam's did undercut Costco's hot dog/drink combo by 12 cents. You can't win them all.)All of those warm embraces of customers was just Costco being Costco, long-time CEO Craig Jelinek told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview inside a new club opening in Lake Stevens, Washington.""I think first of all, we've been very fortunate. We've got great employees, and every company is only as good as everybody around them,"" said Jelinek, who has been with the company since nearly the time of its founding in 1984 by Jeffrey Brotman and Jim Sinegal. ""We've persevered and, we're very pleased that we've been able to get merchandise and continue to create value for our members and grow our membership base and drive sales.""This isn't a surprise to the retailer's long-time followers on Wall Street.Goldman Sachs' Kate McShane, for instance, has covered Costco for years. The company's focus on low prices and stellar operational execution is etched in the fabric of the retailer and has served the company well for years in good times and bad, she explained. The ""get it done"" mindset harkens back to the company's co-founders Jim Sinegal and Jeffrey Brotman, who created a no frills atmosphere that put the member at the center.""They're definitely one of the best run, best-in-class retailers,"" McShane said. ""We've not necessarily been that surprised Costco has been gaining market share as a result of some of the macroeconomic dynamics.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Experts like McShane believe Costco has gained market share notably in food throughout the pandemic, primarily from selling high quality private label products under its popular Kirkland Signature brand.Here are some Company of the Year worthy (and Wall Street-pleasing) highlights from the past year:Costco's same-store sales have out-performed conventional competitorsCostco's U.S. same-store sales for the nine-weeks ended October 30 increased by 10%. By comparison, third-quarter same-store sales for discounters Walmart (WMT) U.S. and Target (TGT) rose by a far slower 8.2% and 2.7%, respectively. Stacked up against its pure play warehouse rivals, Costco's recent sales growth trends are more in line. East Coast warehouse club rival BJ's Wholesale (BJ) saw third-quarter same-store sales increase by 9.7%. Same-store sales at Walmart's Sam's Club, increased 10% in the third quarter. But given that Costco is much bigger than the likes of Sam's, which has sales of about $59 billion, those same-store sales figures are impressive.Costco had a bang-up year within its key operating metricsFor the fiscal year-ended Aug. 28, Costco posted a 14.4% overall same-store sales increase; a 93% renewal rate for U.S. members; the addition of 7.3 million members; and a slight increase in net profit margins (a win in the hyper inflationary environment). Meanwhile, total cash clocked in at $11.1 billion, representing a hearty 34% of current assets.Despite 12-months of rock solid financial performance, the stock is down 13% this year, as of Dec. 2, but that still beats the S&amp;P 500 by a couple percentage points. Not bad in a year where bear markets reigned supreme.""We're really the extreme value proposition,"" Costco's 30-plus year CFO Richard Galanti told Yahoo Finance of the warehouse chain's financial success in a year of of eye-popping inflation.But like any other retailer, there are always uncertainties lurking.Analysts contend Costco's often relatively ""expensive"" price-to-earnings multiple — reflective of its years of steady and strong financials — requires the company to be perfect operationally at every turn.""The valuation on Costco, I can I can tell you, does give some people some angst because they are at such a big premium to the market. They're at such a big premium to Walmart and other big box retailers that some people don't totally understand why or they can't really bridge the gap between them,"" Goldman's McShane said.Costco didn't have a perfect November, as same-store sales growth cooled versus October, the company reported on Nov. 30. Investors promptly punished the often teflon stock on the view 2023 would bring further sales slowdowns.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Another wild card for 2023 is membership fees. Costco could raise them after years of holding the line, much to the disappointment of Wall Street. That would, of course, increase revenues and profits, but could also turn off some loyal, still inflation-weary, customers.Costco's last membership fee increase kicked in on June 1, 2017. The warehouse club took its Gold Star membership (the entry level Costco membership) fee up $5 to $60 and executive membership (offers 2% rewards on qualified purchases and other perks) fees increased by $10 to $120.""You're likely to hear something about this in the next (earnings) call in maybe six to 12 months, I think, and it'll probably be pretty likely that we'll hear something about it at least upcoming on the next earnings call,"" said Jefferies analyst Tarlowe. He estimates that a membership fee increase could boost Costco's earnings growth by a ""mid-single digit percentage"" rate. A Costco bull, he doesn't believe such a hike is priced into the retailer's already relatively expensive stock.Costco's CFO Galanti said the retailer isn't ready to raise the cost of its membership, but it will be something it clearly outlines to Wall Street when and if the time comes. Growth will also be driven by opening 20 to 25 new warehouses a year and the existing business drivers, Galanti added.In the meantime, Jelinek is paying careful attention to consumer spending this holiday season amid the mixed economic backdrop. Jelinek says he is pleased with the trends in the business to kick off the holiday shopping season, but does see a few warning flags that amount to uncertainties headed into 2023.""You know, a little bit. A little bit,"" Jelinek replied when asked if he sees a recession forming in the U.S. ""Our jewelry business has slowed down. If you look at the really high-end television sets, they've slowed down. I think right now people are very, very value conscious. They're always value conscious, but I think more so now than ever.""Obsessed with the $1.50 hot dog/soda combo at Costco like Brian Sozzi (left)? You can thank Costco CEO Craig Jelinek (right) for not raising the price of the combo, despite sky-high inflation.What the 70-year-old Jelinek may see forming, however, is a well-deserved retirement sometime within the next couple of years. In February, Costco promoted Ron Vachris to president and COO. He also joined Jelinek and Galanti on Costco's board of directors.Vachris, 56, has similar merchant DNA to Jelinek and Costco's founders. He began his retail career at the age of 16 at Price Club, which merged with Costco in 1993. Yahoo Finance briefly chatted with Vachris inside the Washington store opening — he was in true merchant form, walking aisles and chatting with members.Jelinek played any potential retirement announcement close to the vest.""Let's put it this way. He's [Ron] president. And we'll let it go at that,"" Jelinek said when asked about succession, adding he plans to be CEO ""for a while.""Costco's faithful members and employees surely would be OK with that timeline.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayBrian Sozzi, a former Wall Street analyst, is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Author Clement Moore later became wealthy by dividing his estate into smaller lots.A fitting start to the modern celebration of mass merchandising and conspicuous consumption. Retailing has changed a lot from what it was in Moore’s Day when the Ladies Mile of clothing stores defined high-end shopping. But the model has only been fully replaced recently, as department stores gave way to discounters and online merchants.This is the age of the “omnichannel,” with success defined as much by shipping as by marketing, as much by technology as by merchandising. The 21st century has reshuffled the retailing deck. But it can easily be reshuffled again, with some of the top retail stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis year, it might be.WMTWalmart$151.60TGTTarget$163.73COSTCostco$506.28MMacy’s$23.11SPGSimon Property Group$118.32Retail Stocks: Walmart (WMT)walmart stockSource: ShutterstockOne of the top retail stocks to buy is Walmart (NYSE:WMT), America’s biggest and possibly smartest retailer. Sales for fiscal 2023, which as with most retailers ends in Jan. after post-Christmas returns and inventory are taken, should grow 5.5% over last year. Operating cash flow last year came to $15.7 billion. For the three months ending in October, sales were $152.8 billion, but there was a loss of $1.8 billion, 66 cents/share.That’s because, as with great retail companies, Walmart keeps spending even when sales fall. Walmart spent $4.5 billion on dividends and share repurchases in the last year and had capital expenses of $12.1 billion. Still, the company predicts 3% growth this holiday season and has now raised its outlook for the full year to 5.5%. Growth is fastest at its international unit and Sam’s Club warehouse stores., where sales grew nearly 13%.Story continuesWalmart is spending big on technology, trying to replicate Amazon.Com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) online operations, at least in the U.S. market. One big innovation that has been copied by others is using its stores as fulfillment centers. It also has a membership program called Walmart Plus, which includes free shipping.This makes Walmart a pure value play, falling behind the averages when growth is in fashion, and catching up when profits are demanded. This has been a catch-up year, the shares are up 6% while the average S&amp;P stock is down over 15%. But the rush to quality has brought its price-to-earnings ratio up to an eye-popping 47 and the dividend yield down to 1.46%. This Christmas season, Walmart’s dominant position will remain, according to Placer.AI, which measures store visits. If you see the stock on sale, at say $150-$152/share, TheStreet.Com says buy it. But as with anything else, you pay up for quality.Retail Stocks: Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockUnder Brian Cornell, who became CEO in 2014, Target’s (NYSE:TGT) returns were easily beating those of Walmart, until recently. In 2022, supply chain issues and organized theft clobbered the stock. Over five years it’s up 177%, but since Jan., it’s down 29%.This was reflected in third-quarter earnings, which were cut in half from a year ago at $712 million, $1.55 per share, on sales of $26.5 billion. Management also cut its guidance for Christmas sales to 3%. While Target is often compared to Walmart, it’s just one-sixth the size. This can increase volatility. When it was growing fast, late in the last decade, the stock zoomed. As growth slowed in 2022, it nosedived. The third quarter numbers sent it down 13%. But that weakness isn’t reflected in store visits, says Placer.ai. Store visits to Target are growing faster than those to Walmart, and its share of the market has held steady.I’m a long-time fan of Cornell. I liked his moves in the 2010s to build smaller, urban stores, and to improve online delivery. What I like better is his willingness to adjust. Target is now going directly after Walmart with a 150,000-square-foot store design that can also act as an online fulfillment center. This lets it deliver orders to many customers the same day they’re placed. Change is constant, and the best retailers recognize that.Its recent problems have made Target a cheaper stock. The price-to-earnings ratio is now below 23 and the dividend yield is above 2.6%. The market cap is just 75% of the store’s sales. When I see those kinds of prices, on quality merchandise, I call it a bargain.Retail Stocks: Costco Wholesale (COST)Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession PickSource: ShutterstockCostco runs have become as popular as beer runs in America’s high-end suburbs. Over the last five years, the stock is up over 188%, and even in 2022, the shares are up 6%. The key is that Costco doesn’t sell. Instead, it creates an environment where people happily buy in mass quantities. The warehouse concept, of buying in bulk, and paying a membership fee for the privilege, helps justify America’s desire for SUVs and oversized houses.The result for Costco is double-digit growth, even when currency losses in its international unit are factored in.  Earnings, which once averaged no more than its take from membership fees, have now gone far beyond that, to $5.84 billion in the 12 months ending in August.Following Costco has become a cottage industry at sites like Eat This, Not That. Some shoppers camp out next to a new store before its opening.Costco is a quality name, but you pay for quality. Sometimes you can pay too much. We saw that a year ago with companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Will we see it next year with Costco?The dividend of 90 cents/share now yields just 0.68%. It’s been low for years. But the price-to-earnings ratio is over 40. You’re paying more for Costco earnings than those of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Macy’s (M)Macy's stock m stockSource: ShutterstockMacy’s (NYSE:M) is one of the last of the giant department stores that dominated retailing in the 20th century. It was left for dead during the worst of the COVID pandemic, trading for a little over $6/share. It’s now over $23, nearly making up the ground lost over the last five years. Management has even brought back its dividend.Macy’s may be a full-price retailer, but the stock sells at off-price. We’re talking a price-to-earnings ratio of under 5, a dividend yielding 2.72%, and a market cap of $6.3 billion which is just one-quarter of last year’s sales. Meanwhile, visits to department stores are surging, according to Placer.ai. There are strong indications many of these shoppers are heading to Macy’s. It may just be post-COVID nostalgia, but it’s an opportunity.Macy’s has begun opening small stores outside traditional malls. The stores, called Market by Macy’s, even have a doppelganger under the chain’s other store label, Bloomingdale’s. Macy’s is also downsizing some of the existing stores and using the space as fulfillment centers for online orders. (It’s doing what Target is doing, only using real estate it already controls.) After years of effort, Macy’s now has 0.9% of the U.S. e-commerce market, more than the long-standing e-commerce brand Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY).Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIn all my years covering finance, few stocks have intrigued me as much as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG). It’s a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that, when malls began dying in the last decade, became its own landlord. Working with privately held Authentic Brands, which first monetized dead celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, then moved into the business of live ones like Shaquille O’Neal, it began buying its tenants. Simon began with Aeropostale. It now owns Forever 21. It owns Brooks Brothers and even JCPenney. Simon and Authentic buy brands in bankruptcy, using money from partners like Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), then sell the brand online and offline. What Simon can’t sell at full retail it moves to its own outlet centers. By getting into these deals, Simon was able to collect 90% of its rents during the worst of the pandemic. This also lets it play hardball when other tenants threatened to go under because it knew the value of its brands.While Simon doesn’t deliver capital gains, the stock is down over 26% in 2022, its REIT structure means it always hands investors back its profits. Over the last year that has meant $7.20 in dividends for stock that currently trades at around $118/share, a yield of over 6%. Where the real estate value of its malls has fallen, it can redevelop the land for long-term capital gains. The last decade has given malls a bad odor, but at least for this Christmas, that may be the smell of nostalgia. Simon’s moves have made it a popular choice for REIT investors but it is also, now, a retail bellwether.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in COST, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL.

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices Analog Devices Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, for US$2.3m worth of shares, at about US$166 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$169). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 43% of Vivek Jain's holding.Insiders in Analog Devices didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Analog Devices insiders own about US$292m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Analog Devices Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.

If you want to see more stocks under $25 to buy, go directly to 5 Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now.The market is calmer given the latest economic data that shows that inflation may be peaking. October's core inflation growth of 5.2% year over year was lower than September's growth of 5% year over year.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) has also declined to below 20 recently. With the VIX lower, it seems investors are not expecting as much volatility in the S&amp;P 500 as they did before.Nevertheless, there is still debate over what might happen next.Although the Federal Reserve has indicated that it won't increase interest rates as fast as it did in the past several months, many economists still think the U.S. central bank has a ways to go before it finishes raising rates.If rates rise too much, demand for many companies might weaken and the U.S. economy might slow. If that happens, corporate earnings might not be as strong as expected and stocks could be significantly more volatile when the next earnings season begins.There is also a chance of a recession next year even if the stock market has rallied recently. Billionaire founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, recently said for consumers, ""Take some risk off the table. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference."" Bezos meant consumers should try to save some money in case the economy worsens.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many stocks across many different sectors.jan-huber-J51Wt_AvKbc-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now, we picked 10 stocks that could potentially grow earnings per share in the long term.

Our asset sensitive balance sheet continues to grow and benefit from rising interest rates despite the increased funding pressure that is evident across the industry. We are pleased with our ongoing net interest margin enhancement and consistent net interest income growth. Despite a reduction in origination activity, loan growth remained strong as payoffs slowed meaningfully during the quarter. Additionally, a handful of positive credit resolutions led to approximately $6 million of net loan recoveries during the third quarter 2022 and a reduction in non-accrual loan balances at September 30, 2022.""At a stock price of $12.49 per share as of 12/4, the bank trades 1.04 times book value and has a dividend yield of 3.52%. Shares of Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) are around the same price as what they were in 2012 so much of the return has been due to the dividend.Like Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY), Robinhood Markets, Inc.

The cost of ignoring digital assets is high, it said.The development of blockchains that are smart contract-enabled and applications with real-world use has accelerated this year, the report said. Speculative trading may be widespread, but it's the “underlying blockchain technology driving this speculation that could be revolutionary.”Bank of America says “retail and institutional disengagement” could further pressure crypto prices, but notes that digital asset prices fell 22% between Nov. 2 and Nov. 10 before rising 6% through Nov. 25, which shows that investors may be moving on and are focused on blockchain technology’s long-term disruption potential.Read more: Bernstein: Crypto User Activity Is Moving On-Chain Following FTX’s Collapse]"

It has long been stuck on the drawing board, partly due to a battle over how big a share of the project's gold output would go to the PNG government.""Our teams have made significant progress in recent weeks and months to find a balance. With continuing goodwill on both sides, we anticipate a positive outcome will be reached,"" Newcrest Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas told the conference.The country is also locked in talks for a special mining lease to restart the Porgera gold mine, which has been shut for more than two and a half years, following an agreement reached last year with co-owners Barrick Gold Corp and China's Zijin Mining Group.""We understand you are not a charity but please take my people with you,"" Marape said at the conference, referring to companies looking to develop resource projects.Marape has been pressing for PNG to receive a bigger share of the benefits from mining and energy projects since he first became prime minister in 2019, and so far has succeeded in renegotiating deals with energy giants ExxonMobil Corp and TotalEnergies on their gas projects.Story continuesHe highlighted the country's proximity to resource-hungry Asian nations as an advantage for its mining and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The biggest single foreign investment in the country is the PNG LNG project, run by Exxon.""Last year when I visited China I was able to sell 3 million metric tonnes of gas. Papua New Guinea is using its bilateral network and multilateral networks to trade and can find markets,"" Marape said.The next major gas development awaiting a final investment decision is the Papua LNG project. TotalEnergies has said it aims to decide whether to go ahead with the project around the end of 2023.($1 = 3.6166 kina) (Reporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; Editing by Diane Craft and Kenneth Maxwell)]"

But uncertainty over the path of U.S. inflation, as well as the Fed’s terminal rate, is still expected to spur volatility in the market.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,800.10 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,813.40 an ounce, with both instruments trading at a near four-month high.Other precious metals were buoyed by bets on a less hawkish Fed. Platinum futures rose 0.6%, while silver futures added 0.9%. Precious metal markets logged deep losses this year as rising U.S. interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.This cost gold its safe haven status, and has seen the yellow metal trade more in line with traditional risk-driven assets this year.Sentiment in recent sessions was also supported by more Chinese cities relaxing anti-COVID measures over the weekend. Economic hubs including Beijing and Shanghai both relaxed some movement and testing measures, as the government sought to placate a wave of unprecedented protests against its strict zero-COVID policy.Reuters also reported that the government is gearing up to announce a nationwide easing of restrictions in the coming weeks.Industrial metals rose sharply on the prospect of a broader Chinese reopening, given that the country is one of the biggest commodity importers in the world.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.4% to $3.8718 a pound after rallying more than 6% last week. Prices of the red metal were also trading at a three-week high.Copper demand is forecast to skyrocket on a Chinese reopening, while supply tightened in recent months on lower production from major miners in Chile and Peru.Related ArticlesGold sticks to $1,800, copper boosted by China COVID reopeningOil rallies over 2% on China reopening, OPEC holds output steadyRussia says it won't accept oil price cap and is preparing response]"

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Walt Disney has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney peKeen to find out how analysts think Walt Disney's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Walt Disney's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Walt Disney would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 58%. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen a very unpleasant 72% drop in EPS in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 49% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.1% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Walt Disney is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Walt Disney maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.The company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis. You can assess many of the main risks through our free balance sheet analysis for Walt Disney with six simple checks.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

And a deserving one. But a look back at the list of prior winners contains a sobering lesson: greatness doesn’t always last.Our first COTY selection, for example, was Gap (GPS), in 2012. Believe it or not, the denim retailer was enjoying a resurgence back then, with the stock surging from 2011 to 2014. Since then, however, Gap has become the poster child for the old-school retail apocalypse, closing hundreds of stores, churning through CEOs and even inking a regrettable deal with one of the incarnations of Kanye West. Since peaking in 2014, the shares are down nearly 70%.Another stumbler, our 2013 selection, Disney (DIS), is still a blue-chip firm. But it hit a rough patch under the leadership of now-departed CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor, Bob Iger, is now at the helm once more, and he has a lot of fixing to do. Profits are well below pre-Covid levels and the stock is down 35% this year, more than twice the drop in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.Then there's former high rider Under Armour (UA). It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today.Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other Company of the Year setbacks?Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down. Shares soared in 2021, then plunged in 2022, and they’re now around where they were before the move into crypto. Block is back to Square 1.And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the ""meme"" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it’s down 87%%. Zoom out.Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so.Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation’s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up—including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises.Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don’t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory. We like companies that had rewarded investors—or, as with Costco this year, punish them less than the market as a whole. We also look for companies that capture the zeitgeist, as Costco did this year by helping consumers battle inflation. And we do, of course, hope our choices remain buzzy so we can check in on them in 10 or 20 years. Costco seems likely to meet that requirement.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG, MGIC Investment Corp. MTG and Radian Group Inc. RDN.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Dividend-Paying Multiline Insurers for a Stable PortfolioApart from price appreciation, investors look for returns on their investment in the form of dividends. Despite a choppy market, attributable to Fed’s hawkish move, concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a stronger dollar, the insurance industry has been gathering steam banking on solid fundamentals.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry has gained 0.9% year to date. Players like MetLife Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., MGIC Investment Corp. and Radian Group Inc., who have an impressive dividend history, continue to offer a stable income.By virtue of the nature of their business, multiline insurers stand to benefit from a diversified portfolio, which, in turn, lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations.Also, an increase in the exposure of intangibles and an increase in cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.The Fed’s strategic move to hike interest rates to curb inflation has been benefiting the insurance industry as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The Fed has already raised rates six times this year. Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, the higher the rates, the better the investment results. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Story continuesPlayers are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Dividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected five multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%. These stocks have a payout ratio of less than 60, reflecting enough room for future dividend increases. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Radian Group, with a market capitalization of $3 billion, is a credit enhancement company, which supports homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services.RDN witnessed five-year annualized dividend growth of 248.4%. Riding on continued financial strength and flexibility, Radian declared a 43% increase in quarterly dividends in the first quarter of 2022, which translated into the highest dividend yield in the private MI industry. Its current dividend yield of 4.1% betters the industry average of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 16. (Check Radian Group’s dividend history here)Radian Group Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Radian Group Inc. QuoteRadian’s mortgage insurance portfolio is expected to create a strong foundation for future earnings. RDN remains focused on improving its mortgage insurance portfolio, the main catalyst of long-term earnings growth. For 2022, Radian estimates total mortgage originations to be nearly $3 trillion, reflecting an 8% increase in purchase originations and a 58% decrease in refinance activity.Also, given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to see fewer claims than before. Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows. A strong capital position helps this Zacks Rank #2 insurer deploy capital via share repurchases and dividend hikes that enhance shareholders’ value.MGIC Investment, with a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, engages in the insurance underwriting and related services business primarily in the United States and Canada.MTG has an impressive dividend history, banking on a solid capital position. The largest private mortgage insurer in the United States increased dividends three times in the last five years. Its dividend yield of 2.9% betters the industry average of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 14, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 16.9%. (Check MGIC Investment’s dividend history here)MGIC Investment Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | MGIC Investment Corporation QuoteMGIC Investment expects new business, combined with increasing annual persistency, to result in the continued growth of the insurance-in-force portfolio. The multi-line insurer expects to retain higher levels of liquidity at the holding company. MGIC Investment, carrying Zacks Rank #2, has constructed a solid capital base to increase the long-term value to shareholders while maintaining financial strength and flexibility.MetLife, with a market capitalization of $60.1 billion, is an insurance-based global financial services company providing protection and investment products to a range of individual and institutional customers.Since 2011, the company has been successfully raising its quarterly dividend at a CAGR of 9.5%.  Its current dividend of $2.00 yields 2.6%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 27, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 4.7%. (Check MetLife’s dividend history here).MetLife, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | MetLife, Inc. QuoteThis Zacks Rank #3 company’s focus on streamlining its business, numerous acquisitions and partnerships, and balance sheet will drive long-term growth. MET has undertaken strategies to control cost and increase efficiency and remains optimistic about achieving a direct expense ratio below the target set for 2022. A strong balance sheet, coupled with sound free cash flows, supports its shareholder value-boosting effort.Prudential, with a market capitalization of $39.6 billion, is a financial services leader that offers an array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management and real estate services.PRU has been increasing its dividend for the past 14 years. Its dividend yield of 4.4% compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 47, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 8.5%. (Check Prudential’s dividend history here).Prudential Financial, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuotePRU is on track to reprice as well as move toward lower-risk and less capital-intensive products. As this Zacks Rank #3 insurer transforms to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive business, it expects to double its growth businesses to more than 30% of earnings and the individual annuities business to 10% or less of earnings. PRU remains focused on investing in businesses to expand its addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Prudential envisions about a 65% free cash flow ratio of earnings and about two times its dividend.The Hartford Financial, with a market capitalization of $24.1 billion, is one of the major multi-line insurance and investment companies in the country, providing investment products, group life and group disability insurance, property and casualty insurance and mutual funds in the United States.HIG increased its dividend at a five-year CAGR of 8.7%. Its dividend of $1.70 yields 2.2%. This Zacks Rank #3 insurer’s payout ratio is 21, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 9.5%. (Check Hartford Financial’s dividend history here).The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. QuoteHartford Financial has been vending non-core businesses to concentrate on its U.S. operations and enhance its operating leverage. HIG expects its Hartford Next initiative to bring cumulative savings of $560 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023.  Hartford Financial is gaining from lower COVID-related losses, an improved Commercial Lines loss ratio and a rise in earned premiums.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

126,4287ec5c-98f8-39d2-aa3f-db9436496337,DVN,2022-12-05,15 Most Capitalist Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-capitalist-companies-world-212921330.html,1670189361,STORY,"['GE', 'CVX', 'DVN', 'XOM', 'MMM', 'GEO', 'WFC-PD']","[In this article, we take a look at 15 most capitalist companies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the excesses of capitalism and go directly to 5 Most Capitalist Companies in the World. The unbridled capitalism that has gone around in countries like the US has created unprecedented levels of harm on a planetary scale. It has resulted in massive resource depletion, ecological degradation, global warming, wealth inequality and labor exploitation.The Capitalist Impact on the PlanetAn MIT study in 1972 used World3, a system-dynamics simulation with variables like population growth, food production, industrial output, pollution rate and resources, to predict that our business-as-usual approach was grievously unsustainable. The study further said that unsustainable capitalistic practices would likely result in collapse of global infrastructure somewhere in the mid-21st century unless measures were taken in time to transition to a more sustainable approach to growth. A new study, published in Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology, tested the World3 model with the data of the previous 38 years and vindicated it, concluding that we’re headed towards a societal collapse if we don't change our practices.Wealth Inequality and LaborApart from environmental damage, this form of capitalism has also resulted in income inequality. For instance, Bloomberg showed that while the wealth of the top 1% increased by 27% in 2021, the American middle-class saw its wealth decline by 26.6% in the same year.  Additionally, many companies are known for union-busting to maximize shareholder value and prefer that wages are determined by supply and demand. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership has declined from 20.1% in 1983 to 10.3% in 2021. This is reflected in another statistic from the Economic Policy Institute, which shows that productivity has gone up by 62.5%, while wages in comparison have only grown by 16% from the period 1979-2021.Story continuesAs population and education levels rise, more skill-oriented people are available for particular jobs. The competition becomes more intense, and so productivity grows exponentially relative to the linear wage-growth. This is where ESG investing comes in. ESG is an acronym for Environmental, Social and Governance. It is a set of standards that determine how ethical a corporation is environmentally, socially and in corporate governance. It helps socially and environmentally conscious investors to find and invest in companies that share their values, in practice. ESG and Corporate FinanceStern School of Business did a meta-analysis of a 1000 studies published on ESG and corporate financial performance between 2015-2020 and found a positive correlation between corporate ESG measures and financial performance (in metrics like Return on Assets and Return on Equity) for 58% of the studies. It also found that corporate investment in environmental sustainability not only had no negative effect on short-term financial performance but actually had a positive effect in the long-term. Another insight is that a good performance in ESG provides downside protection in times of social and/or economic crisis as well as improved risk management. Tech companies have some of the lowest ESG risks. For instance, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have ESG-risk scores of only 16.7 and 15.2 respectively, making them some of the most pro-ESG companies in the world.15 Most Capitalist Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology For our list of the 15 most capitalist companies in the world, we’ve selected companies with high ESG-risk scores from the top 25 corporations with the biggest market share. We’ve gathered ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a Morningstar firm that rates corporate sustainability. It defines ESG risk as the risk to a company's economic value from the lack of, or poor management of, ESG factors.  It calculates ESG-risk scores based on unmanaged risk to a company. Unmanaged risk is divided into unmanageable risk - risks that can't be managed by the company, and management gap - risks that can be managed by the company for ESG but aren't. Sustainalytics assign a quantitative ESG risk score between 0 and 50 to each company and based on that score, it groups them into any of the five risk categories; Negligible (0-10) Low (10-20), Medium (20-30), High (30-40), and Severe (40-50).15. The Geo Group, Inc (NYSE:GEO)ESG Risk Score: 31.7ESG-Risk: HighThe Geo Group, Inc. (NYSE:GEO) is a multinational real estate investment company that invests primarily in private prisons and mental health facilities in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia. The company has a high ESG risk score.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)ESG Risk Score: 33.6ESG-Risk: HighWells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the most capitalist companies in the world, going by its ESG risk. The company’s audits by KPMG have been questioned for their independence by several Democratic politicians like Elizabeth Warren.In September, 2016, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for issuing 5,60,000 credit cards to customers without their consent. 13. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)ESG Risk Score: 33.6ESG-Risk: High3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is an American global corporation that manufactures products primarily related to industrial safety and healthcare. It has been subjected to several lawsuits, including a recent one by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who said that the case followed a multi-year investigation that showed that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) marketed products containing Polyfluoroalkyl and Perfluoroalkyl compounds for decades. The lawsuit alleged that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) knew that these compounds were carcinogenic, and were responsible for developmental defects in addition to cancer but continued selling them.12. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)ESG Risk Score: 34.5ESG-Risk: HighMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the biggest social media company in the world, with a user-base of roughly 3 billion people on their platforms - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ESG risk is ""High"" according to Sustainalytics.11. Hitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T)ESG Risk Score: 34.6ESG-Risk: HighHitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T) is a Japanese global conglomerate primarily involved in designing and manufacturing electronics for various industries like construction, defense and automotive. In November 2018, Hitachi Chemical, an arm of Hitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T), disclosed that it discovered over 30 products that are used in consumer electronics, and approximately 1,900 businesses that it supplies to, were affected by inspection problems that were pervasive across all of its factories in Japan.The issues were made public in late June in the same year when Hitachi acknowledged that it had fabricated data for 500 clients' industrial lead-acid batteries. Employees skipped inspections or used testing methods other than those agreed upon with clients. Some test results were also fabricated.10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)ESG Risk Score: 36.5ESG-Risk: HighExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil and hydrocarbon companies in the world. Its ESG-risk score is high, at 36.5. Exxon has one of the biggest carbon footprints in the world as far as corporations go. In 2019, the scope-3 emissions of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) amounted to 730 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. For perspective, this is how much Canada emits in a year.9. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)ESG Risk Score: 36.7ESG-Risk: HighDevon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is another energy corporation from the US. While the company has pledged net-zero emissions by 2050, these do not include its scope-3 emissions. In addition, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) hasn't laid out any particular details in its sustainability reports that show how it intends to achieve its net-zero goals. As per the Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has not worked to meet the indicators for capital allocation alignment for its long-term GHG reduction targets as of 2021. The company does not have a Paris-Agreement-aligned lobbying position either.8. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)ESG Risk Score: 37.6ESG-Risk: HighShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It has one of the worst ESG ratings, primarily because of its environmental impact. The company has “committed” to bring its carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. However, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is accelerating its exploration of additional sources of hydrocarbons and intends to grow its fossil fuel business by 20% in the coming years, per Client Earth, a nonprofit environmental group. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)’s 2020 emissions amounted to 1.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalents, and its emissions for the period 2018-2030 are projected to account for 1.6% of the total carbon budget.7.

If you want to read about some more stocks that Cramer and Dalio are bullish on, go directly to Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks.Ray Dalio, the chief of Bridgewater Associates, is one of the most respected hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Only stocks that Jim Cramer has also been bullish on in the past few weeks were selected. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These Stocks10. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. On November 29, McDonald’s said that its stores in Kazakhstan were forced to temporarily close this month after cutting ties with Russian companies and running out of supplies. Latest data shows that Dalio owned more than 2.1 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $487 million. On September 1, Jim Cramer placed the company among a group of dividend-paying stocks that he was bullish on for the coming months. He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On October 12, Costco declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The forwarded yield was 0.77%. On November 28, Costco Dropped the Price on Its Internet-Famous Thomasville Sectional to Just $2,500 for Cyber Monday. 13F filings show that Dalio owned more than 1.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $566 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company was building everywhere, including big projects in China, and did not want to raise their membership fees because it was part of a larger plan by the retail giant to pressure the competition.   On November 29, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock and lowered the price target to $578 from $581. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide. On November 17, PepsiCo declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share with a forward yield of 2.85%. New data reveals that Dalio owned more than 4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $656 million. Jim Cramer recently lauded the “other-wordly” numbers posted by the firm in a bear market.  On October 14, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman maintained an Overweight rating on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stock and raised the price target to $185 from $183, highlighting the company's beat and raise in the third quarter.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 65 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.3 billion in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), compared to 62 in the previous quarter worth $4.9 billion.Alongside Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also in the stable and predictable cash flow camp, though with a very different business model, global food and beverage company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reported very strong organic growth in the first quarter, driven by healthy price/mix, and raised revenue guidance, while holding EPS guidance. Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

132,5791f8bc-79c7-3846-a8a0-1b40f1002b2b,PLD,2022-12-05,Prologis (NYSE:PLD) shareholders have earned a 15% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-nyse-pld-shareholders-earned-140042756.html,1670162442,STORY,['PLD'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) shareholders have enjoyed a 77% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 47% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Prologis While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Prologis achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.2% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 12% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Prologis' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Prologis the TSR over the last 5 years was 101%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 14% in the twelve months, Prologis shareholders did even worse, losing 23% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 15% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Prologis better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Prologis (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Prologis is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), since the last five years saw the share price fall 41%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 13% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Tripadvisor While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Tripadvisor has made a profit in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.It could be that the revenue decline of 14% per year is viewed as evidence that Tripadvisor is shrinking. That could explain the weak share price.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on TripadvisorWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Tripadvisor's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Tripadvisor hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of -34% exceeds its share price return of -41%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Tripadvisor shareholders are down 18% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 14%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

The iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth exchange-traded fund (NYSEARCA:IVW) is down nearly 25% with one month to go in 2022. Some of the worst performers from this ETF are going to need a new CEO.Before I come up with my three names of CEOs that need to go — it’s never an easy task to determine if a CEO is underperforming — investors need to consider whether growth stocks make sense in 2023. If they do, some of 2022’s underperformers might come charging back, which makes the task at hand even more difficult. No one likes to see someone lose their job due to a situation (such as the movement of share prices) beyond their control.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, to qualify for this dubious list, not only must these growth stocks be down in 2022, but they also should be lower over the past five years. In addition, the named CEOs must have been in the top job for at least three of those five years.Here goes.BENFranklin Resources$27.28NWLNewell Brands$12.84AOSA.O. Smith$60.48Franklin Resources (BEN)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Franklin Resources (BEN).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comDon’t shoot me; I’m only the messenger. Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) made this list because it was a holding in IVW, which is a collection of companies exhibiting growth characteristics and whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. The investment firm’s stock is down nearly 20% in 2022 and 37.26% over the past five years, almost 93 percentage points worse than the S&amp;P 500.I’m pivoting slightly on my first choice. Rather than selecting current CEO Jennifer Johnson, who’s been with the company in various senior positions since 2003, but only CEO since February 2020, I’ve chosen Executive Chairman Greg Johnson, who was CEO of the company from July 2005 through February 2020. Since Johnson was CEO or Executive Chairman, Franklin’s stock has moved sideways. That’s an abysmal performance. Over the same period, BlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) shares are up 797.68%. Story continuesJohnson’s no Larry Fink.And yes, I know, his grandfather founded the company in 1947, and the family controls a big chunk of the stock, but if Franklin were a meritocracy, he’d have been gone a long time ago.  Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comI sure hope that Martin Franklin has sold most or all of his Newell Brands (NYSE:NWL) stock. The company best known for its Rubbermaid storage products has become a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. As a result, its stock is down 41% year-to-date and nearly 59% over the past five years. Now back to Martin Franklin. Franklin built Jarden into a huge business that Newell acquired in late 2015 for more than $15 billion in cash and stock. Three years later, he left Newell’s board and started a proxy fight with Starboard Value, the activist investor. He believed that Newell’s management failed to execute the integration properly. Ultimately, Martin left that fight, and Starboard recruited Carl Icahn and his son Brett to resume the proxy fight. Today, Carl Icahn owns 8.3% of the company, and Brett sits on the board. On July 30, 2019, Newell announced the hiring of Ravi Saligram as CEO. More than three years later, its stock has lost nearly 16% of its value. From its May 2021 high, it’s down 52%.If Carl Icahn wants to get a return on his four-year investment, the CEO has got to go.A.O. Smith (AOS)Source: ShutterstockThis last one is by far the most difficult of selections because I’ve been a fan of A.O. Smith (NYSE:AOS) for over a decade. “I love Smith’s business model because it manufactures its products primarily for domestic consumption. That means most of its manufacturing in China is meant for Chinese customers, and the same is virtually true everywhere else it does business — including the U.S.,” I wrote in Nov. 2012.The good news is that AOS is up 284% over the past decade. The bad news is that the maker of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers is down more than 29% YTD and 3.7% over the past five years, lagging the index by nearly 58 percentage points. CEO Kevin Wheeler joined the company in 1994, moving up the ranks until becoming CEO in September 2018. I generally like internal promotions to CEO. However, in this instance, it appears that Wheeler’s been unable to get the company back on track. When he took over, it had annual sales of $3.19 billion and $444.2 million in earnings. In 2021, sales were higher at $3.5 billion, but earnings were essentially the same at $487.1 million. While the first nine months of 2022 show growth on both the top and bottom line over last year, Wheeler’s had more than four years to tell A.O. Smith’s story.Investors aren’t buying it.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now.Since the start of 2022, the S&amp;P 500 Index has observed a decline of 15.5%. The index also remained in the bear market territory from mid-June to mid-July and from the third week of September to early November. As investors return after the Thanksgiving holiday, they are preparing themselves for the final interest rate hike of the year in December. The majority consensus is that the benchmark interest rate will be increased by 50 basis points (bps) to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% when the members of the Federal Reserve meet on December 14. The current benchmark interest rates are already at their highest level since 2008. The Fed has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 bps on the past four consecutive occasions. The raging inflation and increasing interest rates have dampened the sentiments of investors across Wall Street. Experts are anticipating the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance till the inflation rate falls below the 4% level. This will still be two percentage points (ppts) higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Inflation for October 2022 was recorded at 7.7%, which reflected a decline for the fourth consecutive month and is at its lowest level since January 2022. However, inflation is currently hovering at a four-decade high.Goldman Sachs anticipates that the bear market that has hit stocks this year could continue in 2023 as well. The New York-based diversified financial services firm believes that the recent recovery in stocks is just a knee-jerk reaction to the heavy losses that investors have faced this year. There are still three factors that need to materialize for the stocks to find a bottom. The first factor is that the valuations need to be more depressed to be in line with recessionary markets. Secondly, the business cycle should reach a true bottom in terms of economic deterioration before actual recovery occurs. Finally, the benchmark interest rates need to reach a peak. This has not been the case till now, as experts believe that the benchmark interest rate will reach a peak of 5.5% in 2023 before cuts start to take place in 2024. In such circumstances, investors are on the lookout for the best bear market stocks to shield their savings. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are attracting investors’ attention amidst bearish momentum in the markets.Story continues13 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 13 best bear market stocks, we have looked at the business fundamentals and operational efficiency of these companies.

We used Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds to rank these stocks according to the level of hedge fund ownership as of Q3 2022.Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now13. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a Houston, Texas-based midstream company involved in transporting crude oil and natural gas.The company is a master limited partnership (MLP) which bounds it to distribute 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends. As a result, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stock offers an enticing one-year forward dividend yield of 7.68% as of November 30. The company reported record transportation of crude oil and natural gas during Q3 2022. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) anticipates the positive momentum to continue next year also as it’s expecting an increase in the production of crude oil and natural gas from the Permian basin.Fairholme Capital Management shared its bullish outlook on Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is the largest position in the Fund. Enterprise provides processing and transportation services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil. These hydrocarbons are critical for modern life and have few, if any, ready substitutes. Commodity prices do not greatly affect the company’s toll road fees. Enterprise is priced at less than nine times distributable cash flows and pays a 7.5% cash distribution.”12. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is a Shanghai, China-based manufacturer of electric Sedan and Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). The company manufactures various models to cater to diverse markets.In a research note issued to investors on November 21, Edison Yu at Deutsche Bank highlighted that the worse is finally over for NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) as the Chinese government has started to relax its zero COVID policy. Analysts are bullish on NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) as they expect the company to overcome production-related challenges and deliver around 20,000 units in December. Yu increased the price target on NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) from $20 to $21 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock.Here’s what Horos Asset Management said about NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“At the beginning of April the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”11. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a Chicago, Illinois-based beverage, confectionary, food, and snacks company with a presence in over 160 countries.During Q3 2022, Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates increased its stake in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), reflecting optimism on the company’s future outlook. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported strong Q3 2022 results in early November. Experts have highlighted Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) as one of the stocks with a strong upside potential due to its diverse range of products and presence across a wide variety of retail channels. Furthermore, the company is expected to benefit from an improvement in overall consumer sentiment as inflation has started to ease. Mondelez International, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MDLZ) forward dividend yield stands at 2.33% as of November 30.Here’s what Coho Partners said about Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based beverage company known for its namesake brand and other leading beverages around the world.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted strong Q3 2022 results, outperforming consensus estimates. The momentum was driven by strong growth in organic sales that countered the adverse impact of currency headwinds. Following the results, Peter Grom at UBS increased the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $63 to $68 and maintained a Buy rating on October 26. The analyst added that the company’s risk and reward profile looks favorable, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.82% as of November 30. The company is also the fourth biggest holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Here’s what Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare company that offers a retail pharmacy network, health insurance services, and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). The company is at the ninth position on our list of the best bear market stocks to buy now.On November 23, Erin Wright at Morgan Stanley assigned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $119 along with an Overweight rating. The analyst has an overall bullish outlook on the company’s long-term earnings prospects. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) offers an annual payout of $2.20, translating into a forward dividend yield of 2.18% as of November 30. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has also revealed that it is looking for acquisition opportunities that could advance the company’s broader strategy and increase its presence in key areas.Vltava Fund shared its stance on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Bentonville, Arkansas-based company that is considered the biggest retailer in the world through its hypermarkets, supercenters, and supermarkets.In an update issued to investors on November 16, Robert Ohmes at Bank of America highlighted that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is gaining market share in the middle of challenging and uncertain economic circumstances. The analyst anticipates the company to gain more market share in the grocery segment as it offers strong value through its everyday low prices (EDLP) strategy. The analyst increased the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)  from $155 to $165 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock following the strong Q3 2022 earnings results.Here’s what Leaven Partners said about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a Chicago, Illinois-based pharmaceutical company that has invested over $50 billion in research and development since its spin-off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013.Trung Huynh at Credit Suisse initiated coverage on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) on November 17 with an Outperform rating and a target price of $170. The analyst termed the company as one of the two best ideas in the US large-cap pharmaceutical industry. Huynh thinks that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a strong drug pipeline, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in. Furthermore, the analyst thinks the guidance of 35% to 55% erosion in sales for Humira in 2023 following the expected launch of nine biosimilars is “too conservative.” AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.74% as of November 30.Baron Funds shared its bullish outlook on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Jersey-based diversified healthcare company that is involved in consumer health, medical technology, and pharmaceutical products.The company is working on spinning off its consumer health segment as a separate publicly listed entity to focus on its core medical technology and pharmaceutical businesses. Experts anticipate the spin-off will improve the valuation of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Furthermore, the company intends to reach revenue of $60 billion from its pharmaceutical business by 2025. The segment contributed a total revenue of $52.08 billion in 2021. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has provided the impetus to the medical technology division through the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) for $16.6 billion. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best market stocks as the company has increased its dividends for the past 50 years, making it a Dividend King. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.55% as of November 30.Here’s what Mayar Capital said about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“J&amp;J is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions. This leaves JNJ with about 48 cents on the dollar in profit…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

138,c3e9eea2-b32d-3b2a-bd57-bc9b07524a3a,OXY,2022-12-05,Why OXY Stock Is a Solid Energy Play to Buy and Hold,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-oxy-stock-solid-energy-111518930.html,1669979718,STORY,"['OXY', 'BRK-A', 'CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock has made a stunning comeback since late 2020 on two major catalysts.The first was the epic run-up in crude oil and natural gas prices. The second was the accumulation of a large position by Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B). The result is that OXY stock has soared by more than four-fold.After this incredible run, future gains are most likely going to arrive gradually. However, do not take this to mean that “the party’s over” with OXY. Sure, a growing number of stock market commentators are now taking a bearish stance on the stock.  Yet take a look at the details, and it’s clear their pessimism is unfounded.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPut simply, this stock isn’t on the verge of giving back its 2022 gains in 2023. In fact, quite the opposite. Let’s dive in, and find out why Oxy stands to stay a winner.OXYOccidental Petroleum$68.80Debunking the OXY Stock NaysayersOccidental Petroleum may have a seal of approval from the “Oracle of Omaha,” but that hasn’t stopped the skeptics from laying out a bear case for the stock.This take on OXY stock is predicated on the view that the global economic slowdown will further soften oil demand. In turn, putting more pressure on oil prices. However, while crude oil and natural gas prices may not be heading back to their respective 2022 highs, that doesn’t mean a full return to 2021 levels is in store.At least, that’s the takeaway from the latest forecast from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Per the EIA’s latest short-term energy outlook, crude oil prices are expected to average around $89.33 per barrel in 2023. That’s a price moderately above current levels (around $81.43 per barrel), and well above average prices reported in 2020 and 2021 ($39.17 and $68.21 per barrel, respectively).Story continuesGiven the prospect of another tightening of supply, and a sooner-than-expected rebound in Chinese demand, this forecast makes sense. If it plays out, Occidental’s earnings could hold steady near expected 2022 levels ($10.03 per share), as opposed to dropping by 22%, as currently anticipated.Parlaying Record Earnings into Continued GainsDon’t expect OXY stock to more-than-double in price next year, as shares have done so far this year (up 123.7% since January). That said, while Occidental’s next doubling-up may be several years down the road, there is a path for shares to deliver strong returns in the years ahead.Why? For starters, the underlying value of each OXY share will likely continue to rise, as the company uses its record-high earnings to repay debt and repurchase shares. This year alone, Occidental has reduced its outstanding debt by $9.6 billion and has spent $2.6 billion on share repurchases.Besides increasing the value of Occidental’s equity, paying down debt leaves the company in a better position to increase its dividend, perhaps back to its pre-pandemic rate of payout (79 cents per quarter). Bringing back the dividend to or near its high-water mark would provide an additional lift to long-term returns.Atop the debt reduction and return-of-capital efforts, there is also a growth catalyst at play. As I’ve discussed previously, Occidental Petroleum’s now-nascent direct air capture business could bolster its existing fossil fuel business, and become a profitable segment in its own right.Bottom LineIf you already own OXY, there’s no need to “take the money and run.”If you have yet to add it to your portfolio, feel free to do so. Although shares have appreciated substantially over the past two years, you haven’t “missed out” completely on this opportunity.Current trends remain favorable for oil prices. This will enable the company to maintain high earnings, which it can put to work further increasing shareholder value. Over a longer timeframe, this fossil fuels giant could reap unexpected rewards from the global push for net-zero carbon emissions.Alongside these catalysts, this stock remains undervalued. Shares trades for less than seven times estimated 2022 earnings.With a strong chance of delivering solid returns in the years ahead, OXY stock is still one of the best energy stocks out there to buy and hold.OXY stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in OXY.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stock is up an impressive 124% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 14% over the last quarter.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 74% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 17% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Vertex Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

141,70bcfabd-e2a1-34e0-8291-0c99fc40a51a,NSC,2022-12-05,A Look At The Fair Value Of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-norfolk-southern-120151983.html,1670241711,STORY,['NSC'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.67bUS$2.91bUS$3.03bUS$3.15bUS$3.24bUS$3.33bUS$3.42bUS$3.50bUS$3.57bUS$3.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.34%Est @ 2.23%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$68bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$68b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$33bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$55b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$254, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Norfolk Southern as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.062. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Norfolk Southern, there are three important factors you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 1 warning sign for Norfolk Southern we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does NSC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

But the deal he approved did not include paid sick days for workers, a key sticking point for unions in contract talks with five major U.S. railroads.Proposals seen by Reuters filed by activist investors ask Norfolk Southern Corp and Union Pacific Corp to offer ""a reasonable amount"" of paid sick time, determined by company directors. If accepted each resolution would appear as a ballot item at the railroads' springtime shareholder meetings.Kate Monahan, a director at Trillium Asset Management, the socially minded investor that filed the resolution at Union Pacific, said more flexible sick time would have broader benefits like reducing workforce turnover.""There’s a clear business case that makes sense to us as investors,"" she said.A Union Pacific representative did not comment on the resolution, but referred to a trade group statement that industry employees already receive substantial time and leave for longer-term illnesses.A Norfolk Southern representative declined to comment.Resolutions about worker welfare have drawn more support at corporate annual meetings in recent years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Voting on the resolutions would not be binding.Railroads worry implementing paid sick leave would require more employees at a time when many have cut their workforces dramatically. Had sick time been included in recent federal legislation it would cut U.S. rail earnings 1.5% to 2%, Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors wrote in a Nov. 30 investor note.(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston, Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)]"

The index also remained in the bear market territory from mid-June to mid-July and from the third week of September to early November. As investors return after the Thanksgiving holiday, they are preparing themselves for the final interest rate hike of the year in December. The majority consensus is that the benchmark interest rate will be increased by 50 basis points (bps) to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% when the members of the Federal Reserve meet on December 14. The current benchmark interest rates are already at their highest level since 2008. The Fed has increased the benchmark interest rates by 75 bps on the past four consecutive occasions. The raging inflation and increasing interest rates have dampened the sentiments of investors across Wall Street. Experts are anticipating the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance till the inflation rate falls below the 4% level. This will still be two percentage points (ppts) higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Inflation for October 2022 was recorded at 7.7%, which reflected a decline for the fourth consecutive month and is at its lowest level since January 2022. However, inflation is currently hovering at a four-decade high.Goldman Sachs anticipates that the bear market that has hit stocks this year could continue in 2023 as well. The New York-based diversified financial services firm believes that the recent recovery in stocks is just a knee-jerk reaction to the heavy losses that investors have faced this year. There are still three factors that need to materialize for the stocks to find a bottom. The first factor is that the valuations need to be more depressed to be in line with recessionary markets. Secondly, the business cycle should reach a true bottom in terms of economic deterioration before actual recovery occurs. Finally, the benchmark interest rates need to reach a peak. This has not been the case till now, as experts believe that the benchmark interest rate will reach a peak of 5.5% in 2023 before cuts start to take place in 2024. In such circumstances, investors are on the lookout for the best bear market stocks to shield their savings. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are attracting investors’ attention amidst bearish momentum in the markets.Story continues13 Best Bear Market Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyTo shortlist the 13 best bear market stocks, we have looked at the business fundamentals and operational efficiency of these companies.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a Houston, Texas-based midstream company involved in transporting crude oil and natural gas.The company is a master limited partnership (MLP) which bounds it to distribute 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends. As a result, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stock offers an enticing one-year forward dividend yield of 7.68% as of November 30. The company reported record transportation of crude oil and natural gas during Q3 2022. Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is the largest position in the Fund. Enterprise provides processing and transportation services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil. These hydrocarbons are critical for modern life and have few, if any, ready substitutes. Commodity prices do not greatly affect the company’s toll road fees. Enterprise is priced at less than nine times distributable cash flows and pays a 7.5% cash distribution.”12. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is a Shanghai, China-based manufacturer of electric Sedan and Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). The company manufactures various models to cater to diverse markets.In a research note issued to investors on November 21, Edison Yu at Deutsche Bank highlighted that the worse is finally over for NIO Inc.

(NYSE:NIO) from $20 to $21 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock.Here’s what Horos Asset Management said about NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“At the beginning of April the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”11. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Mondelez International, Inc.

Furthermore, the company is expected to benefit from an improvement in overall consumer sentiment as inflation has started to ease. Mondelez International, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MDLZ) forward dividend yield stands at 2.33% as of November 30.Here’s what Coho Partners said about Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”10. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based beverage company known for its namesake brand and other leading beverages around the world.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) posted strong Q3 2022 results, outperforming consensus estimates. The momentum was driven by strong growth in organic sales that countered the adverse impact of currency headwinds. Following the results, Peter Grom at UBS increased the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $63 to $68 and maintained a Buy rating on October 26. The analyst added that the company’s risk and reward profile looks favorable, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in.

Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare company that offers a retail pharmacy network, health insurance services, and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). The company is at the ninth position on our list of the best bear market stocks to buy now.On November 23, Erin Wright at Morgan Stanley assigned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $119 along with an Overweight rating.

CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has also revealed that it is looking for acquisition opportunities that could advance the company’s broader strategy and increase its presence in key areas.Vltava Fund shared its stance on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Bentonville, Arkansas-based company that is considered the biggest retailer in the world through its hypermarkets, supercenters, and supermarkets.In an update issued to investors on November 16, Robert Ohmes at Bank of America highlighted that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is gaining market share in the middle of challenging and uncertain economic circumstances. The analyst anticipates the company to gain more market share in the grocery segment as it offers strong value through its everyday low prices (EDLP) strategy. The analyst increased the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)  from $155 to $165 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock following the strong Q3 2022 earnings results.Here’s what Leaven Partners said about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a Chicago, Illinois-based pharmaceutical company that has invested over $50 billion in research and development since its spin-off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013.Trung Huynh at Credit Suisse initiated coverage on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) on November 17 with an Outperform rating and a target price of $170. The analyst termed the company as one of the two best ideas in the US large-cap pharmaceutical industry. Huynh thinks that AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a strong drug pipeline, making it one of the best bear market stocks to invest in. Furthermore, the analyst thinks the guidance of 35% to 55% erosion in sales for Humira in 2023 following the expected launch of nine biosimilars is “too conservative.” AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 3.74% as of November 30.Baron Funds shared its bullish outlook on AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a New Jersey-based diversified healthcare company that is involved in consumer health, medical technology, and pharmaceutical products.The company is working on spinning off its consumer health segment as a separate publicly listed entity to focus on its core medical technology and pharmaceutical businesses. Experts anticipate the spin-off will improve the valuation of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Furthermore, the company intends to reach revenue of $60 billion from its pharmaceutical business by 2025. The segment contributed a total revenue of $52.08 billion in 2021. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has provided the impetus to the medical technology division through the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) for $16.6 billion. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best market stocks as the company has increased its dividends for the past 50 years, making it a Dividend King. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.55% as of November 30.Here’s what Mayar Capital said about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“J&amp;J is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spend a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics.To make that dollar, however, JNJ typically spends about 25 cents to make the products themselves and another 27 cents on marketing and general administrative functions. This leaves JNJ with about 48 cents on the dollar in profit…” (Click here to see the full text)In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022.

He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses.

Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide.

(NASDAQ:PEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also in the stable and predictable cash flow camp, though with a very different business model, global food and beverage company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reported very strong organic growth in the first quarter, driven by healthy price/mix, and raised revenue guidance, while holding EPS guidance. Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

(Nasdaq: SNDX) and Incyte (Nasdaq: INCY) today announced that  results from the Phase 1/2 trial of axatilimab, Syndax's anti-CSF-1R antibody, in patients with recurrent or refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following two or more prior lines of therapy, were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.A total of 40 patients with refractory disease who received a median of four prior systemic therapies, some of which included ibrutinib, ruxolitinib and belumosudil, were treated in the Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial. Thirty-nine patients were evaluable for response as of the data cutoff. All study participants were treated for a median duration of 29 weeks, with all responding patients treated for a median duration of 38 weeks at the time of data cut-off.  Results showed:Overall response rate by cycle 7 day 1 was 82% (18/22) in the Phase 2 cohort (1mg/kg every two weeks) and 67% (26/39) among all evaluable patients treated in the dose escalation study. Best ORR (complete response + partial response) observed at any point during the study in all patients treated was 69% (27/39).Median duration of response for Phase 2 responding patients was not reached; 33% of patients experiencing sustained response lasting 20 weeks or longer.A decrease in glucocorticoids doses was observed in 52% of responding patients.Responses were observed across a range of organ systems with difficult to treat manifestations such as lung (5/16), skin (5/35), and joints and fascia (19/31).A clinically meaningful disease improvement using the Lee Symptom Score of at least 7 points was seen in 58% (21/36) of all evaluable patients.Story continuesAxatilimab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in this refractory population. The most common adverse events were consistent with on-target effects of CSF-1R inhibition. In the Phase 1 cohort, two dose limiting toxicities were reported, both at the 3 mg/kg every two weeks dose.  There were no ≥Grade 3 on-target toxicities of CSF-1R blockade seen in the Phase 2 cohort. There was no incidence of cytomegalovirus or other viral reactivation, and no apparent increases in risk for infection.  Serious adverse events occurred in 40% (16/40) of patients, with seven (18%) patients discontinuing the study intervention due to adverse events, four (10%) of which were deemed treatment-related.""We believe axatilimab is well positioned to potentially be a first- and best-in-class anti-CSF-1R antibody for cGVHD,"" said Kate Madigan, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Syndax.  ""The robust, durable responses and multi-organ clinical benefit observed in this Phase 1/2 trial in refractory patients support the potential for axatilimab to serve as an effective intervention in this underserved population.""""The results of this Phase 1/2 dose finding study are very encouraging regarding the ability of axatilimab to provide meaningful clinical responses in chronic GVHD patients that have been refractory to multiple prior therapies"" said Carrie Kitko, M.D., Medical Director of the Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Program at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, and the corresponding author of the Phase 1/2 publication. ""Combining both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects through the targeting of disease associated macrophages would be particularly exciting for this patient population that would benefit from a reduction in sclerotic and fibrotic manifestations of chronic GVHD. In the past simply stopping further progression of those manifestations was considered a ""win"", but some of these patients are actually having improvements in joint range of motion and skin tightening.""The article, titled ""Axatilimab for chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies: results of a Phase 1/2 study,"" is available online.About Chronic Graft-Versus-Host DiseaseChronic graft-versus-host disease, an immune response of the donor-derived hematopoietic cells against recipient tissues, is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which can last for years. Chronic GVHD is estimated to develop in approximately 40% of transplant recipients, and affects approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S.1,2 Chronic GVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue.3About AxatilimabAxatilimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of signaling through the CSF-1 receptor has been shown to reduce the number of disease-mediating macrophages along with their monocyte precursors, which has been shown to play a key role in the fibrotic disease process underlying diseases such as cGVHD and IPF. Phase 1/2 data of Axatilimab in cGVHD demonstrating its broad activity and tolerability was last presented at the 63rd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.  Axatilimab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and IPF. In September 2021, Syndax and Incyte entered into an exclusive worldwide co-development and co-commercialization license agreement for axatilimab. Axatilimab is being developed under an exclusive worldwide license from UCB entered into between Syndax and UCB in 2016.Enrollment in the Company's global pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of axatilimab in patients with recurrent or refractory active cGVHD who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy is complete, and topline data is expected mid-2023. Additionally, a Phase 1 combination trial of ruxolitinib and axatilimab, led by Incyte, is in preparation and expected to initiate by end of the first quarter of 2023, and a Phase 2b trial of axatilimab in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis led by Syndax is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2022.For more information about AGAVE-201, visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04710576About Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(NASDAQ:INTU) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-22m-worth-intuit-110039337.html,1670238039,STORY,['INTU'],"[Despite the fact that Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock rose 3.9% last week, insiders who sold US$22m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$518, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit Intuit Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP and Chief People &amp; Places Officer, Laura Fennell, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$9.1m worth of shares at a price of US$611 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$408. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Intuit insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Intuit Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Intuit shares. In total, insider Varun Krishna sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Intuit insiders own 2.8% of the company, worth about US$3.2b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Intuit Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Intuit stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - Intuit has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course Intuit may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the excesses of capitalism and go directly to 5 Most Capitalist Companies in the World. The unbridled capitalism that has gone around in countries like the US has created unprecedented levels of harm on a planetary scale. It has resulted in massive resource depletion, ecological degradation, global warming, wealth inequality and labor exploitation.The Capitalist Impact on the PlanetAn MIT study in 1972 used World3, a system-dynamics simulation with variables like population growth, food production, industrial output, pollution rate and resources, to predict that our business-as-usual approach was grievously unsustainable. The study further said that unsustainable capitalistic practices would likely result in collapse of global infrastructure somewhere in the mid-21st century unless measures were taken in time to transition to a more sustainable approach to growth. A new study, published in Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology, tested the World3 model with the data of the previous 38 years and vindicated it, concluding that we’re headed towards a societal collapse if we don't change our practices.Wealth Inequality and LaborApart from environmental damage, this form of capitalism has also resulted in income inequality. For instance, Bloomberg showed that while the wealth of the top 1% increased by 27% in 2021, the American middle-class saw its wealth decline by 26.6% in the same year.  Additionally, many companies are known for union-busting to maximize shareholder value and prefer that wages are determined by supply and demand. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership has declined from 20.1% in 1983 to 10.3% in 2021. This is reflected in another statistic from the Economic Policy Institute, which shows that productivity has gone up by 62.5%, while wages in comparison have only grown by 16% from the period 1979-2021.Story continuesAs population and education levels rise, more skill-oriented people are available for particular jobs. The competition becomes more intense, and so productivity grows exponentially relative to the linear wage-growth. This is where ESG investing comes in. ESG is an acronym for Environmental, Social and Governance. It is a set of standards that determine how ethical a corporation is environmentally, socially and in corporate governance. It helps socially and environmentally conscious investors to find and invest in companies that share their values, in practice. ESG and Corporate FinanceStern School of Business did a meta-analysis of a 1000 studies published on ESG and corporate financial performance between 2015-2020 and found a positive correlation between corporate ESG measures and financial performance (in metrics like Return on Assets and Return on Equity) for 58% of the studies. It also found that corporate investment in environmental sustainability not only had no negative effect on short-term financial performance but actually had a positive effect in the long-term. Another insight is that a good performance in ESG provides downside protection in times of social and/or economic crisis as well as improved risk management. Tech companies have some of the lowest ESG risks. For instance, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have ESG-risk scores of only 16.7 and 15.2 respectively, making them some of the most pro-ESG companies in the world.15 Most Capitalist Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology For our list of the 15 most capitalist companies in the world, we’ve selected companies with high ESG-risk scores from the top 25 corporations with the biggest market share. We’ve gathered ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a Morningstar firm that rates corporate sustainability. It defines ESG risk as the risk to a company's economic value from the lack of, or poor management of, ESG factors.  It calculates ESG-risk scores based on unmanaged risk to a company. Unmanaged risk is divided into unmanageable risk - risks that can't be managed by the company, and management gap - risks that can be managed by the company for ESG but aren't. Sustainalytics assign a quantitative ESG risk score between 0 and 50 to each company and based on that score, it groups them into any of the five risk categories; Negligible (0-10) Low (10-20), Medium (20-30), High (30-40), and Severe (40-50).15. The Geo Group, Inc (NYSE:GEO)ESG Risk Score: 31.7ESG-Risk: HighThe Geo Group, Inc. (NYSE:GEO) is a multinational real estate investment company that invests primarily in private prisons and mental health facilities in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia. The company has a high ESG risk score.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)ESG Risk Score: 33.6ESG-Risk: HighWells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the most capitalist companies in the world, going by its ESG risk. The company’s audits by KPMG have been questioned for their independence by several Democratic politicians like Elizabeth Warren.In September, 2016, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for issuing 5,60,000 credit cards to customers without their consent. 13. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)ESG Risk Score: 33.6ESG-Risk: High3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is an American global corporation that manufactures products primarily related to industrial safety and healthcare. It has been subjected to several lawsuits, including a recent one by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who said that the case followed a multi-year investigation that showed that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) marketed products containing Polyfluoroalkyl and Perfluoroalkyl compounds for decades. The lawsuit alleged that 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) knew that these compounds were carcinogenic, and were responsible for developmental defects in addition to cancer but continued selling them.12. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)ESG Risk Score: 34.5ESG-Risk: HighMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the biggest social media company in the world, with a user-base of roughly 3 billion people on their platforms - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ESG risk is ""High"" according to Sustainalytics.11. Hitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T)ESG Risk Score: 34.6ESG-Risk: HighHitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T) is a Japanese global conglomerate primarily involved in designing and manufacturing electronics for various industries like construction, defense and automotive. In November 2018, Hitachi Chemical, an arm of Hitachi, Ltd. (TOKYO:6501.T), disclosed that it discovered over 30 products that are used in consumer electronics, and approximately 1,900 businesses that it supplies to, were affected by inspection problems that were pervasive across all of its factories in Japan.The issues were made public in late June in the same year when Hitachi acknowledged that it had fabricated data for 500 clients' industrial lead-acid batteries. Employees skipped inspections or used testing methods other than those agreed upon with clients. Some test results were also fabricated.10.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Fast Is UnitedHealth Group Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. UnitedHealth Group managed to grow EPS by 14% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our analysis has highlighted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for UnitedHealth Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$315b. That's encouraging news for the company!Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for UnitedHealth Group?Are UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$501b company like UnitedHealth Group. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.7b. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is UnitedHealth Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Of course, just because UnitedHealth Group is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Although UnitedHealth Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Merck &amp; Co. Inc. MRK, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Walmart Inc. WMT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top 4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Enhance Your Portfolio in DecemberWe are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.U.S. stock markets are witnessing a solid rally since mid-October, which is likely to extend till the year-end. We have selected four Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to gain from the ongoing rally. These stocks are — Caterpillar Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Walmart Inc.Dow Suffers the LeastYear to date, the three large-cap-centric stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 5.4%, 14.5% and 26.6% respectively. On Dec 1, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip index of Wall Street — technically exited bear territory after closing more than 20% higher over its recent low posted on Sep 30.The primary concern of the U.S. economy is soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed has already hiked interest rates sharply by 3.75% year to date.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks rather than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks.

If you want to read about some more stocks that Cramer and Dalio are bullish on, go directly to Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks.Ray Dalio, the chief of Bridgewater Associates, is one of the most respected hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Only stocks that Jim Cramer has also been bullish on in the past few weeks were selected. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These Stocks10. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. On November 29, McDonald’s said that its stores in Kazakhstan were forced to temporarily close this month after cutting ties with Russian companies and running out of supplies. Latest data shows that Dalio owned more than 2.1 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $487 million. On September 1, Jim Cramer placed the company among a group of dividend-paying stocks that he was bullish on for the coming months. He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On October 12, Costco declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The forwarded yield was 0.77%.

Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company was building everywhere, including big projects in China, and did not want to raise their membership fees because it was part of a larger plan by the retail giant to pressure the competition.   On November 29, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock and lowered the price target to $578 from $581. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide. On November 17, PepsiCo declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share with a forward yield of 2.85%.

(NASDAQ:PEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also in the stable and predictable cash flow camp, though with a very different business model, global food and beverage company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reported very strong organic growth in the first quarter, driven by healthy price/mix, and raised revenue guidance, while holding EPS guidance. Notably, its beverage business showed expanding margins.” Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks. Suggested Articles:10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy15 Best Dividend Stocks For Passive Income12 Safest Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

It crunches!Frito-Lay declares 2022 'The Year of Crunch' and shares the biggest consumer snack-habit findingsThe ""crunch"" factor was on top as an important component of the perfect snack in the latest Frito-Lay U.S. Trend Index. The index polled consumers on their snacking preferences and found that more than 70 percent of snackers would reach for a food with a crunch when considering their perfect snack.Beyond crunch, the Snack Index found other important snack factors included sweet (66%), salty (61%) and filling (53%). Almost half of those surveyed expressed that, when thinking of a perfect snack, that snack is also nostalgic and reminds them of a specific moment in time (49%).""Consumers are at the heart of all we do, so considering every component of a snack – including the crunch factor – is very important to us,"" said Denise Lefebvre, senior vice president of R&amp;D for Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods North America. ""We know the perfect snack is different for everyone, which is why we constantly listen to consumers and then engage our chefs and our Culinary Center to provide variety, deliver on flavor and explore new recipes consumers love.""While Frito-Lay predicts that all adults will continue to look for crunchy snacks in 2023, generational differences and end-of-year snacking behaviors also contribute to trends to watch.A Generational Snacking GapSnacking habits vary by generation and snacking is not one size fits all. The latest Snack Index showed that nearly 50% of Gen Z believes snacking is most satisfying after dark. They are also twice as likely as other generations to order delivery when a snack craving hits. On the other hand, 50% of millennials satisfy their late-night snack cravings by visiting grocery or convenience stores. GenXers (64%) and baby boomers (62%) are most likely to prepare a comfort food recipe at home.The Joy of Holiday SnackingHeading into the holiday, snacking is associated with good feelings. While 65% of adults crave snacks the most when they want to treat themselves, 61% are unlikely to crave snacks when they are feeling down during the holidays according to the Snack Index. Snacking is also a sensory experience, with 55% of those surveyed indicating they crave snacks most when they smell them and 52% crave snacks when they see them.Story continuesFor 45% of respondents looking for a flavor that is available during a limited time and 49% looking forward to variety and party packs this holiday, specialty offerings will be a key factor. Americans are also looking to share their treats – 55% most look forward to sharing snacks with friends and family this season. According to the Snack Index, 62% of GenZers and 52% of millennials will be turning to social media for holiday recipes to try.While Americans are more likely to try a recipe made with Lay's Potato Chips (46%), they also responded that they'll most likely try out a recipe with Rold Gold Pretzels (40%) than Cheetos Original (37%).""As people of all ages experiment with recipes and enjoy snacks this holiday season, we're excited to bring them new limited time products such as Lay's Clusters, Cheetos Snowflakes, PopCorners Cinnamon Sugar and more, as well as fun new recipes made by our very own consumers that include your favorite snacks,"" said Lefebvre.For more inspiration, a newly revamped website with never before seen Frito-Lay and Quaker recipes has just been released at MoreSmilesWithEveryBite.com. This new site propels engagement with Frito-Lay and Quaker consumers by empowering innovative ways to incorporate our products into their daily lives while also incentivizing them to submit their own recipes and snacking ideas.Survey MethodologyThis poll was conducted by Morning Consult between November 4-November 7, 2022 among a national sample of 2,212 Adults.

Reuse is also a critical lever to meet PepsiCo's goals to reduce virgin plastic per serving by 50% by 2030 and to become Net Zero by 2040, and progress toward these goals will also be driven – in partnership with our bottlers – by increasing recycled content in our packaging.Aligned with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's ""Reuse – Rethinking Packaging"" framework, PepsiCo will pursue four approaches to achieve its new packaging goal, including expanding its SodaStream business, both at home and in workplaces through SodaStream Professional; building out its refillable plastic (PET) and glass bottle offerings in partnership with PepsiCo bottlers; growing its fountain drinks business with reusable cups; and accelerating growth in powders and concentrates.PepsiCo has more than 80 markets around the world offering reusable packaging solutions, including:The widespread international availability of SodaStream and SodaStream Professional, and its continued growth, enables consumers to reinvent how they consume some of the world's most loved beverage brands and personalize their choices in reusable containers, potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030.Refillable and returnable glass and plastic programs in major markets including Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Germany and the Philippines.Many of our brands, including Gatorade, Propel, Muscle Milk and Evolve, are offered as concentrated powders or tablets to allow consumers to customize the drink to their preferences in their own containers.Story continues""Fundamentally transforming the traditional beverage consumption model will require making reusable and refillable options accessible and convenient, at scale, for consumers – and that's what PepsiCo aims to do,"" said Jim Andrew, Chief Sustainability Officer, PepsiCo. ""PepsiCo will accelerate our investment in disruptive innovation and advocate for policies that allow us to scale up reusable packaging options, platforms and programs so that we can offer consumers a wide variety of alternative ways to enjoy their favorite beverages while moving away from reliance on single-use packaging.""""We know we cannot recycle our way out of this plastic pollution crisis,"" said Sander Defruyt, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Plastic Initiative Lead. ""By avoiding single-use packaging waste in the first place, reuse business models are an important part of creating a circular economy. Our latest Global Commitment report illustrated the lack of progress on reuse across the industry, and highlighted a lack of ambition when it comes to reuse strategies. We welcome this significant step forward by PepsiCo and we hope other global brands will follow suit and similarly set quantitative reuse targets helping to reduce their use of virgin plastics in packaging.""PepsiCo will continue working with multiple partners to develop new infrastructure to support reuse and refill models.  Most recently, PepsiCo joined the Closed Loop Partners NextGen Consortium.  Through the consortium, it is working collaboratively with stakeholders across the value chain to design and test new models to enable the scale up of reusable cups, a critical component of supporting a reuse infrastructure alongside beverage fountains.Press ContactPepsiCoMediaRelations@pepsico.comAbout PepsiCoPepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.

If you want to read about some more stocks that Cramer and Dalio are bullish on, go directly to Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These 5 Stocks.Ray Dalio, the chief of Bridgewater Associates, is one of the most respected hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His comments on the alarming situation at the stock market in the past few months have confirmed macro investors fears. Dalio recently warned that the aggressive monetary policies of the central bank in the United States would lead to stagflation, an economic condition that comes with high inflation where economic growth and employment are not robust enough, leading to stalled growth models that stop short of an all–out recession. Jim Cramer, one of the ardent admirers of Dalio and a leading finance guru, has also echoed these sentiments. Both stalwarts, who have been investing at the stock market for decades, are bullish on names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the market shifts away from growth towards value to protect against volatility. Dalio manages an equity portfolio worth over $19 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022 with the top holdings in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. Our MethodologyThese were picked according to the investment portfolio of Bridgewater Associates at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Only stocks that Jim Cramer has also been bullish on in the past few weeks were selected. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ray Dalio Are Betting on These Stocks10. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. On November 29, McDonald’s said that its stores in Kazakhstan were forced to temporarily close this month after cutting ties with Russian companies and running out of supplies. Latest data shows that Dalio owned more than 2.1 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $487 million. On September 1, Jim Cramer placed the company among a group of dividend-paying stocks that he was bullish on for the coming months. He said that it can resume the long march higher real soon and was the perfect “bounce-back candidate” despite recent overhangs like cost inflation and a strong dollar. Story continuesOn October 28, RBC Capital analyst Christopher Carril maintained an Outperform rating on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and raised the price target to $295 from $275, noting that the company’s third-quarter earnings highlighted the firm’s ability to play both offense and defense amid macro uncertainty.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.3 billion in McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), compared to 58 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion. Just like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the stocks that Jim Cramer and Ray Dalio are bullish on. 9. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. On November 29, Starbucks announced that its Starbucks for Life, the sugar cookie-inspired beverages, were back. Regulatory filings show that Dalio owned more than 2.9 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $252 million. Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company had posted encouraging revenue growth and margin expansion numbers recently and also adding that the firm had invested extensively in technology to modernize the firm in recent months.  On November 4, Citi analyst Jon Tower maintained a Neutral rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock and raised the firm's price target to $93 from $90, noting that the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results confirmed its business momentum in the US and improving international trends.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) with 5.8 million shares worth more than $444.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a premiere global coffee brand supported by over 32,600 stores across the world. The firm has a long history of beverage innovation and strong employee/barista relations with the firm paying above-market wages and benefits. Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and finances. The company generates steady and consistent cash flow, selling millions of cups of premium coffee every day. The company’s share price declined in part due to its large business in China which was largely shut down due to Covid restrictions and because of rising commodity and labor costs. We think the shares are attractively priced for a company that should grow 10% plus per year with a dividend yield of 2.6% at our average cost.” 8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Securities filings show that Dalio owned more than 11.4 million shares in the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022 worth $642 million. Cramer recently named the firm among a basket of dividend-paying firms he was bullish on. Cramer said that the firm was “textbook defensive stock” since the high dividend yield offered investors protection from market swings. On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third-quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. On October 12, Costco declared a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The forwarded yield was 0.77%.

Cramer discussed the stock during an appearance on CNBC on September 14, noting that the company was building everywhere, including big projects in China, and did not want to raise their membership fees because it was part of a larger plan by the retail giant to pressure the competition.   On November 29, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock and lowered the price target to $578 from $581. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65     PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide.

But the deal he approved did not include paid sick days for workers, a key sticking point for unions in contract talks with five major U.S. railroads.Proposals seen by Reuters filed by activist investors ask Norfolk Southern Corp and Union Pacific Corp to offer ""a reasonable amount"" of paid sick time, determined by company directors. If accepted each resolution would appear as a ballot item at the railroads' springtime shareholder meetings.Kate Monahan, a director at Trillium Asset Management, the socially minded investor that filed the resolution at Union Pacific, said more flexible sick time would have broader benefits like reducing workforce turnover.""There’s a clear business case that makes sense to us as investors,"" she said.A Union Pacific representative did not comment on the resolution, but referred to a trade group statement that industry employees already receive substantial time and leave for longer-term illnesses.A Norfolk Southern representative declined to comment.Resolutions about worker welfare have drawn more support at corporate annual meetings in recent years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Voting on the resolutions would not be binding.Railroads worry implementing paid sick leave would require more employees at a time when many have cut their workforces dramatically. Had sick time been included in recent federal legislation it would cut U.S. rail earnings 1.5% to 2%, Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors wrote in a Nov. 30 investor note.(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston, Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Union Pacific. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Union Pacific already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Union Pacific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Union Pacific is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Union Pacific Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$206m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Union Pacific. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

And a deserving one. But a look back at the list of prior winners contains a sobering lesson: greatness doesn’t always last.Our first COTY selection, for example, was Gap (GPS), in 2012. Believe it or not, the denim retailer was enjoying a resurgence back then, with the stock surging from 2011 to 2014. Since then, however, Gap has become the poster child for the old-school retail apocalypse, closing hundreds of stores, churning through CEOs and even inking a regrettable deal with one of the incarnations of Kanye West. Since peaking in 2014, the shares are down nearly 70%.Another stumbler, our 2013 selection, Disney (DIS), is still a blue-chip firm. But it hit a rough patch under the leadership of now-departed CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor, Bob Iger, is now at the helm once more, and he has a lot of fixing to do. Profits are well below pre-Covid levels and the stock is down 35% this year, more than twice the drop in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.Then there's former high rider Under Armour (UA). It seemed poised to become the next Nike when it claimed the 2014 best-company title. But it missed the athleisure trend, lost high-profile endorsers and endured management problems. The company's value, meanwhile, has dropped from a peak of $22 billion in 2015 to less than $4 billion today.Another disappointment: Facebook (META), our 2015 winner. In 2021, Yahoo Finance readers face-palmed the company, now Meta, by voting it worst company of the year. What irked investors then was a stream of controversy over Facebook allowing bogus content on the site and/or blocking certain political points of view. This year’s woes include a wrong turn into the “metaverse,” where nobody except CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to hang out. The company laid off 11,000 workers in November, and the stock is down 67% from its 2021 peak. Once a rare trillion-dollar company, Meta is now worth less than $300 billion.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other Company of the Year setbacks?Square (SQ), our 2018 winner, began to focus on cryptocurrency a couple years later, eventually changing its name to Block—as in blockchain. From 2020 to 2021, Square/Block rode the crypto boom up. Then, this year, it rode the crypto bust right back down. Shares soared in 2021, then plunged in 2022, and they’re now around where they were before the move into crypto. Block is back to Square 1.And when we picked Zoom (ZOOM) in 2020, we wondered whether the ""meme"" darling of the COVID lockdown era would maintain its momentum once COVID faded and people went back to work. Turns out, not. Zoom had an epic year in 2020, with the stock up nearly 400%. Since then, however, it’s down 87%%. Zoom out.Some COTY winners, though, are as influential as they were when we chose them, or more so.Nvidia (2016) is now one of the nation’s foundational tech companies, with microchips that power everything from video games to artificial intelligence. Amazon (AMZN), the winner in 2017, is still the dominant online retailer, though others are catching up—including Target (TGT), our 2019 winner. Microsoft (MSFT), our 2021 winner, has fallen back to earth like most tech companies this year, yet it powers ahead with a suite of terrific franchises.Preordained greatness is not one of our criteria for selecting the Company of the Year, so we don’t mind if some of our choices lose their luster after their moment of glory. We like companies that had rewarded investors—or, as with Costco this year, punish them less than the market as a whole. We also look for companies that capture the zeitgeist, as Costco did this year by helping consumers battle inflation. And we do, of course, hope our choices remain buzzy so we can check in on them in 10 or 20 years. Costco seems likely to meet that requirement.More Yahoo Finance Company of the Year 2022 coverage:Meet Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year: CostcoHow we chose Costco to be Yahoo Finance's Company of the YearCostco stock: 5 takes from Wall Street analystsWhy some of our 'best company' picks didn't stay that wayRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

The criminal gang deploying the virus contacts the victim and demands payment in return for unscrambling the files.In March this year the ICO fined Tuckers Solicitors £98,000 for failing to “implement appropriate technical and organisational measures” on its computer networks to shut out ransomware hackers.Online criminals broke into the London-based criminal law firm’s systems and stole thousands of files, some of which were later dumped online for anyone to read.]"
