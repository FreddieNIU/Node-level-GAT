If you want to explore similar tech companies, you can also take a look at 5 Biggest Tech Companies In The World After the 2022 Stock Market Collapse.2022 has been a bad year for the stock market. What started off as minor inflation has now reached 40-year highs. The Fed's reaction to the alarmingly high inflation rate sent reverberations to the equities market and caused rampant sell-offs, with all major market indices declining. Russia's invasion of Ukraine played a role in driving the downtrend in emerging markets, and a further catalyst was the dollar, which has remained strong throughout 2022.The Worst Might Be Over, Markets Rally On Weak CPI ReportOn November 10, The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI report for October which showed signs of the economy cooling. The all-items index rose 7.7% year over year, the smallest twelve-month increase since the period ending January 2022. The all items less food and energy index recorded an increase of 6.3% year over year, the energy index rose 17.6% over the twelve months ending October, and the food index increased 10.9% over the past twelve months. All of these components declined from the numbers that came out in September. Some experts are saying inflation may have peaked and the markets rallied on a weak CPI print for October, with the S&amp;P 500 going back up to 3,900, the Dow surging to 33,400, and the Nasdaq rising to 10,900.""We Are Starting To See Some Benefits That The Fed Is Looking For""Shortly after the CPI report for October was released, Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his take on the inflation data and what to expect from the Fed moving forward. Zervos noted that the weak CPI report ""is a lot of relief"" and that now we are in a ""fine-tuning phase"" since ""we have done the heavy lifting, we have had 400 basis points done already"". For year-end, Zervos sees the Fed raising rates by another 50 basis points or potentially 75 basis points and said that ""we have a lot of QT (quantitative tightening) to get through"". Zervos noted that ""there's a lot of tightening in the hopper"" and that ""we are starting to see some benefits that the Fed is looking for"" and this is good for the markets.Story continuesTech companies have been hammered hard in 2022, and their valuations have suffered due to the higher borrowing costs.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards.

This growth will be driven by the healthcare sector turning to advanced devices such as linked thermometers to monitor patients and the growth of smart cities that provide smart metering and smart sensing.Since the IoT market will be powered by IoT devices, it is relevant to also take a look at these on their own. Fortunately, Facts &amp; Factors has a research report that covers precisely this, and the research firm believes that this segment will grow at a 10.10% CAGR between 2022 and 2028, for an estimated value of $2.7 billion by the end of the forecast period.

AER, Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. HCCI and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL.Give Your Investments a Boost with These 4 Low P/CF StocksThe U.S. economy made a sharp comeback in the third quarter, with GDP rising 2.6%, according to the ""advance"" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The positive reading on the economic front has lessened the longstanding fears of a recession, at least for the time being. Wall Street also looks a bit confident now after a dismal show in the first three quarters of 2022.But does sustained economic growth look plausible from here onward? Inflationary pressure, a rising interest rate environment and ongoing geopolitical tensions are enough to derail the momentum. We note that the consumer spending rate decelerated in the last quarter. So, while you modify your portfolio to cope with the changing market scenario and continued monetary policy tightening, market pundits are placing their bets on value stocks.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Unum Group, AerCap Holdings N.V., Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. boasts a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Story continuesAnalysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 12.2% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.9%, on average.

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Nvidia NVDA, Cisco Systems CSCO and Applied Materials AMAT.Previewing Retail Sector Earnings as Inventory Issues LingerWalmart shares have recouped a big part of the losses they suffered following the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th. The Walmart sell-off was reinforced by an even more disappointing release from Target the following day.Unlike the market’s indiscriminate negative reaction to Walmart and Target’s quarterly reports in May, it reacted favorably to Walmart’s July-quarter release on August 16th even though Target shares sold off on its quarterly report the following day.This recent history is useful to keep in mind as we look ahead to the October-quarter reports from Walmart and Target on Tuesday (11/15) and Wednesday (11/16), respectively.Part of the explanation for Walmart’s stock market stability is the nature of its business which offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart also benefits from its perceived value proposition to customers that likely prompts segments of consumers to ‘trade down’ to its stores.The big issue in the last two quarterly releases for Walmart and Target centered on rising inventory levels, which reflected the combined effects of shifting consumer behavior and moderating sales. The market seems to believe, based on its treatment of the two stocks, that Walmart is further along in addressing its inventory issue than Target.We have no reason to disprove the market’s optimism about Walmart on the inventory issue, but we can nevertheless see the stock as vulnerable to any signs of weakness in this week’s quarterly report. On the flip side, Target shares appear ‘spring loaded’ for a bounce if the company’s release Wednesday morning turns out to be ‘less bad’ than the market fears.Story continuesWith respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. The Retail sector companies that have reported already are digital vendors like Amazon or restaurant operators like McDonald’s.Unlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-alone Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 52.4% beating revenue estimates.Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the trend particularly notable on the revenues side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).This Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 350 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from a host of traditional retailers, include Nvidia, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials and others.Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all of the results that came out through Friday, November 11th, we now have Q3 results from 461 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 92.2% of the index’s total membership.For the 461 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.The EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.4% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up +1.5%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.Earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be -4.2% below the year-earlier level on +4.9% higher revenues. Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.Estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis.Since mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.1% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -10.9% on an ex-Energy basis. The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.2% since mid-April), Construction (-22.3%), Retail (-18.4%), Industrial Products (-11.9%), Consumer Discretionary (-18.1%) and Aerospace (-12.0%).There are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +3.5% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be, and current revision trends are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Making Sense of the Earnings Picture and Estimate RevisionsWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

For more companies, take a look at Top 5 Hospitality Companies in the World. The hospitality industry has started to make a strong recovery from the pandemic-era losses, even though the Russian invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation dampened the industry sentiment and created new hurdles. A research report from The Business Research Company shares that between 2021 and 2022, the global hospitality market grew from $3.9 trillion to $4.5 trillion at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9%. This rate is attributable to the aforementioned pent up demand, as the research firm believes that the same industry will grow at a much lower CAGR of 7.4% from 2022 to 2026, to be worth $6 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Another research report, this time from Market Data Forecast, has a much more optimistic CAGR for the hospitality industry. This research firm estimates that the sector will grow at a whopping 18.5% between 2022 to 2027, and from an initial value of $3.5 trillion to a whopping $4.1 trillion. Alongside an easing in coronavirus restrictions, Market Data Forecast also believes that once commodity prices drop and international travel picks up, the industry will see growing demand which will lead to revenue and capacity utilization rising. Asia Pacific and North America led the market in 2020, as they accounted for a large 70% chunk of the total revenue pie.Finally, Facts and Factors estimates that the industry was worth $3.9 trillion in 2021 and from then to 2028, it will grow at a CAGR of 10.24% to sit at an estimated $6.7 trillion by the end of the forecast period. However, it diverges from the earlier research reports and notes that Europe was the leading revenue contributor in 2021.Today's piece will take a look at the largest hospitality firms in the world, and the leading players, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), are likely to catch your eye.Story continuesTop 10 Hospitality Companies in the WorldPhoto by Gio Bartlett on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned the hospitality industry to determine which companies are operating in it and providing services.

The European Union will ban Russian crude and oil products imports on Dec. 5 and Feb. 5, respectively.""There are, of course, many concerns and much confusion regarding to the upcoming price cap, but people think the December-arriving cargoes should be safe (to buy),"" a China-based trader said.About five to seven December-loading ESPO Blend cargoes have been sold to Chinese end users, a fraction of the average of about 30 shipments Russia exports each month, traders said.Deals were last heard at around $1.70 to $1.90 a barrel above February ICE Brent on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis, falling from premiums of about $2.70 a barrel two weeks ago amid slow trade, they said. That was also lower than premiums of about $2 a barrel for November cargoes.""Everything is under the radar now. It's hard to drill down the terms and conditions agreed for those small number of transactions,"" said a Chinese trading executive.Buyers are watching out for possible impact on payment mechanism, availability of ships and shipping insurance from the G7 plan to impose a price cap to curb Moscow's oil revenue. Moscow has threatened to halt exports to countries participating in the plan.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the Russian oil price cap will benefit China and India.Some independent refiners have bought alternative supplies from Brazil and West Africa to hedge against Russian oil disruption in December, despite higher prices, traders said, as they ramp up output post-maintenance.Story continuesOperating rates at independent refiners have climbed to about 64% in early November, from 58% two months ago, data from Zhuochuang consultancy showed.""It's better to secure some cargoes, just in case Russian supply is not sustainable,"" a Shandong-based oil trader said.URALSMeanwhile, state refiners are winding down Russian Urals crude purchases for December arrival to eschew sanction risks after stockpiling the oil in previous two months, traders said.October Urals shipments into China were estimated at 235,000 barrels per day to 340,000 bpd, majority of which were bought by state-run firms such as Unipec, Zhenhua Oil and Chinaoil, according to tanker trackers Kpler and Vortexa Analytics.That would be the highest volume in two years, said Vortexa's China analyst Emma Li, adding that state firms accounted for 85%, three times their average during the first nine months.For supplies loading post Dec. 5, state firms were still weighing risks of sanctions versus the need to secure supplies.Spot discounts for these cargoes ""need to be deep enough to warrant any meaningful risk taking"", said the state oil trading manager.(Reporting by Muyu Xu and Chen Aizhu; Editing by Florence Tan and Lincoln Feast)]"

The group, which recently cut production targets, will remain cautious, the energy minister for Saudi Arabia, the OPEC+ de-facto leader, was quoted as saying last week.Next year, OPEC expects oil demand to rise by 2.24 million bpd, also 100,000 bpd lower than previously forecast.Despite commenting on the rising challenges, OPEC left its 2022 and 2023 global economic growth forecasts steady and said while risks were skewed to the downside, there was also upside potential.""This may come from a variety of sources. Predominantly, inflation could be positively impacted by any resolution of the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe, allowing for less hawkish monetary policies,"" OPEC said.Oil maintained a decline after the report was released, trading around $95 a barrel.MOVE TO SURPLUSFor October, with oil prices weakening on recession fears, the group made a 100,000 bpd cut to the OPEC+ production target, with an even bigger reduction starting in November.Saudi Arabia said the latest cut was necessary to respond to rising interest rates in the West and a weaker global economy. U.S. President Joe Biden criticised the decision, calling it shortsighted.Story continuesOPEC said in Monday's report that in the second and third quarters of this year, global oil supply outpaced total oil demand by 200,000 bpd and 1.1 million bpd respectively, having been in a deficit of 300,000 bpd in the first quarter.OPEC said its output in October fell by 210,000 bpd to 29.49 million bpd, more than the pledged OPEC+ reduction, led by a 149,000 bpd cut by Saudi Arabia. The figures are compiled by OPEC using secondary sources.Saudi Arabia itself, however, reported to OPEC a smaller drop of 84,000 bpd, bringing its October output to a shade below 11 million bpd.(Reporting by Alex LawlerEditing by David Goodman and Susan Fenton)]"

(Reuters) - Northern Colorado's biggest oil producing region is emerging as a test case for energy companies hoping to tackle the industry's most pressing regulatory and environmental problems: capping old wells that leak climate-warming methane and other emissions.In this farming community, oil giant Chevron Corp is sending crews as part of a state-wide push to seal leaks. Once wells are plugged with cement and equipment is removed, workers restore the land to its original state.Colorado, the fifth largest U.S. oil-producing state, has been in the forefront of anti-drilling sentiment spreading across the country. Voters have set limits to operations near homes and schools, banned routine burning of unwanted gas, and imposed restrictions on fracking chemicals.Energy companies are being urged to reduce emissions by cities, investors and governments. Federal rules that will require them to monitor and report on climate-warming methane emissions from larger wells are expected early next year.Last week, U.S. officials pledged to expand those rules to require firms to find and plug leaks from every well no matter how small, and to respond to any complaints of high-volume leaks.Chevron Corp is running 16 ""workover rigs"" that do well removal. It plans to deconstruct and plug some 500 old wells in Colorado each year. That work, along with new equipment to clean oil operations, will reduce greenhouse emissions by about 100,000 U.S tons a year, the company said, roughly the same as 21,7000 cars.Chevron estimates it spends between $80,000 to $100,000 apiece to plug and remove a well and leftover gear.'EVOLUTION' IN DRILLINGSince 2016, Chevron has removed 3,400 wells in the state and aims to do another 2,200 over the coming years, part of its effort to make oilfields more green. Companies are also employing electric- instead of diesel-powered rigs, eliminating routine flaring and piping production instead of using heavy trucks.Story continues""We've got lower emissions, we have lower ground disturbance. So this is just part of that evolution of what we're doing out here,"" said Hodge Walker, vice president of Chevron's Rockies Business unit.Critics say these initiatives are ""green-washing"" that encourage more fossil fuel production that leads to more emissions.Plugging old wells could also become big business for energy and service firms given the sheer number of abandoned wells and $1.15 billion in federal funding being made available to states to seal them.In parts of Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, natural gas producer Diversified Energy turned its in-house well-plugging unit into a for-profit business. It also removed some 90 of its own at a cost of about $21,000 each in the first half of 2022. It now aims to cap 200 of its own wells per year.Such plugging program have comforted investors by addressing wells that could endanger the public and become a liability, said Diversified CEO Rusty Hutson.But now, he sees a sizeable business from state and federal monies directed to stopping methane leaks. The operation will have 15 rigs and has already won contracts from West Virginia and Ohio to plug orphaned wells that have no identified owners and can leak methane.Environmentalists say the efforts are overdue.""We learn to clean up our own messes in kindergarten. This isn't something that deserves applause, it should be expected,"" said Anne Lee Foster, a Colorado environmental activist.She initially said Colorado taxpayers have spent about $5 million a year since 2018 to subsidize the cleaning up of abandoned wells, but later revised her statement to clarify the money comes from a fee on oil and gas operators.RESTORING FARMLANDOn a sunny October day, a Chevron crew in Kersey was mid-way through removing a well drilled in 1992 on 78-year-old Bill Klein's farmland.The well, called the Patriot 16-12, is a vertical well that pre-dates the shale oil revolution where new drilling techniques helped propel the U.S. into a world-leading oil and gas producer.""I've never had any problem with the oil companies,"" says Klein, who for 57 years has owned land around where Patriot 16-12 operated and has collected royalties from oil and gas drilling. He plans to re-farm the land once the wells are safely plugged.That does not mean the oil industry is walking away from Kersey. Several hundred feet from Chevron's plugging work, PDC Energy Inc. is drilling a new, horizontal well, which can span over 2 miles underground.PDC Energy and Chevron regularly share drilling plans to avoid potential collisions that could provide a way for methane to reach the surface.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Kersey, Colorado; Editing by Anna Driver)]"

What started off as minor inflation has now reached 40-year highs. The Fed's reaction to the alarmingly high inflation rate sent reverberations to the equities market and caused rampant sell-offs, with all major market indices declining. Russia's invasion of Ukraine played a role in driving the downtrend in emerging markets, and a further catalyst was the dollar, which has remained strong throughout 2022.The Worst Might Be Over, Markets Rally On Weak CPI ReportOn November 10, The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI report for October which showed signs of the economy cooling. The all-items index rose 7.7% year over year, the smallest twelve-month increase since the period ending January 2022. The all items less food and energy index recorded an increase of 6.3% year over year, the energy index rose 17.6% over the twelve months ending October, and the food index increased 10.9% over the past twelve months. All of these components declined from the numbers that came out in September. Some experts are saying inflation may have peaked and the markets rallied on a weak CPI print for October, with the S&amp;P 500 going back up to 3,900, the Dow surging to 33,400, and the Nasdaq rising to 10,900.""We Are Starting To See Some Benefits That The Fed Is Looking For""Shortly after the CPI report for October was released, Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his take on the inflation data and what to expect from the Fed moving forward. Zervos noted that the weak CPI report ""is a lot of relief"" and that now we are in a ""fine-tuning phase"" since ""we have done the heavy lifting, we have had 400 basis points done already"". For year-end, Zervos sees the Fed raising rates by another 50 basis points or potentially 75 basis points and said that ""we have a lot of QT (quantitative tightening) to get through"". Zervos noted that ""there's a lot of tightening in the hopper"" and that ""we are starting to see some benefits that the Fed is looking for"" and this is good for the markets.Story continuesTech companies have been hammered hard in 2022, and their valuations have suffered due to the higher borrowing costs.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards.

But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles.We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy. We also see significant room for margin expansion. While we have trimmed our Salesforce (CRM) exposure, we maintain confidence that the stock will rerate to a level that reflects its growth potential.”10.

ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”6.

Healthcare companies saw the need to create or fill the position to help with product and service development, while non-health companies required a clinician for operational and employee health management needs.For some, it was a pivot from a position they already held. For others, it was a career shift altogether.“The reality is, I am the inaugural chief medical officer of this organization. And I am not alone in that fate,” said Antonio Tataranni, chief officer of health and wellness at PepsiCo (PEP). “There have been moments where the weight of the responsibility has been large,” he added.The sudden surge in responsibility for CMOs forged an unofficial roundtable inside corporate America, including Tataranni.Live camera footage of a patient hospitalised with COVID-19 is shown from a computer monitor during a daily meeting lead by Dr. Joseph Varon (not pictured), the chief medical officer at United Memorial Medical Center (UMMC) (REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare)Known informally as the U.S. Roundtable of Chief Medical Officers — which could change as the group hopes to go global —the new crop of C-suite doctors banded together and continue sharing their expertise and information based on the latest data and projections.There are currently about 20 chief medical officers who are part of this group, from industries like airlines, technology, consumer goods, academia, pharmaceutical, and retail. Since it isn't an official group, the companies declined to be named.Breakneck speedOne of the biggest responsibilities these medical experts had included fighting misinformation and disinformation, as well as advising executives on operational decisions.Story continuesDelta’s (DAL) chief health and well-being officer, Dr. Henry Ting said he never thought he’d ever be working for a company, much less an airline. But he was still able to maneuver the new role.“This was sort of an existential threat to Delta airlines, in terms of duration and severity,"" Ting said. ""Our revenue and passenger rides dropping 95% in 30 days, almost the opposite of what Lysol (RBGLY) and Purell saw.""So Ting formed a strategic relationship with all of Delta’s executives and began the process of trying to look four weeks ahead and decide how the company should operate at all levels. That led to decisions like blocking the middle seat on flights, to changed HEPA filters or setting up testing and vaccine sites for employees.Deloitte's Ken Abrams executed a different strategy, but one that was equally inclusive. Abrams found himself needing to ""educate a group of people who never ever in their lives imagined that they were going to need a science-based education.""Sanathan Aiyadurai, 27, and Diego Montelongo, 27, who are medical students, review a COVID-19 patient's status during a daily meeting lead by Dr. Joseph Varon, 58, the chief medical officer at United Memorial Medical Center (UMMC) REUTERS/Callaghan O'HareThe team built a mini medical school program to help educate executive leadership about immunology, physiology, virology, and epidemiology.Information and vaccine accessPepsi, like other large multinational corporations, had one key advantage in gaining knowledge about the virus — it operates in hundreds of countries. So when waves of Covid hit different parts of the world, Pepsi had eyes on the ground to understand the situation, and how to respond accordingly.“It was very clear that information was developing at a breakneck speed, and differently in different parts of the world,” Pepsi's Tataranni, who is also senior vice president of life sciences, said.“In the very beginning, our Chinese colleagues were really the coaches that were telling us (what would) happen,"" he said.Over time, the local teams were allowed to decide how to handle the situation on the ground during surges. Sometimes, the role went beyond keeping abreast of the latest information. In some cases, Pepsi found itself at the center of the vaccine acquisition battles globally.“At some point, some of the more money-strapped governments started reaching out to a private corporation, especially at the time of deployment of vaccines. So we had to navigate a little bit of the vaccine diplomacy,” Tataranni said.All of these were beyond the normal experiences for a former endocrinologist who was hired to head Pepsi’s research and development.But the workload didn’t end there. Tataranni also found himself in the interviewer’s chair, launching a Q&amp;A series with experts that was broadcast internally and available for all employees internationally.Chief clinical officer John Corman MD at Virginia Mason administers a dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at the Amazon Meeting Center in downtown Seattle, Washington on January 24, 2021. (Photo by Grant HINDSLEY / AFP) (Photo by GRANT HINDSLEY/AFP via Getty Images)Ting also had a range of sources. He relied on his peer network developed over years at large clinical systems as he maneuvered being able to balance the business and operations with the science. That included contacts at the CDC, Emory, Stanford, Mass General, and Mayo Clinic.“Sometimes the science is not always so clear, or black and white. In fact, usually, it isn’t. Particularly in something like Covid, where everything was a curveball, and you never knew what was around the corner,” he said.That’s where Ting sees the future of the CMO role in companies. Where once, doctors that held the role were more occupational health advisers, they are now advising the entire C-suite on operations. And that, Ting said, has elevated the role to a point where it is likely to remain.Long term impactSalesforce (CRM) chief medical officer Geeta Nayyar said the trust and relationships built during the pandemic will lend themselves to more impactful efforts of keeping employees healthy.""Companies want to do exactly what we're doing which is make their employees smart about health care, and it's expensive. Health care is a huge cost on the balance sheet,"" Nayyar said.Kroger's (KR) chief medical officer, Marc Watkins, who has been in the role since 2018, sees only growth in the near future.""I don't think employers today are going to move away from chief physician executive or chief medical officer roles if they can add them at this point. Just because of the uncertainty moving out of the pandemic,"" Watkins said.""Given what you're seeing in the market with them hiring or non-traditional organization bring on physician leadership, I feel like we see that continue. It won't be business as usual,"" he added.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

We don’t know if it’s already in or if more pain is coming. What we do know is that there are stocks to buy in the meantime. Specifically, there are stocks to buy now before the market bottoms.There are plenty of high-quality, blue-chip stocks that are being battered right now. That’s particularly true in tech, as this group has come under strong selling pressure.While many sectors and industries continue to do well — or at least hold — there’s a clear recession in tech. Many companies are undergoing job layoffs and hiring pauses. The concern is palpable within this group, particularly as mega-cap tech finally comes under pressure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s look for bargains as the market pain seems set to reverse.TickerCompanyPriceGOOGL, GOOGAlphabet$93.54, $93.70MSFTMicrosoft$239.66CRMSalesforce$154.13Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comI have been writing about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) a lot lately, but it’s hard not to. Admittedly, the business is under pressure as digital-ad spending continues to drop. That’s as companies bear down ahead of a potential recession and look to preserve their finances.That said, Alphabet stock is still forecast to grow revenue by 10% this year and 9% in 2023.Further, the company owns the two most popular websites in the world, Google.com, and YouTube.com, respectively. I like to refer to these as the internet’s Boardwalk and Park Place.Despite the reduction in growth, Alphabet should be just fine. It boasts more than $116 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Further, the stock trades at 18.5 times this year’s earnings and 16 times next year’s estimates. That’s as the stock has suffered a 45% decline, its worst fall since the Great Recession.We could see lower prices for Alphabet — potentially into the $75 to $80 area — but generally speaking, it looks attractive below $90.Story continuesMicrosoft (MSFT)In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) productsSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comLike Alphabet, I’ve written much about Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) lately, but allow me to humor you for a moment.If you don’t believe me, look at the long-term numbers. The market moves in big cycles. It enjoys long secular bull markets, then painful but generally shorter bear markets. When the bull market re-emerges — and it will — it will likely have new leaders that drive it to the upside. New stocks become large-cap holdings, then mega-cap holdings like Microsoft today.That doesn’t mean Microsoft, Alphabet, and the others have to die off or become International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). It just means they will not likely be the next 1,000% gainers over the next decade.However, that also doesn’t mean they are not stocks to buy now.Microsoft stock was down about 39% at its low, marking its worst decline since the Great Recession. I’m sorry, but I’m a buyer when a high-quality, blue-chip company falls ~40% from the highs.This company has better operating margins than all of FAANG, and outside of this year — where it still has positive earnings and revenue growth — it’s forecast to generate double-digit top-and-bottom-line growth for three straight years through FY 2026.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San FranciscoSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) comes with a caveat here because I would love to get my hands on this stock in the $115 to $120 area. Currently trading in the mid-$140s (as of writing), I’m not sure if we will get that opportunity. I hope that we will because Salesforce is quickly becoming a value stock.I will admit, listening to the conference calls of other cloud-based companies and some of the pressures we’re seeing in B2B spending among tech — and based on commentary from Salesforce last quarter — I do expect some pressure in its business.That said, analysts forecast flat earnings growth this year on 17% revenue growth. Beyond that, analysts’ estimates for both earnings and revenue are incredibly attractive over the next few years.While this company seems to have become the face of “overvalued stocks” in years past, that’s not so much the case anymore. Shares trade just under 30 times this year’s earnings and 26.5 times next year’s estimates.Lastly, if we see the stock trade at $120 and estimates stay the same, those valuations drop to 25 times and 21 times, respectively.

The Federal Reserve just raised interest rates 75 basis points, its fourth such consecutive increase, and Jerome Powell signaled more trouble ahead. Although Powell suggested smaller incremental increases ahead he also stated rates could rise to higher levels than previously anticipated. That suggests inflation worries will be more persistent and that turmoil in the markets is far from over.None of that even considers the rising likelihood of a 2023 recession. Greater numbers of influential voices are conceding that a 2023 recession is coming. None of the above suggests tech will run sharply higher for any sustained period of time.That said, there are still cheap tech stocks worth buying. One can argue that many inexpensive tech stocks currently have worst-case scenarios priced in. Therefore, they are likely to fall much farther. Let’s look at some of those equities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCheap Tech Stocks: Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comOn the one hand, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock is at the forefront of the global economic downturn. The semiconductor manufacturing equipment, services, and software provider has suffered this year. Inflation and slowing global growth have crushed demand for big-ticket items that include all things semiconductors. Not good for Applied Technologies and AMAT stock. That has resulted in the company revising guidance downward. Case in point, on Oct. 12 it revised its upcoming guidance downward from $6.65 billion to $6.4 billion.One of the simplest, and most compelling arguments in favor of AMAT stock is its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. At 13.76, it ranks better than roughly 60% of industry competitors which have a median of 15.5. Applied Materials’ P/E ratio is well below its 10-year median as well. That’s true of everything as valuations have plummeted with rising interest rates. But it remains a positive nonetheless.Story continuesThe other compelling aspect of AMAT stock is that it provides a dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 2005. In short, AMAT is a defensive stock among tech names given the income its dividend provides.Seagate Technology (STX)A Seagate Technology (STX) sign hanging above an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) stock represents the Dublin-based data storage products and services firm. It is worth buying for many of the same reasons that Applied Materials is worth buying.Like AMAT stock, STX stock includes a dividend. However, Seagate’s dividend yields a much higher 5.77% at present. That would be considered high in most industries.  It is particularly high in growth-oriented tech stocks that rarely pay dividends, period.Interestingly, Seagate has not slashed that dividend for more than a decade either.Revenue declined from $3.115 billion to $2.035 billion in the most recent quarter. Net income fell from $526 million to $29 million in the same period. The company is restructuring as a result. It is laying off 8% of its workforce. It expects the move to cost as much as $70 million resulting in $110 million in overall savings. Essentially, any current investor is betting Seagate will come out leaner and meaner while relying on its high-flying dividend to ease their worries.Cheap Tech Stocks: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock, like the two above, also includes a dividend. The same defensive argument applies to it as well. The company’s size, importance, and fundamentals make it worth buying. Fortunately, it’s cheap right now. That’s the collective opinion of Wall Street. Of the 36 analysts with coverage, 30 have given it a buy rating. Its current price is $60 and it carries a target price above $86. In short, analysts expect it to appreciate 43.54% over the next year to year-and-a-half.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest foundry. Its 5-nanometer process technology makes it a leader as other firms can’t keep up. It launched limited 3-nanometer chips as well. South Korea’s Samsung is the only other competitor in the space so far.The U.S. is trying to onshore chip production as Taiwan-China-U.S. tensions rise. But the safe bet is to assume TSMC will continue to dominate and play a major role. Its technological prowess and scale make that a near certainty. Further, U.S. firms won’t be able to replicate the manpower advantages Asian firms have. Thus, TSM remains a safe bet.Chegg (CHGG)Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comChegg (NYSE:CHGG) and its stock have had a whirlwind 6-month period. In early May, the outlook for the online-learning platform operator was bleak. Back then, it appeared that students were choosing jobs over college. CEO Dan Rosensweig warned that people would focus less on training as inflation worries mounted. He lowered profit guidance by $35 million, and CHGG stock plummeted as a result. At the same time, Rosensweig noted he expected the trend to be temporary.Fast forward six months, and looks to be the case. Q3 earnings, released in early November, surprised investors positively. Revenue reached $164.7 million beating the $158.3 The firm’s EBITDA reached $50 million, well above the $37.1 million Wall Street expected.On top of that, subscriber numbers jumped 9% on a year-over-year basis. Chegg is near its target price currently. However, the company has provided earnings beats in each of the past four quarters. If it continues to do so, analysts will revise upward and prices should rise overall.Cheap Tech Stocks: Hackett Group (HCKT)Business adviser meeting to analyze and discuss the situation on the financial report in the meeting room. Investment Consultant, financial consultant, financial advisor and accounting conceptThe Hackett Group (NASDAQ:HCKT) and its stock are relatively unknown. The company engages in business and technology consulting and has strong fundamentals behind it. Its Q2 earnings, combined with a few fundamental metrics, make it worth considering.Further, it has a strong upside potential of 40% based on its target price and current price.Hackett Group posted Q2 revenue of $75.9 million. That represented a 4% increase and exceeded the high end of guidance. Those results were impressive in and of themselves. But Hackett Group also boasts other notable characteristics. The firm has no outstanding debt and a cash balance of $61.7 million. In short, it remains flexible and highly solvent.Further, Hackett Group is exceptionally strong at investing capital. Its return on invested capital is 33.74%. That’s better than 93% of industry competitors and far higher than its 5.74% cost of capital. In short, the company turns invested capital into much greater amounts of capital.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockIt’s been a wild ride for Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock and shareholders over the past year. Share prices have ranged from as high as $699 to as low as $274. Shares of the digital marketing giant currently trade for $326. Wall Street is wavering on its prospects, but give it a target price of $364.93 at the same time. One current catalyst for the company is its planned acquisition of Figma. The $20 billion deal is facing scrutiny as Department of Justice (DOJ) regulators weigh competition and monopoly considerations.Adobe, as could be expected, stated the two are not competitors. The company remains steadfast in its belief that a merger will occur in 2023.So, ADBE stock has every chance to move upward if and when the Figma deal happens. The company has been extremely profitable over the past 10 years. It will continue to see high margins on the digital products its sells and that makes it valuable despite rising interest rates.Cheap Tech Stocks: Yalla Group (YALA)Yalla Group (YALA) Voice Chat Rooms mobile app logo on phone screen close up, Illustrative Editorial.Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comYalla Group (NYSE:YALA) stock is a relatively fast-growing, cheap tech play that is profitable. The Dubai-based firm operates a voice-centric social and entertainment platform. The fundamentals underpinning the company are very good. Revenues reached $76.1 million in Q2, up 14.2% YoY. That’s not particularly surprising given that tech growth firms often report similar numbers. What may surprise investors is that the company recorded a positive net income of $20.353 million. That represented a nearly $2 million increase on a year-over-year basis.The company is dealing with increasing costs that continue to drive income lower. However, it continues to post similar net income in a growth-first tech sector where income is not a given.The stock is cheap based on a P/E ratio of about eight which makes it far less expensive than its competition. The company saw its monthly average user base increase from just over 22k to nearly 30k in Q2 while paying users increased overall and as a percentage.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

AEP, PG&amp;E Corporation PCG, Consolidated Edison ED and NRG Energy, Inc.  Inc. NRG.Industry: Electric UtilityLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2017142/4-electric-power-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-industryThe Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks continue their transition toward clean sources of fuel and focus on lower carbon emissions. Utilities are benefiting from rate hikes and efficient cost management. The utility stocks are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Co., with a large investment to expand renewable operations, its widespread transmission and distribution assets, and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include PG&amp;E Corporation, Consolidated Edison and NRG Energy, Inc.  Inc.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles.A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward the cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 20% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 and 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 38 GW and 54 GW to be added in 2022 and 2023, respectively.The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation, and EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and further to 19% in 2023. EIA also expects the share of natural gas in power generation to drop from 38% in 2022 to 36% in 2023. The government is helping to increase the usage of renewable energy through tax credits, and operators are cutting down emissions on their own, intending to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Demand For Electricity Can Decline: Per EIA, 2023 electricity generation in the United States can drop 2% from the 2022 levels due to a decline in demand. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 will be due to a cooler temperature forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling and slight economic contraction. Despite the expected drop in demand, the addition of new renewable energy assets in the total generation portfolio will continue.Ongoing Increase Rate is a Concern: Utilities to maintain, upgrade and expand operations to approach the capital markets for loans to fund their capital projects.  Utilities regularly distribute dividend from their profits and don’t necessarily have enough retained profits to fund capital projects. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years, but with six hikes have now pushed the benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, and more rate hikes are likely in the future.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as they will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers, but the necessary raise in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Energy Stock Picks.Ray Dalio is an American billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds. Dalio is also a noted economic commentator and has written extensively on finance and investing. According to Forbes, Mr. Dalio's real-time net worth is $19.1 billion.The ""Three Big Things"" And Where To Invest According To Ray DalioOn October 12, Ray Dalio appeared in an interview on Bloomberg where he discussed the latest economic situation. According to Mr. Dalio, the U.S. economy is facing ""three big things"". The first is ""the amount of debt and money creation"", and according to Mr. Dalio, central banks have not printed money ""to this degree"" except for the period between 1930 and 1945. The second ""big thing"" is ""the amount of internal conflict"", and Mr. Dalio noted that the U.S. has the largest internal wealth gaps since the period between 1930 and 1945. The third challenge the U.S. economy is faced with is ""international conflict"" and the rising competition from China. Ray Dalio also spoke about the Fed's actions in 2022 and his view of the current situation of the U.S. economy. Mr. Dalio noted that increasing the money supply in the economy ""is stimulative over the short run and depressing over the long run"" since quantitative easing is followed by quantitative tightening. Mr. Dalio noted that ""the Fed and the government have given an enormous amount of debt and credit and created a lurch forward, a giant lurch forward, and created a bubble. And now they are putting on the breaks."" According to Mr. Dalio, the Fed is ""trying to navigate"" between sustainably high inflation and a significant weakening of the economy, and this ""will probably be something like the 70s"". Further, Mr. Dalio spoke about where he would park his cash amid the current economic situation. Here are some comments from Mr. Dalio:Story continues""If I was saving, what would I want to save in? I would like to save in the things that I know I am going to need. So I would like to save in my residence, my house. I would like to save, if I could, pay forward my kid's education, pay forward the food or the healthcare that I can, and so on. I would want to save in those things, to buy forward the things I need most fundamentally.""This article will discuss in detail some of Ray Dalio's top energy stock picks which include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Our MethodologyTo determine billionaire Ray Dalio's top 10 energy stock picks, we reviewed Bridgewater Associates' 13F filings that were updated at the close of the third quarter of 2022. We picked the top 10 energy stocks from Ray Dalio's Q3 2022 investment portfolio and arranged them according to Bridgewater Associates' stake in them.

Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $14,357,000Percentage of Bridgewater Associates' 13F Portfolio: 0.07%Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the United States. As of November 11, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has gained 57.56% year to date and is trading at a PE multiple of 7x.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”Some of billionaire Ray Dalio's top energy stock picks include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).9.

What started off as minor inflation has now reached 40-year highs. The Fed's reaction to the alarmingly high inflation rate sent reverberations to the equities market and caused rampant sell-offs, with all major market indices declining. Russia's invasion of Ukraine played a role in driving the downtrend in emerging markets, and a further catalyst was the dollar, which has remained strong throughout 2022.The Worst Might Be Over, Markets Rally On Weak CPI ReportOn November 10, The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI report for October which showed signs of the economy cooling. The all-items index rose 7.7% year over year, the smallest twelve-month increase since the period ending January 2022. The all items less food and energy index recorded an increase of 6.3% year over year, the energy index rose 17.6% over the twelve months ending October, and the food index increased 10.9% over the past twelve months. All of these components declined from the numbers that came out in September. Some experts are saying inflation may have peaked and the markets rallied on a weak CPI print for October, with the S&amp;P 500 going back up to 3,900, the Dow surging to 33,400, and the Nasdaq rising to 10,900.""We Are Starting To See Some Benefits That The Fed Is Looking For""Shortly after the CPI report for October was released, Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his take on the inflation data and what to expect from the Fed moving forward. Zervos noted that the weak CPI report ""is a lot of relief"" and that now we are in a ""fine-tuning phase"" since ""we have done the heavy lifting, we have had 400 basis points done already"". For year-end, Zervos sees the Fed raising rates by another 50 basis points or potentially 75 basis points and said that ""we have a lot of QT (quantitative tightening) to get through"". Zervos noted that ""there's a lot of tightening in the hopper"" and that ""we are starting to see some benefits that the Fed is looking for"" and this is good for the markets.Story continuesTech companies have been hammered hard in 2022, and their valuations have suffered due to the higher borrowing costs.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business.

Adding to the uncertainty, recent midterm elections failed to deliver a clear mandate for either party. Investors are rightfully nervous about how the market will look going into 2023. Those looking to sleep well at night regardless of the latest political and economic developments should consider investing in dividend stocks for passive income.In a downturn, you might reasonably question how safe a company’s payout is given the worsening economic outlook. However, all seven of the names below are Dividend Aristocrats, meaning they have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 consecutive years — a period covering the dot-com bust and the Great Recession. In other words, these companies have proven they can prosper in difficult times and not just maintain, but increase their dividend. So, there’s a good chance they can weather the current turmoil as well.The names on today’s list of the best dividend stocks for passive income all have a yield of at least 3%, offering a strong starting point in addition to any future dividend increases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsXOMExxon Mobil$110.50IBMInternational Business Machines$141.23VFCV.F.

Investors hoping for a so-called red wave were disappointed as Republicans failed to notch some expected wins. This, in turn, may bring a tougher regulatory environment for oil and gas companies for at least the next two years.Investors shouldn’t be too worried, though. For one, Exxon Mobil has always operated on a generational time frame. The company is known for investing on a decades-long timescale and consistently puts capital to work when others are shying away. This contrarian streak showed itself, for example, when Exxon Mobil kept investing in its huge offshore Guyana field even as rivals slashed new oil and gas production spending. Once the price of oil surged again in 2021, the successful Guyana bet put Exxon Mobil in the driver’s seat among major international oil producers.Story continuesAll that to say that short-term regulatory developments during one congressional term aren’t enough to meaningfully slow Exxon Mobil down. Additionally, more regulation could lead to less output, and, in turn, higher prices. Further government efforts to restrict new oil and gas production could, counterintuitively, make Exxon Mobil’s existing production capacity even more valuable.In any case, XOM stock is a steal here trading at 9.3 times earnings with a current dividend yield of 3.3%.IBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAfter a decade of watching mega-cap technology stocks soar, it would have seemed crazy to think about buying IBM (NYSE:IBM). After all, the staid technology company seemed to have missed major technological trends and was struggling to maintain even flat revenue while the rest of the tech sector soared. With 2022’s turn of events, however, IBM’s appeal has returned.Simply put, IBM stock is so cheap that it doesn’t rely on future growth or high expectations. The company’s primary lines of business in providing tech consulting, information technology services and the like are not fast-moving, but they are consistent. IBM has established deep, persistent relationships, in many cases spanning decades, with leading Fortune 500 companies. These don’t go away overnight.IBM is far from dynamic at this point, but simply keeping the ship steady is enough with shares yielding 4.8%. Meanwhile, don’t discount future growth. The Red Hat acquisition greatly broadened IBM’s push into the hybrid cloud. Indeed, IBM’s cloud computing offering, while trailing the big three, has gained some traction with major customers in recent quarters.IBM has its issues, but those are fully reflected in its bargain valuation.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comV.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a large apparel company that owns more than a dozen different brands and trademarks, including Vans, The North Face, Dickies, Timberland and JanSport. V.F. covers a wide variety of demographics but is particularly focused on leisure and outdoor apparel.Investors may rightly shy away from apparel stocks given that this tends to be a cutthroat industry with thin profit margins subject to fickle consumer tastes. However, V.F.’s unique approach reduces this risk. The company’s large stable of different brands helps ensure that there is something that is always on-trend and gaining appeal with consumers at any given time. Right now, for example, while Vans is in a slump, The North Face products are selling well.VFC stock has lost 70% of its value since hitting its all-time high above $100 in early 2020. Profits have dipped a bit in 2022 as consumer spending has started to roll over and inventory levels have mounted. Regardless, the market has overreacted. V.F. Corporation has been through recessions before and can make it through this one as well.With its most recent dividend hike in October, V.F. Corporation left the Dividend Aristocrats and became a Dividend King — a company that has increased its annual payout for 5o or more consecutive years. VFC stock currently yields 7.6%.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) finds itself in a similar situation to Exxon Mobil, with some investors selling off shares thanks to the recent election results. However, long-term investors can profit from the political jitters. The truth is that profits for the major oil and gas producers with a global operations footprint simply aren’t that impacted by minor regulatory changes in the United States, at least not in the short run.Meanwhile, the world needs more energy. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a good deal of oil and natural gas supplies have gone off the market. This makes it much harder for continental Europe to power itself. Demand for liquified natural gas, or LNG, has soared to help ensure that the lights stay on and people stay warm during the harsh European winter.CVX stock is trading near its all-time high, which might make investors think they’ve missed the opportunity. Yet, shares still trade for less than 11.5 times forward earnings and offer a 3.2% dividend yield. And earnings should continue to grow thanks to strong energy demand along with the company’s share buyback program, which increases the amount of earnings per remaining outstanding share.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comClorox (NYSE:CLX) surprised a lot of investors over the past few years. Typically, people think of consumer staples stocks as being among the most consistent and least volatile. Yet, between November 2019 and August 2020, CLX stock soared as much as 66% as people rushed to stock up on cleaning supplies amid the early months of the pandemic.But it soon became clear people had way more bleach and other products than they could use in any reasonable time frame. This led to a slump in Clorox’s product sales as people simply haven’t needed to keep buying as many cleaning goods lately. Throw in inflation and supply chain issues and Clorox has gone from boom to bust in record time. Today, shares are once again trading at pre-pandemic levels.However, this downturn won’t last forever. Ultimately, sales of bleach and its other products will return to normal pre-pandemic levels and Clorox will get its profit margins back to typical levels. Meanwhile, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures will cool off sooner or later. And Clorox has been pushing through price hikes that will raise revenue considerably going forward.All told, investors can pick up this classic defensive blue-chip company at a discounted price thanks to the temporary earnings shortfall. And they can take comfort in the stock’s 3.4% yield while they wait.Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a fellow consumer staples company that has faced a similar trajectory to Clorox. Kimberly-Clark’s outlook soared in 2020 as people raced to pick up additional toilet paper and bathroom supplies at the start of the pandemic. However, as the rate at which people use toilet paper, soap and other such essentials didn’t actually change much, this sales lift quickly disappeared. Throw in a major inflationary wave, and Kimberly-Clark’s earnings have come up short of expectations.But the company should have a swift road to recovery. When the cost of key inputs, such as wood pulp, stabilizes, it will put the company on better near-term footing. In the meantime, management continues to raise prices to offset the effect of higher costs.Analysts forecast the company’s earnings will decline 9% in 2022 to $5.62 per share, but the decline should be short-lived. As demand normalizes, earnings should come back quickly. Analysts predict a 12.6% earnings jump to $6.33 per share next year, which would result in a forward P/E ratio of 20.2 for this quality blue chip source of passive income. KMB stock currently yields 3.7%.Dividend Stocks for Passive Income: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has a compelling message for dividend stock investors: It labeled itself “The Monthly Dividend Company.” Realty has paid a monthly dividend since 1994 and is known for raising that payout amount several times each year.How does Realty Income manage to provide investors with a strong, consistent yield? It is a real estate investment trust and one specifically in the triple net lease category. These tend to be lower risk for landlords since the tenants are responsible for major expenses such as utilities.Like most other areas of the market, REITs have come under significant pressure in 2022. This is because they are tied to interest rates. Investors tend to demand a higher dividend yield from their REITs when the interest rates on comparable fixed-income alternatives such as government Treasury bonds increase. However, this is not a reflection of the quality of Realty Income’s business and has more to do with broader market conditions.In any case, Realty Income has increased its dividend for more than 25 years in a row, and it has good odds of making it through the current downturn without any major disruption in the business plan. Shares currently yield 4.7%.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in IBM, VFC, and XOM stock.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Archer Daniels Midland, OI Glass, Applied Industrial Technologies, RPM International and W&amp;T Offshore are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects, and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesHere are our five picks of the 42 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. The company has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.

In April, the company acquired the remaining working interests in the producing properties of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from an undisclosed seller. For 2022, W&amp;T Offshore revised its average daily oil-equivalent production upward to 39.5-42 MBoe/d from 38.2-42.2 MBoe/d mentioned earlier. The metric suggests an improvement from 38.1 MBoe/d reported last year. Higher production will likely boost the company’s bottom line.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for W&amp;T Offshore’s 2022 earnings has remained steady at $1.95 per share in the past 30 days.

The company is poised to benefit from improving demand for its products and solutions along with healthy cross-selling actions and growth investments.Strength across mining, metals, agriculture, chemicals, technology, food &amp; beverage, and machinery markets are benefiting its Engineered Solutions segment. The company will likely benefit from its focus on improving the product line, value-added services and initiatives to drive operational excellence as well as cost-saving efforts in the long term.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 and has a VGM Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Applied Industrial Technologies’ 2022 earnings has moved up by 4.6% to $7.52 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 24.77%.RPM International manufactures and markets high-performance coatings, sealants and specialty chemicals, primarily for maintenance and improvement applications.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RPM International’s 2022 earnings has moved up by 2.4% to $4.60 per share in the past 30 days.

The company is poised to benefit from strong demand for glass packaging, higher selling prices and efforts to improve productivity and efficiency. Cost-control measures will help the company in negating the impact of higher costs and supply-chain issues on its margins in the near term. Its margin-expansion initiative is expected to reap annual benefits of $50 million in the 2022-2024 period. Benefits from its portfolio optimization program and a focus on acquisitions and innovations are likely to fuel growth.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1.

35,863237e1-dbbd-30df-b149-492660c80092,ADM,2022-11-14,FOCUS-New processors to reshape North Dakota's export-focused soy sector,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-processors-reshape-north-dakotas-060000649.html,1668405600,STORY,['ADM'],"[By Karl PlumeSPIRITWOOD, North Dakota, Nov 14 (Reuters) - North Dakota's soybean industry is at the forefront of what could be a once-in-a-generation transformation in coming years, with two new processing plants set to open in 2023 and 2024 to meet rising domestic biofuel production.U.S. soybean crush capacity may swell by as much as 30% over the next four years, with more than a dozen planned new facilities or expansions that are part of a nationwide wave of investment in processing the main U.S. export crop, largely to supply vegetable oil to renewable diesel makers.The surge would upend traditional trade flows as exports of whole soybeans to markets like China give way to more domestic demand and greater overseas shipments of soymeal, a product that China typically does not import.Nowhere will this shift be more stark than in North Dakota, the No. 4 U.S. soy state by planted acres, which ships about 70% of its harvest of the high-protein oilseed to China annually. Instead, the new facilities will be able to process half of the state's soy harvest into oil for biofuel and meal for livestock feed.Although China has imported more U.S. soybeans this year after a smaller-than-expected 2022 South American crop, the world's biggest soy buyer has been relying increasingly on Brazil in recent years for its soybean needs.Meanwhile, U.S. biofuel makers are seeking more plant oils like soyoil to produce renewable diesel as demand for lower carbon fuels surges.But soymeal demand growth has lagged, foreshadowing a glut of the feed ingredient unless markets are expanded.CRUSHING ITWeather-beaten concrete grain silos tower over the tiny town of Spiritwood, located along BNSF Railway's main line that links North Dakota's farms to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.Here, global crop merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland and Marathon Oil are building a $350 million crush plant where a barley malting plant once stood. The Green Bison Soy Processing LLC facility is slated to open in late 2023.Story continuesThe crush plant will draw soybeans from farmers 60 miles in each direction, said Mike Keller, vice president with ADM.It may also prompt growers to plant more of the oilseed instead of crops like wheat and barley, and transform crop marketing plans and grain flows in the state, farmers and analysts said.Monte Peterson, a farmer in Valley City about 25 miles from Spiritwood, expects to store more soybeans on-farm once the plant opens while timing sales selectively instead of shipping them all at harvest time when prices are normally lower.""With crush capacity building here, farmers are going to be storing more soybeans to ship 12 months out of the year,"" said Peterson.All of the soyoil produced in Spiritwood will be shipped to a Marathon plant in Dickinson 200 miles west to produce renewable diesel, a lower-carbon biofuel that can be used interchangeably with petroleum-based diesel.The final destination for soymeal is less certain. ADM said this summer that it is initially targeting livestock and poultry producers around the region, and expects exports to ramp up in coming years. U.S. Department of Agriculture trade missions and industry groups have targeted some buyers, but growing markets will take time.Exporters will look to increase sales to southeast Asia and Europe, and possibly displace shipments from top supplier Argentina in markets such as Australia and New Zealand, said John Baize, president of consultancy John C. Baize &amp; Associates.EXPORT EXPANSIONU.S. grain exports have been reaching global buyers for decades via Gulf Coast and Pacific Northwest terminals.But most existing export facilities there were built to move dry whole grain, not processed products like soymeal, which can clog grain handling equipment.Some Gulf Coast exporters employ smaller mid-river rigs that unload barges directly onto ocean-going ships.One meal-focused terminal at the Port of Grays Harbor in Aberdeen, Washington, owned by farm cooperative AG Processing Inc (AGP) is working to double its export capacity to 6 million tonnes annually by 2025.The U.S. Maritime Administration approved a $25.5 million infrastructure grant last month for export terminal expansion. U.S. soybean farmers and industry groups pledged an additional $1.3 million to help offset design and development costs.""AGP's expansion project at the Port of Grays Harbor is arguably the most immediate opportunity for soybean farmers to assist with the need for increased soybean meal export capacity,"" said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.(Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Editing by Andrea Ricci)]"

For more companies, take a look at Top 5 Hospitality Companies in the World. The hospitality industry has started to make a strong recovery from the pandemic-era losses, even though the Russian invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation dampened the industry sentiment and created new hurdles. A research report from The Business Research Company shares that between 2021 and 2022, the global hospitality market grew from $3.9 trillion to $4.5 trillion at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9%. This rate is attributable to the aforementioned pent up demand, as the research firm believes that the same industry will grow at a much lower CAGR of 7.4% from 2022 to 2026, to be worth $6 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Another research report, this time from Market Data Forecast, has a much more optimistic CAGR for the hospitality industry. This research firm estimates that the sector will grow at a whopping 18.5% between 2022 to 2027, and from an initial value of $3.5 trillion to a whopping $4.1 trillion. Alongside an easing in coronavirus restrictions, Market Data Forecast also believes that once commodity prices drop and international travel picks up, the industry will see growing demand which will lead to revenue and capacity utilization rising. Asia Pacific and North America led the market in 2020, as they accounted for a large 70% chunk of the total revenue pie.Finally, Facts and Factors estimates that the industry was worth $3.9 trillion in 2021 and from then to 2028, it will grow at a CAGR of 10.24% to sit at an estimated $6.7 trillion by the end of the forecast period. However, it diverges from the earlier research reports and notes that Europe was the leading revenue contributor in 2021.Today's piece will take a look at the largest hospitality firms in the world, and the leading players, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), are likely to catch your eye.Story continuesTop 10 Hospitality Companies in the WorldPhoto by Gio Bartlett on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned the hospitality industry to determine which companies are operating in it and providing services.

The shares have remained flat year to date, and they were down significantly in mid July but have see-sawed since then to reverse the losses. This growth is partly attributable to the strong operating performance posted by the firm in its third fiscal quarter, which saw it grow adjusted operating income by $142 million annually and by $89 million over 2019. Additionally, the firm's fee revenue grew by 50% in Q3 2022 over Q3 2019, and its earnings in Americas also exceeded those of 2019, indicating that the firm is now fully on the path to recovering from the pandemic's devastation.Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) has also reduced its debt to asset ratio of late, and the firm increased its rooms growth outlook for 2022 to 6.5% in November 2022.Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H)'s largest investor is Mason Hawkins Southeastern Asset Management which owns 2.8 million shares that are worth $213 million.8.

As of October 2022, its RevPAR stood at 90% of pre-coronavirus levels, since the ongoing hide and seek between the Chinese government and lockdowns is dampening economic growth in the region. The RevPAR recovery was helped by daily room rates increasing and H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) believes that it will have to raise the rates in Europe to deal with rising inflation.Daiwa raised H World Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT)'s share price rating to Buy from Outperform in October 2022, and reduced the share price target to $34 from $43, basing the decision on China reopening in mid 2023.

NRG.Industry: Electric UtilityLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2017142/4-electric-power-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-industryThe Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks continue their transition toward clean sources of fuel and focus on lower carbon emissions. Utilities are benefiting from rate hikes and efficient cost management. The utility stocks are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Co., with a large investment to expand renewable operations, its widespread transmission and distribution assets, and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include PG&amp;E Corporation, Consolidated Edison and NRG Energy, Inc.  Inc.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles.A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward the cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 20% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 and 24% in 2023 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 38 GW and 54 GW to be added in 2022 and 2023, respectively.The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation, and EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and further to 19% in 2023. EIA also expects the share of natural gas in power generation to drop from 38% in 2022 to 36% in 2023. The government is helping to increase the usage of renewable energy through tax credits, and operators are cutting down emissions on their own, intending to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Demand For Electricity Can Decline: Per EIA, 2023 electricity generation in the United States can drop 2% from the 2022 levels due to a decline in demand. EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 will be due to a cooler temperature forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling and slight economic contraction. Despite the expected drop in demand, the addition of new renewable energy assets in the total generation portfolio will continue.Ongoing Increase Rate is a Concern: Utilities to maintain, upgrade and expand operations to approach the capital markets for loans to fund their capital projects.  Utilities regularly distribute dividend from their profits and don’t necessarily have enough retained profits to fund capital projects. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years, but with six hikes have now pushed the benchmark rate to a range of 3.75%-4%, and more rate hikes are likely in the future.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as they will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers, but the necessary raise in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility - Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #71, which places it in the top 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the upward earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are showing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Utility Electric Power industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 and its own sector over the past 12 months.

Investors have to seek it out amidst other industries including solar and chemicals. Sometimes, you may simply stumble across a company innovating in alternative energy just by taking a look at some top Zacks Ranked stocks.That makes it difficult to know what is “alternative energy” and what isn’t.The Lithium ProducersBut some industries are more obvious than others. Lithium is used in electric vehicle batteries. It’s becoming an important part of the EV infrastructure.SQM (SQM) is a Chilean producer who is one of the largest lithium producers in the world. Earnings of SQM are expected to soar 530% this year as lithium prices have tripled.Story continuesSQM is cheap, as earnings soar, with a forward P/E of just 7.6.Albemarle (ALB) is also a lithium producer but it is headquartered in the United States. Albemarle’s earnings are expected to rise 429% in 2022 and another 33% in 2023.Like SQM, Albemarle is also cheap with a forward P/E of 13.4. It also pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.6%.Should lithium be on your radar?Is it Finally Time for Solar?An obvious area for alternative energy is solar. But investors have been waiting many years for solar to finally take off. It only generates 3% of the US energy.2023 could be the year for solar.JinkoSolar (JKS), a Chinese solar company, is up 4.3% year-to-date. JinkoSolar shares are cheap. It is trading with a forward P/E of 13.6.But the analysts are bullish about this year and next. Earnings are expected to jump 115% in 2022 and continue to rise in 2023, gaining another 68.4%.Is the growth story finally there in the solar stocks like JinkoSolar?What About Fossil Fuel Companies?Some fossil fuel companies are looking to the future and turning their focus to alternative energy. Could they be a legitimate alternative energy play?Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), for example, has 2 renewable projects that will provide power to the company’s Permian Basin and Texas electric grid. It participates in the 160 MW Concho Valley Solar project.Pioneer Natural Resources is also working with NextEra Energy (NEE) to develop a 140 MW wind generation facility on Pioneer Natural Resources’ land in Midland, Texas.NextEra Energy is a Florida clean energy company with a market cap of $153 billion. NextEra Energy isn’t cheap with a forward P/E of 26.7. However, Pioneer Natural Resources is. It trades with a forward P/E of just 8.Should alternative energy investors have fossil fuels on their short list?What else should you know about alternative energy stocks?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of SQM and PXD in her personal portfolio.]Find Alternative Energy StocksInvestor Alert: The Predictive Power of the Market-Beating Zacks System Now Focuses on the Hottest Stock Sector of AllOur Alternative Energy Innovators trading service is ready to launch.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% Yield. Despite the market downturn of 2022, dividend payments hit a record, which solidifies the countless studies and researches which claim that dividend stocks outperform the market during difficult times. For example, according to the WSJ, the S&amp;P 500 companies paid out a record $140.6 billion in dividends in the second quarter of this year, as compared to $137.6 billion in the first three months of the year and $123.4 billion in the second quarter last year. The WSJ report also said that annual dividend payouts have posted new highs every year except 2020. The article also quotes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, who believes dividends are slated to set new records.The analyst said at the time that dividend payments in 2022 are projected to grow at a faster pace than usual.While high-yield dividend stocks come with their own risks, several studies prove that high-yield dividend stocks that have a history of dividend increase almost always tend to outperform the broader market. A report by S&amp;P Global says that the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats group consistently posted higher yields when compared to its benchmark between 1999 until 2018. The average yield of this high-yield index was 3.5%, while the S&amp;P Composite 1500 was 1.8%. However, it’s also important to diversify your portfolio for total markets returns. The secret is to never put all your eggs in one basket. The same S&amp;P Global study mentions some interesting data points in this regard. For instance, the study says that the the S&amp;P Composite 1500 generated a total return of 215.2% from 2009 to 2019. About 45% of this return was from dividend income, while 55% came from price appreciation. During the same time period, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats group generated a total return of 590.3%. 57% of this return came from dividend income while price appreciation accounted for about 43% of this return. However, it's important to note that the stocks in this study had several years of dividend increases. When a company has a solid history of dividend increases, it goes to great lengths to keep that streak. Usually, extremely high-yield dividend stocks cannot keep growing their dividends. Whenever you see a stock with an extremely high payout ratio, do not expect that company to become a dividend aristocrat or dividend king. However, that does not mean that these high-yield dividend stocks are uninvestable. Many high-yield dividend investors make a lot of money by investing in ultra high-yield dividend stocks with a short-term perspective.Story continuesInvestors who were skeptical of dividend investing started having second thoughts as we entered the second half of 2022. The stock market crash and broader bloodbath causing billions of losses in the equities market forced investors to run towards dividend stocks that are stable and can promise reliable income during these difficult times. Dividend value stocks soared in popularity this year and analysts believe retail and institutional investors will continue to pour money into these stocks because the Federal Reserve is still unable to control inflation and the US economy is entering the stage of broader layoffs. Dividend stocks are known to weather the market downturns. According to a detailed study by Heartland Advisors, dividend stocks easily outperform non-dividend stocks in moderate downturns. Even during major and severe downturns, each quintile of dividend payers in the study substantially outperformed non-dividend payers. The same report also quoted a research report by the Wall Street Journal, which said that during the market downturns of 1981-1982, 1990, 2000-2002, and 2008, dividend-paying companies as a whole outperformed non-dividend companies.It’s a no-brainer that high-yield dividend investing isn’t always the best way forward, especially for those who want to avoid risks. The Heartland study quotes a report from Credit Suisse, which says that when evaluating dividend yields, companies with low payout ratios have higher returns. That’s because earnings sustain dividend payments, and if a company’s payout ratio is irrationally high, it cannot sustain its high yields and would eventually cut or suspend its dividends. The Heartland study calls this a “yield trap.” Another important mistake in high-yield dividend investing is to have a total disregard for sectors and blindly following yields. A good example would be an investor pouring all his money into the financial services sector in 2007-2008 unbeknownst to the fact that those stocks were headed for a disaster.The Heartland report also makes an important point that is relevant to today’s dynamics. The report says that when it comes to large institutional investors, it’s difficult to quickly redistribute resources and allocate sizable chunks of portfolios to dividend stocks when a market downturn starts. That’s because the decision making process in large institutions is slow. That’s why, according to the report, it’s always recommended to diversify your portfolio and invest in dividend stocks in all circumstances for risk aversion. This year, we saw that major growth hedge funds which have a strict portfolio allocation strategy with a bias towards growth investing (Cathie Wood comes to mind) suffered huge losses, while Warren Buffett and the likes who have been holding major value stocks that have been paying solid dividends were able to avoid heavy losses.In this article we picked dividend stocks with over 8% dividend yields. All these yields were recorded as of October 29. It's important to note that many of these stocks do not have the most attractive fundamentals or outlook. The purpose of this article is to give you a list of stocks that are offering high-dividend yields in the current market environment. Because of high payout ratios or other business dynamics, it's possible that these stocks might not be able to sustain their high dividend yields.Source: PixaBay9 Dividend Stocks with Over 7% Yield9.

Sales volume increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by improved operational performance. Average Sales Price - Average sales price increased in fiscal 2022 as input costs such as live cattle, labor, freight and transportation costs increased and demand for our beef products remained strong in the first half of the fiscal year. Average sales price decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by reduced demand for premium cuts of beef as compared to exceptionally high demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating Income - Operating income decreased as margins compressed from historically high levels, paired with continued increased operating costs as a result of the inflationary market environment. Operating income benefited from a $71 million gain due to a settlement in fiscal 2022, compared to a $55 million gain from the recovery of cattle inventory in fiscal 2021, related to a cattle supplier's misappropriation of Company funds. Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2022 benefited from $27 million of insurance proceeds related to a fire at a production facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, partially offset by $16 million in restructuring and related charges.PorkSales Volume - Sales volume decreased due to reduced domestic availability of live hogs. Average Sales Price - Average sales price increased in fiscal 2022 as input costs such as live hogs, labor, freight and transportation costs increased, partially offset by unfavorable mix associated with labor shortages. Average sales price decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 due to unfavorable product mix associated with export demand and elevated domestic availability of finished products. Operating Income - Operating income decreased due to periods of compressed pork margins and increased operating costs as a result of the inflationary market environment. Additionally, volatile market conditions resulted in net derivative gains of $10 million in fiscal 2022 and net derivative losses of $90 million in fiscal 2021, which excludes the impacts of related physical purchase transactions.ChickenSales Volume - Sales volume increased primarily due to improved domestic production partially offset by inventory growth and strategic initiative mix impacts. Average Sales Price - Average sales price increased primarily due to the effects of pricing initiatives in an inflationary cost environment. Operating Income - Operating income increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher average sales prices and increased sales volume, partially offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions including increased supply chain and labor costs. Operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was impacted by $165 million of higher feed ingredient costs, offset by $65 million of net derivative gains as compared to $75 million of net derivative losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating income in fiscal 2022 was impacted by $595 million of higher feed ingredient costs, offset by $195 million of net derivative gains as compared to $65 million of net derivative gains in fiscal 2021. Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2022 benefited from $35 million of insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred related to a fire at a production facility. Operating income in fiscal 2021 was impacted by $626 million of losses from the recognition of legal contingency accruals and $23 million of expenses related to a fire at a production facility.Prepared FoodsSales Volume - Sales volume decreased in fiscal 2022 due to the impacts of uneven foodservice recovery, the divestiture of our pet treats business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, increased pricing and a challenging supply environment impacting the first half of fiscal 2022. Sales volume was relatively flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Average Sales Price - Average sales price increased due to the effects of revenue management in an inflationary cost environment. Operating Income - Operating income decreased in fiscal 2022 due to the recognition of a $784 million gain on the sale of our pet treats business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Higher average sales prices were offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions, including $55 million and $615 million of increased raw materials and other input costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2022, respectively, in addition to increased supply chain and labor costs. Additionally, operating income in fiscal 2022 was impacted by $36 million of restructuring and related charges.OUTLOOKFor fiscal 2023, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicates domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) should decrease approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2022 levels. The following is a summary of the outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook for revenues, capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity, tax rate and dividends for fiscal 2023.3Beginning in fiscal 2022, we launched a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making. We were targeting $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024, including more than $400 million in fiscal 2022, relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. We realized more than $700 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, which partially offset the impacts of inflationary market conditions, and we now believe we will exceed our $1 billion target in fiscal 2023.BeefUSDA projects domestic production will decrease approximately 6% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin at or below the low end of our long-term range of 5% to 7% in fiscal 2023 as margins are expected to decrease from historically high levels.PorkUSDA projects domestic production will be relatively flat in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate adjusted operating margin of 2% to 4% in fiscal 2023.ChickenUSDA projects chicken production will increase approximately 2% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of 6% to 8% for fiscal 2023.Prepared FoodsWe anticipate an adjusted operating margin of 8% to 10% in fiscal 2023 driven by volume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management.International/OtherWe anticipate improved results from our foreign operations in fiscal 2023.RevenueWe expect sales to be $55 billion to $57 billion in fiscal 2023.Capital ExpendituresWe expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures include spending for capacity expansion and utilization, automation to alleviate labor challenges and brand and product innovation.Net Interest ExpenseWe expect net interest expense to approximate $320 million for fiscal 2023.LiquidityWe expect total liquidity, which was approximately $3.3 billion at October 1, 2022, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.0 billion.Tax RateWe currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 23% in fiscal 2023.DividendsEffective November 11, 2022, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend previously declared on August 11, 2022, to $0.48 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.432 per share on our Class B common stock. The increased quarterly dividend is payable on December 15, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2022. The Board also declared on November 11, 2022 a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share on our Class A common stock and $0.432 per share on our Class B common stock, payable on March 15, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2023. We anticipate the remaining quarterly dividends in fiscal 2023 will be $0.48 and $0.432 per share of our Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. This results in an annual dividend rate in fiscal 2023 of $1.92 for Class A shares and $1.728 for Class B shares, or a 4% increase compared to the fiscal 2022 annual dividend rate.3 The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2023 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2023 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of the amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for these forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating margin should not be considered a substitute for operating margin or any other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.TYSON FOODS, INC.CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS

included $545 million recognized as a reduction to sales and $81 million recognized as an increase of Cost of Sales.7 Relates to fires at production facilities in Chicken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and Beef in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Amount includes insurance proceeds, net of costs incurred, of $62 million recognized in Cost of Sales and $52 million net proceeds recognized in Other, net for fiscal 2022 and $23 million net expense recognized in Cost of Sales and $6 million net proceeds recognized in Other, net for fiscal 2021.EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Net debt to EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis.We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA).

As a leader in patient financing, we believe it is important to build awareness among consumers of the cost of healthcare over a lifetime.""Additionally, the Synchrony Lifetime of Healthcare Costs study suggests many people significantly underestimate their annual healthcare expenditures and do not save for future healthcare costs, leading many to delay recommended medical procedures, often to the detriment of their health. For example, while respondents estimated their annual out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures as approximately $850 (not including paid premiums) on average, the actual spending [1] averages around $2,100 annually — 145%, or nearly one-and-a-half times, more than the anticipated cost. ""Today's consumers set aside money for college or a mortgage, but not for healthcare. As a leader in patient financing, we believe it is important to build awareness among consumers of the cost of healthcare over a lifetime, so they think about and prepare for how to save and pay for their current and future healthcare needs,"" said Alberto Casellas, chief executive officer, Health and Wellness, Synchrony. ""The study shows there is a meaningful gap between people's perceptions and the reality of the costs of healthcare. As consumers assume more and more responsibility for their healthcare expenses, it is important to understand the cost of care and how to find responsible financial solutions that can help them save for and manage those costs.""Story continuesFeeling the financial pressureThe $320,000 average, based on a subset of the nearly 3,200 survey respondents included in the study [2], breaks down as follows: respondents incurred on average $5,266 of annual individual healthcare costs (including insurance premiums, out-of-pocket expenses and co-insurance over deductibles). Extrapolated during an adult lifetime, this could mean an estimated $320,000 in individual healthcare costs between the ages of 18 and 79.The impact of these real-world costs is substantial: more than one in four respondents said they have delayed a recommended procedure due to cost — and an almost 20% of respondents ignored the recommended care completely. For those who delayed or ignored the recommended care, nearly 50% said it caused additional medical issues.The big question: are we saving enough?According to the study, four out of five said they do not have a dedicated savings account for unexpected health costs. Among those who do, almost half say it is not enough. Fewer than half are actively saving for future healthcare expenses; and of those who are, only 55% believe it will be enough to meet their expenses.The generational divideWhile affordability of healthcare is a crucial concern among all respondents, the study illustrates stark differences when data is broken out by age:Half of Gen Z, Millennials and Gen X, on average, would hold off non-urgent medical treatment if the cost of care was between $500 and $999 as compared to approximately one-third of Boomers.Approximately 25% of Gen Z, Millennials and Gen X would hold off non-urgent medical treatment if the cost of care was less than $500 as compared to 16% of Boomers and 10% of the Silent Generation.65% of Millennials and 60% of Gen Xers were not financially prepared for their most costly out-of-pocket healthcare expense. This number falls to more than 40% for Boomers and 23% for members of the Silent Generation.Healthcare planning resourcesSynchrony, a Fortune 200 company with a 90-year heritage in consumer lending and more than 35 years of experience in healthcare finance through its CareCredit credit card, is offering educational resources to help patients learn more about healthcare costs and the financial solutions that can help patients plan and pay for care.

We believe firmly that there is importance and significance in representation.”ABC 57 reported that the company has been a part of Project Impact, an initiative in South Bend providing resources to support minority-owned businesses. Luten said he depends on such support to help the company reach its goals, which include scaling up to a new 4,200-square-foot facility.“We want to be able to open and expand more opportunity to our communities and to engage minority entrepreneurs and expand the opportunity,” said James Summers a volunteer executive director of Project Impact.“Our entire goal behind Importin’ Joe’s is to change the trajectory of children who are at risk and children who are homeless so our goal is to cultivate a community that can eventually accommodate 15,000 or more from children and women in Ethiopia, while simultaneously equipping our current ecosystem in our community here as well,” said Luten.Future plans for the company include supporting the local community, giving back to their roots, and working to expand to more than 60 locations across Indiana and Southwest Michigan by the spring.]"

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Sept. 21 that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the war.Both Ukraine and Russia say the other side has sustained devastatingly high casualties. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield claims from either side.The United States' top general estimated on Nov. 9 that Russia and Ukraine had each seen more than 100,000 of their soldiers killed or wounded. ""A lot of human suffering,"" Army General Mark Milley told the Economic Club of New York.Milley said the conflict so far had turned anywhere from 15 million to 30 million Ukrainians into refugees, and killed probably 40,000 Ukrainian civilians.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces.About 14,000 people were killed there between 2014 and the end of 2021, according to OHCHR, including 3,106 civilians.*MISERYSince Feb. 24, one third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes, the largest current human displacement crisis in the world, the United Nations refugee agency has said. Ukraine has a population of more than 41 million.Story continuesThere are currently more than 7.8 million refugees from Ukraine recorded across Europe, with the biggest numbers in Poland, Russia and Germany, according to the agency's data.* UKRAINEBesides the human losses, Ukraine has lost control of around 22% of its land to Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, according to Reuters calculations.It has lost a swathe of coastline, its economy has been crippled and some cities have been turned into wastelands by Russian shelling. Ukraine's economy will contract by 45% in 2022, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have estimated.The true dollar cost to Ukraine is unclear. It is unclear how much Ukraine has spent on fighting.* RUSSIAThe war has been expensive for Russia too - though it does not disclose the costs which are state secrets.Besides the military costs, the West has tried to punish Moscow by imposing severe sanctions - the biggest shock to Russia's economy since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.Russia's central bank last month improved its GDP forecast for this year to a contraction of 3-3.5% from an expected 4-6% decline previously. In late April, it had expected GDP to shrink 8-10%.The economy ministry sees a contraction of 2.9% this year and a 0.8% fall in 2023.Still the impact on Russia's economy is severe - and not yet fully clear. It has been excluded from Western financial markets, most of its oligarchs are sanctioned, and it is experiencing problems sourcing some items such as microchips.Russia has defaulted on its foreign bonds for the first time since the calamitous months following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.The central bank has cautioned that the partial mobilisation could stoke longer-term inflation. The central bank tweaked its year-end inflation forecast to 12-13% from 11-13%.* PRICESThe invasion and Western sanctions on Russia led to steep rises in the prices of fertiliser, wheat, metals and energy, feeding into both a brewing food crisis and an inflationary wave that is crashing through the global economy.Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's biggest exporter of natural gas, wheat, nitrogen fertiliser and palladium. Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, international oil prices spiked to their highest levels since the records of 2008.Attempts to reduce reliance on Russian oil, gas and oil products - or even to cap their prices - have exacerbated what is already the most severe energy crunch since the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s.The war has cut global growth while an energy crisis in Europe could tip Europe into a deeper crisis, according to Goldman Sachs which expects global GDP growth to slow to 1.8% in 2023.* WESTERN WEAPONSThe United States has provided more than $18.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Feb. 24 including stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin anti-armour systems, 155mm Howitzers and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment.In total, about 52 billion euros in military, financial and humanitarian aid had been pledged by Oct. 3 to Ukraine by countries around the world, according to The Kiel Institute for the World Economy.Russia says that the West's supplies of advanced weapons to Ukraine are finding their way onto the black market and then into the hands of extremist and criminal groups in the Middle East, central Africa and Asia.(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge, Editing by Gareth Jones and Andrew Heavens)]"

What started off as minor inflation has now reached 40-year highs. The Fed's reaction to the alarmingly high inflation rate sent reverberations to the equities market and caused rampant sell-offs, with all major market indices declining. Russia's invasion of Ukraine played a role in driving the downtrend in emerging markets, and a further catalyst was the dollar, which has remained strong throughout 2022.The Worst Might Be Over, Markets Rally On Weak CPI ReportOn November 10, The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI report for October which showed signs of the economy cooling. The all-items index rose 7.7% year over year, the smallest twelve-month increase since the period ending January 2022. The all items less food and energy index recorded an increase of 6.3% year over year, the energy index rose 17.6% over the twelve months ending October, and the food index increased 10.9% over the past twelve months. All of these components declined from the numbers that came out in September. Some experts are saying inflation may have peaked and the markets rallied on a weak CPI print for October, with the S&amp;P 500 going back up to 3,900, the Dow surging to 33,400, and the Nasdaq rising to 10,900.""We Are Starting To See Some Benefits That The Fed Is Looking For""Shortly after the CPI report for October was released, Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his take on the inflation data and what to expect from the Fed moving forward. Zervos noted that the weak CPI report ""is a lot of relief"" and that now we are in a ""fine-tuning phase"" since ""we have done the heavy lifting, we have had 400 basis points done already"". For year-end, Zervos sees the Fed raising rates by another 50 basis points or potentially 75 basis points and said that ""we have a lot of QT (quantitative tightening) to get through"". Zervos noted that ""there's a lot of tightening in the hopper"" and that ""we are starting to see some benefits that the Fed is looking for"" and this is good for the markets.Story continuesTech companies have been hammered hard in 2022, and their valuations have suffered due to the higher borrowing costs.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards.

72,38683faf-04ce-3bd7-aa2b-9383e1602abe,JNJ,2022-11-14,Is Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-high-dividend-yield-etf-112011836.html,1668424811,STORY,['JNJ'],"[The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) was launched on 11/10/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Vanguard, and has been able to amass over $49.63 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, VYM seeks to match the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index.The FTSE High Dividend Yield Index which is consists of common stocks of companies that pay dividends that generally are higher than average.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Annual operating expenses for VYM are 0.06%, which makes it one of the least expensive products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.92%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 20.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector; Healthcare and Consumer Staples round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) accounts for about 3.28% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Jpmorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM).The top 10 holdings account for about 23.11% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF has lost about -0.07% so far, and was up about 2.85% over the last 12 months (as of 11/14/2022). VYM has traded between $94.88 and $115.01 in this past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 23.40% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 24.8 months for the LYNPARZA plus abiraterone arm versus 16.6 months for the placebo plus abiraterone arm, with or without homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations.The safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials and the known profiles of the individual medicines. The most common adverse events (AEs) (≥20%) were anemia (46%), fatigue (37%) and nausea (28%). Grade ≥3 AEs were anemia (15%), hypertension (4%), urinary tract infection (2%), fatigue (2%), decreased appetite (1%), vomiting (1%), back pain (1%), diarrhea (1%) and nausea (0.3%). Approximately 14% of patients who received LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone discontinued treatment due to an AE.Story continuesProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Europe, with an estimated 473,000 cases and 108,000 deaths in 2020. Approximately 10-20% of patients with advanced prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, and at least 84% of these men will develop metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Patients with advanced prostate cancer have a particularly poor prognosis, and the five-year survival rate remains low.Noel Clarke, urological surgeon and professor of urological oncology at the Christie/Salford Royal Hospitals and University of Manchester and the PROpel trial joint senior investigator, said, ""Patients with mCRPC in the European Union have limited treatment options. This form of advanced prostate cancer has a poor prognosis, and treatment decisions after initial diagnosis are critical. If approved in the European Union for prostate cancer of this type, olaparib in combination with abiraterone will provide a much-needed new treatment option for the many men with this condition.""Susan Galbraith, executive vice president, oncology R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said, ""With the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer set to double in the coming decades, it is more important than ever that we bring new treatment options to suitable patients at the earliest possible moment in their care. If approved, LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone will represent the first combination of a PARP inhibitor and a new hormonal agent available to patients in the European Union.""Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""While prostate cancer has seen many advances in care in recent decades, for those with mCRPC, new treatment options are urgently needed. We are fully committed to bringing LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone to suitable patients in Europe as quickly as possible.""LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone is undergoing priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC based on results from the Phase 3 PROpel trial, with a decision expected in Q4 2022.LYNPARZA monotherapy is approved in the U.S. based on results from the Phase 3 PROfound trial for patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC (BRCA-mutated and other HRR gene mutations) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone; and in the European Union, Japan and China for patients with BRCA-mutated mCRPC who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent (NHA).About PROpelPROpel (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03732820) is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or NHAs in the mCRPC setting. The primary endpoint is rPFS, and secondary endpoints include overall survival, time to secondary progression or death and time to first subsequent therapy.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.Venous Thromboembolic Events: Including pulmonary embolism, occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab compared to a ≥5% frequency for placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%) and leukopenia (18%).

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad and advanced clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with advanced prostate cancer will develop CRPC within five years, and at least 84% of these patients will have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting.

If you want to see more of the top investment companies in the world, go directly to Top 5 Investment Companies in the World.Although it might not sound very important, distributing capital efficiently is very important to an economy. With the smart and efficient distribution of capital to the investment projects, a country's economy could potentially grow faster. With more capital going to the companies and projects that make the most productive use of the capital, private enterprise grows faster. With private enterprises larger, more potential jobs can be created and more products and services can be produced. With more products and services produced, living standards in a country can be higher.Although many companies play a role in the investment industry, none arguably play a bigger role than investment banks. Investment banks serve as intermediaries that connect corporations and governments to the capital markets which help decide the distribution of capital through market prices.With access to the capital markets, companies can access capital they need to grow and governments can obtain the financing they need for infrastructure projects if they also have approval of the markets.In the same way that leading investment banks play a big role in a country's economy, banks that lend to small and medium sized businesses can also help growth and create jobs in communities across the world.2022With high inflation in 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially this year. With the higher interest rates, aggregate demand for investment has decreased and many investment banks have not done as well as they could have.Nevertheless, there is a strong probability that the Federal Reserve will win its fight against inflation. The only question is when the Federal Reserve will win and whether the Federal Reserve will trigger a recession or a soft landing in its efforts.Story continuesIf the Federal Reserve wins its fight against inflation, interest rates will eventually normalize and demand for investment could rebound. If demand for investment rebounds, business for investment banks and banks that lend to small and medium sized businesses could increase.In terms of the current data, there has been some more positive data released in terms of recent inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index for October rose only 7.7% from a year ago and 0.4% for the month. That's less than the expected rise of 7.9% year over year and 0.6% for the month. When excluding food and energy costs, core CPI rose 6.3% year over year and 0.3% for the month, versus the expected increase of 6.5% year over year and 0.5% for the month.While the recent data on inflation has been more positive, there is still the chance that inflation could increase again and there is still the probability that economic data might not meet expectations. If that happens, stocks could decline further. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also commented on the recent inflation data, “One month of data does not a victory make, and I think it’s really important to be thoughtful that this is just one piece of positive information, but we’re looking at a whole set of information.”Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of Top 20 Investment Companies in the World, we took the top 20 banks by assets in the world that had either had investment banks or were banks that helped small and medium sized businesses access capital as well.We used assets as a way to rank banks because the loans or business that the banks facilitate often correlate with their assets.Top 20 Investment Companies in the World20.

Moderna, however, said levels of neutralizing antibody response dropped nearly 5-fold against the emerging subvariant BQ.1.1 when compared with BA.4/5, in an analysis of about 40 participants, although the virus neutralizing activity still remained ""robust"".Rival Pfizer Inc and its German partner, BioNTech SE , said earlier this month their Omicron-tailored shot targeting the BA.4/5 subvariants produced a strong antibody response in older adults than the original shot after one month.Based on data from preclinical studies, Omicron-tailored shots made by Moderna and Pfizer have already been approved in the United States for adults as well as for children as young as five years.

If you want to see more of the biggest ESG companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest ESG Companies in the World.As the rapid growth of electric vehicles shows, consumers are increasingly interested in environmental sustainability. Although it might cost a little bit more, it is worth it to many consumers if it helps save the environment and fight against climate change.Over the years, investors have also become more interested in sustainability rather than putting just profits first. For ESG investors, it's worth not making as much in profits if it helps make the world more sustainable.Although ESG actually originated in the 1960's as socially responsible investing, ESG investing has grown substantially more in recent decades. One reason is that global warming has become a much bigger problem now than it was in the 1960's. Another reason is that ESG activists can make a much bigger difference given the internet in their calls for more income equality or better corporate governance. With the internet, a lot more people also realize that our world isn't sustainable in its current path unless we help improve it.ESGESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. In ESG investing, investors assess how well a company does in terms of environmental issues such as reducing their carbon emissions, social issues such how companies help their communities, and governance issues such as management diversity.In ESG investing, an investor might choose to invest in a company that does well in ESG issues but has a slightly higher valuation than a company with similar qualities but doesn't do as well in ESG.Given changing consumer behavior, ESG investing can also add value too. McKinsey explains,Although there can be wide discrepancies in practice, including customers who refuse to pay even 1 percent more, we’ve found that upward of 70 percent of consumers surveyed on purchases in multiple industries, including the automotive, building, electronics, and packaging categories, said they would pay an additional 5 percent for a green product if it met the same performance standards as a nongreen alternative. In another study, nearly half (44 percent) of the companies we surveyed identified business and growth opportunities as the impetus for starting their sustainability programs. The payoffs are real. When Unilever developed Sunlight, a brand of dishwashing liquid that used much less water than its other brands, sales of Sunlight and Unilever’s other water-saving products proceeded to outpace category growth by more than 20 percent in a number of water-scarce markets.

The Fed's reaction to the alarmingly high inflation rate sent reverberations to the equities market and caused rampant sell-offs, with all major market indices declining. Russia's invasion of Ukraine played a role in driving the downtrend in emerging markets, and a further catalyst was the dollar, which has remained strong throughout 2022.The Worst Might Be Over, Markets Rally On Weak CPI ReportOn November 10, The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI report for October which showed signs of the economy cooling.

The all items less food and energy index recorded an increase of 6.3% year over year, the energy index rose 17.6% over the twelve months ending October, and the food index increased 10.9% over the past twelve months. All of these components declined from the numbers that came out in September. Some experts are saying inflation may have peaked and the markets rallied on a weak CPI print for October, with the S&amp;P 500 going back up to 3,900, the Dow surging to 33,400, and the Nasdaq rising to 10,900.""We Are Starting To See Some Benefits That The Fed Is Looking For""Shortly after the CPI report for October was released, Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his take on the inflation data and what to expect from the Fed moving forward. Zervos noted that the weak CPI report ""is a lot of relief"" and that now we are in a ""fine-tuning phase"" since ""we have done the heavy lifting, we have had 400 basis points done already"". For year-end, Zervos sees the Fed raising rates by another 50 basis points or potentially 75 basis points and said that ""we have a lot of QT (quantitative tightening) to get through"". Zervos noted that ""there's a lot of tightening in the hopper"" and that ""we are starting to see some benefits that the Fed is looking for"" and this is good for the markets.Story continuesTech companies have been hammered hard in 2022, and their valuations have suffered due to the higher borrowing costs.

For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business.

Initially, it was the smartphone that was heralded to compress the 'world' in a user's pocket, but as time has passed, more gadgets have enabled greater computing performance in a small form factor for a variety of purposes.Officially dubbed as the Internet of Things (IoT), these gadgets have a wide variety of uses, that range from retailers being able to manage their inventory to the everyday user being able to track their fitness through smartwatches.The proliferation of these devices has been aided by the growth in the Internet as well since all the gadgets require connectivity to function. Taking a look at the market size, Fortune Business Insights estimates that the industry will be worth $479 billion by the end of this year, and from then to 2029, it will grow at an astounding compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.4% and be worth a whopping $2.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period.

86,f62f2afa-9d1f-3f2c-95ef-705b94f9c568,IBM,2022-11-14,7 No-Brainer Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-no-brainer-dividend-stocks-175949716.html,1668103189,STORY,"['ABBV', 'CVX', 'MSFT', 'IBM', 'AFL', 'WMT', 'KO']","[With the monetary paradigm shifting beneath our feet, investors have every reason to consider no-brainer dividend stocks to buy for 2023 and beyond. This is no marketing gimmick – folks need to avoid paralysis by analysis and direct their portfolios based on intuitive dynamics. That’s an overly complicated way of saying don’t fight the current but swim with it.Earlier for InvestorPlace’s Today’s Market segment, I discussed the conundrum that faces the technology sector. Nevertheless, the below sentiment applies perfectly to no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. “In the trailing five years since September 2022, the real M2 money stock expanded over 30%. Put another way, money was “cheap” (or inflationary), so it incentivized business growth. However, in the trailing year, M2 declined over 5%, making money “expensive” (deflationary).”You see, one of the criticisms facing dividend stocks to buy is that the issuing firms redirect money that could be used to expand the business and instead rewards their stakeholders. But guess what? With monetary system tightening, business expansion takes a back seat to stability and earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s why you need to stop thinking too much and consider these no-brainer dividend stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$239.42WMTWalmart$140.74AFLAflac$69.13KOCoca-Cola$59.78CVXChevron$179.47ABBVAbbVie$148.06IBMIBM.$139.18Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comTo succinctly sum up the broader bullish case for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it owns the language of business. When it comes to operating systems for desktops, Microsoft Windows wins hands down with nearly 76% global market share. That’s at the time of writing so it might be different from the time of your reading. Nevertheless, the point stands. For business applications, Microsoft dominates the wider ecosystem.Specifically regarding the case for no-brainer dividend stocks to buy, Microsoft provides a forward yield of 1.21%. No, it’s not something that’s going to make you rich. However, do consider that the company’s payout ratio pings at less than 29%. This reflects that investors can trust the stability and reliability of these admittedly small passive income flows. However, also keep in mind that MSFT shed 33%. In my opinion, it’s a great deal considering the stalwart the company represents.Story continuesMoreover, Gurufocus.com pegs MSFT as a modestly undervalued play based on its proprietary calculations. For me, what stands out is the combination of balance sheet stability (Altman Z-Score of 7.5 or well into the “safe” zone), double-digit revenue growth over the past three years and extremely high quality of business (return on equity of nearly 43%).Walmart (WMT)walmart stockSource: ShutterstockThe big-box retailer that seemingly everyone loves to hate but still shops there anyways, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will become a necessity. I’ll temper this last statement by saying it will likely become a reality based on the aforementioned monetary paradigm shift. As the World Bank pointed out, with international central banks also tightening their currency supplies, a global recession might materialize.In other words, hello everyday low pricing!According to Dividend.com, Walmart offers a forward yield of 1.61%. As with Microsoft above, it’s nothing to write home about. However, the company’s payout ratio pings at 38.3%, which implies a stable and predictable passive income outflow. Just as importantly, WMT offers a slight discount in the market, down almost 4% on a year-to-date basis. Considering the consumer pressure that could be coming our way, WMT may be a steal.Certainly, I think it’s one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. While it’s not the cheapest name out there (trading at 21-times forward earnings), the company enjoys a decently stable balance sheet along with solid margins for the sector. Plus, it’s gaining relevance so capital appreciation from here is not out of the question.Aflac (AFL)Source: ShutterstockOne of the world’s biggest suppliers of supplemental insurance coverage, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) always offered fundamental relevance. Stuff (of the darker, smellier variety) happens in life and Aflac covers financial holes imposed by insurance coverage gaps. Now, the coronavirus pandemic sharply reinforced the idea that stuff can happen at any time. Moreover, it can be utterly devastating, thus cynically bolstering interest toward Aflac.Per Dividend.com, Aflac provides a forward yield of 2.37%. Again, we’re not talking about millionaire-making material here, though it’s an improvement over the other dividend stocks to buy. Currently, Aflac features a payout ratio of just under 30%, reflecting a dependable passive income outflow. Also, keep in mind that the company owns a track record of 39 years of consecutive dividend increases.Another factor to consider for AFL centers on its market performance. Since the start of the year, the security gained nearly 16%. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 shed a very worrying 22% of market value. Part of Aflac’s outperformance stems from the direct correlation between rising rates and rising valuations of insurance stocks.Coca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comIf you had to summarize the U.S. and its distinct take on capitalism, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) would be right up there with this country’s most iconic brands. Indeed, travel pretty much anywhere in the world – for you trolls, I’m not talking about North Korea or other dictatorships – and you’ll see the Coca-Cola imagery plastered throughout major metropolises.At time of writing, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 2.99%. We’re getting into the healthier realm of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy in terms of payout. Now, it does come with a higher rate of risk. Currently, its payout ratio stands at just under 70%. I wouldn’t call it ideal but I also don’t think it’s unstable – just something to watch. Still, on a positive note, Coca-Cola enjoys 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.So yeah, management will likely do whatever it takes to maintain this lofty status.To be fair, KO isn’t cheap, priced at 23-times forward earnings. However, it features a double-digit book growth rate over the last three years. Also, it enjoys very strong margins, bolstering confidence in that yield. Therefore, it’s easily one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAlthough a somewhat controversial figure because of its underlying hydrocarbon business, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) simply represents a necessity at this juncture. Sure, at the end of 2021, we were probably looking forward to building the infrastructure of a clean, renewable future. Well, someone named Vladimir Putin had other ideas regarding global stability. And with Russia blackmailing the west with hydrocarbon outflow cuts, CVX looks cynically attractive.Per Dividend.com, Chevron offers a forward yield of 3.19%. While one of the more generous dividend stocks to buy compared to the major blue chips, it lags the sector average of 4.24%. But here’s the deal with Chevron. First, its payout ratio sits at under 34%. Compared to other energy plays (which features high-yield dividend traps), it’s a solid, dependable ratio. Also, we’re talking about 35 years of consecutive dividend increases.As with some of the other dividend stocks to buy, CVX isn’t cheap. It trades for 11-times forward earnings, ranking it “worse” than over 72% of the industry. However, it features fiscal stability and a very strong return on asset of 13.7%, indicative of a high-quality business.AbbVie (ABBV)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockOne of the pharmaceutical companies that I’ve discussed several times in recent years, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) brings plenty of relevance to the table. However, I’m mostly interested in its Botox unit under its acquisition of Allergan. The benefit here is that as society normalizes, people will inherently prioritize their physical appearance. Cynically, that’s a net positive for ABBV stock.Another checkmark favoring AbbVie centers of course on its inclusion of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of just over 4%. Now, it’s payout ratio pings at 50.5%. From a stability standpoint, it’s not astoundingly great but it’s certainly not something that will keep you up at night. Also, don’t forget that AbbVie features 50 years of consecutive dividend increases.As with the other aristocrats in the space, management will not let that go without a fight.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com rates ABBV as modestly overvalued. However, it trades at 12.6-times forward earnings, which is undervalued for the industry. More broadly, investors will likely focus on its growth and profitability metrics, which are excellent across the board.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVLegacy tech firm IBM (NYSE:IBM) generates some controversy not because of anything it did. Rather, it’s a painfully boring investment. For years, IBM lagged its tech peers as they dove headfirst into cloud computing initiatives. Unfortunately, Big Blue was late to the party. That said, it’s been making up for lost time. As well, it commands leadership in compelling areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.Per Dividend.com, IBM features a forward yield of 4.8%. This ranks very favorably to the tech sector’s average yield of only 1.37%. Investors of dividend stocks to buy should also note that IBM actually gained 1% so far this year. I know, I know – it’s nothing to write home about. However, have you seen the Nasdaq Composite index lately?To be fair, Big Blue also carries a big payout ratio (nearly 69%), which isn’t the most favorable statistic. Still, the bottom line is that the company has 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. No way management will let that stat slip. Finally, IBM offers itself for I would say a more than fair price. Particularly, the stock trades at 14.3-times forward earnings, below the industry median of 22.5 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

88,30f45c3b-4633-3c99-9b15-5e712077f763,GM,2022-11-14,7 Growth Stocks That Are Actually Attractive Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-actually-attractive-174305157.html,1668102185,STORY,"['GE', 'GM', 'FCX', 'IHG', 'SPWR', 'BKNG']","[With macroeconomic trends becoming much more favorable and many growth stocks trading at depressed levels, there are several reasons to believe that growth stocks will soon rally. As a result, longer-term investors should look for growth stocks to buy at this point.Among the favorable macro trends are China’s reopening, impending U.S. government stimulus in the form of the provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the climate law, and a divided government in Washington. Moreover, most economists and prognosticators, from what I’ve heard on television and read online,  appear to believe that the highest Fed interest-rate hikes and inflation jumps are in the rear-view mirror, while the onshoring trend is likely to help many American growth stocks.Here are seven growth stocks to buy that are very well-positioned to benefit from one or more of those positive trends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFCXFreeport-McMoRan$36.50GEGeneral Electric$84.65GMGeneral Motors$40.27EVGOEvgo Inc.$7.16SPWRSunPower$22.31IHGInterContinental Hotels$56.11BKNGBooking Holdings$1,949.26Growth Stocks to Buy: Freeport McMoran (FCX)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has the world’s second-largest copper reserves and more copper reserves than any other U.S.-based company.In recent days, copper prices surged on reports China is looking to reopen its economy by easing its anti-coronavirus measures. In my opinion, those reports are quite credible, so I expect copper prices to continue to climb in the coming days, weeks, and months, sparking similar gains by FCX stock.Moreover, copper, as an essential component of electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines, should get a big lift over the longer term from the world’s efforts to combat climate change.  Meanwhile, the supply of copper is expected to be inadequate to meet the world’s needs over the longer term, S&amp;P Global has reported. Despite all of these strong, positive catalysts, FCX stock has a very low trailing price-earnings ratio of just 13.3.Story continuesGrowth Stocks to Buy: General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn recent days, General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) stock has been climbing as the Street appears to be finally realizing that GE is getting a big lift from pent-up demand for travel and further stability of the healthcare market.Helping, the revenue of the company’s Aerospace unit climbed an impressive 25% year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, to $6.7 billion, as its sales to airlines soared 47% year over year. Moreover, the unit’s margins, excluding acquisitions, jumped 2.8 percentage points year over year to 19%.In addition, investors appear to be pleased with the new, long-term plan unveiled by Boeing (NYSE:BA), one of GE Aerospace’s largest customers. Meanwhile, the outlook of GE’s Power unit has also become bright, as the unit’s orders soared 20% year over year, excluding acquisitions last quarter, and the business should benefit a great deal from the increased use of electricity as the electrification of transportation continues.Growth Stocks to Buy: General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGM (NYSE:GM) recently delivered very strong Q3 results and is becoming a leader in the EV sector. In addition, the automaker last quarter had the highest sales of “SUVs and full-size pickups” in the U.S., and provided full-year EPS guidance, excluding some items, of $6.50-$7.50. At the midpoint of the latter range, GM’s EPS would come in at $7, versus analysts’ previous average estimate of $6.79.Meanwhile, in 2021, the automaker and its joint ventures delivered about 2.9 million vehicles in China. As a result, GM should be a prime beneficiary of the Asian nation’s reopening. On Oct. 26, JPMorgan increased its price target on GM stock to $59 from $58, citing the company’s favorable Q3 results and its “strong execution” despite macro pressures, The Fly reported. The bank kept an “overweight” rating on GM stock.EVgo (EVGO)EV stocks: Electric vehicle logo painted on a blue streetSource: ShutterstockEVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) is a true growth stock, with the EV charging company growing at breakneck speed. In the third quarter, its revenue soared 70% year-over-year to $10.5 million, and it gained about 54,000 new customers, bringing its user base to nearly 500,000. Perhaps more importantly, its network throughput, or the amount of electricity that flowed through its chargers, jumped 51% YOY to 12.1 gigawatt-hours. The latter metric shows that the utilization of its chargers is also growing quickly.According to the company, almost 140 million Americans live within ten miles of one of its fast chargers, showing that its footprint is significant enough to attract millions of more users now. As it deploys more chargers at its partners’ locations, they should become even more accessible to EV owners. (Among the company’s impressive partners are Kroger (NYSE:KR), Safeway, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), all of which have installed EVgo’s chargers at their retail locations). As a result of provisions within the infrastructure law, the company is also likely to receive significant funds from the federal government to build many more chargers.In addition, as I’ve noted in the past, EVgo is partnering closely with GM. Also, as GM’s EV sales increase, EVgo’s top and bottom lines should also climb, boosting EVGO stock in the process.SunPower (SPWR)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockSunPower’s (NASDAQ:SPWR) impressive third-quarter results, reported on Nov. 8, made me a believer in the company. SunPower specializes in selling solar panels to consumers. Its revenue soared 68% year-over-year to $476 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped over 100% YOY to $33 million. And the company’s customer base jumped 63% YOY to 23,100., while it has a total backlog of over 50,000 homes.Further, for all of 2022, the company expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $110 million.Since SunPower has a presence in Europe, it should benefit from the very strong demand for rooftop solar deployments there as the EU implements measures to encourage its citizens to power their homes with solar.Additionally, SunPower, like EVgo, has a partnership with GM that should prove to be very beneficial. Under the deal, “SunPower will be the exclusive solar provider to all GM customers,” said SPWR CEO Peter Faricy on the company’s Q3 earnings call. “We view this as an important new sales channel that capitalizes on the growing interest in rooftop solar that naturally arises from EV ownership,” the CEO added.InterContinental Hotel (IHG)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockFor the last two growth stocks to buy, I’ve chosen names that are benefiting from demand for travel, post-pandemic.One of the firms is the multinational hotel owner InterContinental Hotel (NYSE:ICG).  Among the company’s better-known brands are Regent, Holiday Inn, Candlewood Suites, and Crowne Plaza. Last quarter, it generated impressive earnings per share of $11.74, while its top line soared 52% year-over-year to $1.70 billion. Meanwhile, its operating profit jumped more than 100% year over year to $377 million. That was just only 8% below Q3 of 2019. Finally, its RevPAR, or revenue per available room, jumped 28% versus the same period a year earlier and 2.7% compared with 2019, despite continued, tough coronavirus restrictions in China.As those restrictions ease, IHG’s financial results should improve significantly more going forward. Also noteworthy is that IHG’s CFO, Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson, reported that, “Business travel [in the U.S.] has continued on its trajectory of recovery with revenue in June at a deficit of only 1% to 2019 levels.”Nevertheless, IHG expects its revenue from business travelers to rise further going forward.Booking Holdings (BKNG)two women carrying luggage in an airportSource: Shine Nucha / ShutterstockFormerly known as Priceline, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is an online travel agency that operates many well-known websites, including Priceline, OpenTable, and KAYAK. For the third quarter, the company reported that its top line soared 29% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $5.9 billion. And its earnings per share, excluding some items, soared 41% YOY to $3.03.With the company benefiting from very strong travel trends, its room nights book rose 31% year over year. “We saw an improvement in room night trends as we moved through the [third] quarter,” Booking CEO Glenn Fogel stated, adding that BKNG is “encouraged” by the level of travel reservations for “early 2023.”In a note to investors, trading firm Susquehanna wrote that BKNG reported favorable Q3 results, and the firm kept a “positive” rating on BKNG stock. The firm trimmed its price target on the name to $2,650 from $2,800. The stock closed at $1,859 yesterday.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in FCX, GE, and EVGO.

89,4d150ad9-1d44-3c8d-bf2b-df290b1cf5d4,TGT,2022-11-14,"Walmart, Target, Nvidia, Cisco Systems and Applied Materials are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-target-nvidia-cisco-systems-100010969.html,1668420010,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT', 'CSCO', 'AMAT', 'NVDA', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 14, 2022 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Nvidia NVDA, Cisco Systems CSCO and Applied Materials AMAT.Previewing Retail Sector Earnings as Inventory Issues LingerWalmart shares have recouped a big part of the losses they suffered following the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th. The Walmart sell-off was reinforced by an even more disappointing release from Target the following day.Unlike the market’s indiscriminate negative reaction to Walmart and Target’s quarterly reports in May, it reacted favorably to Walmart’s July-quarter release on August 16th even though Target shares sold off on its quarterly report the following day.This recent history is useful to keep in mind as we look ahead to the October-quarter reports from Walmart and Target on Tuesday (11/15) and Wednesday (11/16), respectively.Part of the explanation for Walmart’s stock market stability is the nature of its business which offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart also benefits from its perceived value proposition to customers that likely prompts segments of consumers to ‘trade down’ to its stores.The big issue in the last two quarterly releases for Walmart and Target centered on rising inventory levels, which reflected the combined effects of shifting consumer behavior and moderating sales. The market seems to believe, based on its treatment of the two stocks, that Walmart is further along in addressing its inventory issue than Target.We have no reason to disprove the market’s optimism about Walmart on the inventory issue, but we can nevertheless see the stock as vulnerable to any signs of weakness in this week’s quarterly report. On the flip side, Target shares appear ‘spring loaded’ for a bounce if the company’s release Wednesday morning turns out to be ‘less bad’ than the market fears.Story continuesWith respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. The Retail sector companies that have reported already are digital vendors like Amazon or restaurant operators like McDonald’s.Unlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-alone Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 52.4% beating revenue estimates.Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the trend particularly notable on the revenues side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).This Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 350 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from a host of traditional retailers, include Nvidia, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials and others.Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all of the results that came out through Friday, November 11th, we now have Q3 results from 461 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 92.2% of the index’s total membership.For the 461 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.The EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.4% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up +1.5%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.Earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be -4.2% below the year-earlier level on +4.9% higher revenues. Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.Estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis.Since mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.1% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -10.9% on an ex-Energy basis. The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.2% since mid-April), Construction (-22.3%), Retail (-18.4%), Industrial Products (-11.9%), Consumer Discretionary (-18.1%) and Aerospace (-12.0%).There are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +3.5% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be, and current revision trends are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Making Sense of the Earnings Picture and Estimate RevisionsWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Intuitive Surgical's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 13% seen over the past five years by Intuitive Surgical.We then compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 19% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

If you want to see more of the biggest ESG companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest ESG Companies in the World.As the rapid growth of electric vehicles shows, consumers are increasingly interested in environmental sustainability. Although it might cost a little bit more, it is worth it to many consumers if it helps save the environment and fight against climate change.Over the years, investors have also become more interested in sustainability rather than putting just profits first. For ESG investors, it's worth not making as much in profits if it helps make the world more sustainable.Although ESG actually originated in the 1960's as socially responsible investing, ESG investing has grown substantially more in recent decades. One reason is that global warming has become a much bigger problem now than it was in the 1960's. Another reason is that ESG activists can make a much bigger difference given the internet in their calls for more income equality or better corporate governance. With the internet, a lot more people also realize that our world isn't sustainable in its current path unless we help improve it.ESGESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. In ESG investing, investors assess how well a company does in terms of environmental issues such as reducing their carbon emissions, social issues such how companies help their communities, and governance issues such as management diversity.In ESG investing, an investor might choose to invest in a company that does well in ESG issues but has a slightly higher valuation than a company with similar qualities but doesn't do as well in ESG.Given changing consumer behavior, ESG investing can also add value too. McKinsey explains,Although there can be wide discrepancies in practice, including customers who refuse to pay even 1 percent more, we’ve found that upward of 70 percent of consumers surveyed on purchases in multiple industries, including the automotive, building, electronics, and packaging categories, said they would pay an additional 5 percent for a green product if it met the same performance standards as a nongreen alternative. In another study, nearly half (44 percent) of the companies we surveyed identified business and growth opportunities as the impetus for starting their sustainability programs. The payoffs are real. When Unilever developed Sunlight, a brand of dishwashing liquid that used much less water than its other brands, sales of Sunlight and Unilever’s other water-saving products proceeded to outpace category growth by more than 20 percent in a number of water-scarce markets. And Finland’s Neste, founded as a traditional petroleum-refining company more than 70 years ago, now generates more than two-thirds of its profits from renewable fuels and sustainability-related products.Story continues2022Although many ESG companies have growth potential, 2022 has been a tough year for the market. To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts think the central bank could continue to raise it further.While October's inflation was lower than expected and the market has rallied recently, there is still uncertainty and potential downside if economic data fails to meet expectations.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.5 Most Diverse Countries in the WorldMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest ESG Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest stocks from Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) in terms of % of the fund and we reranked them based on their market capitalization as of November 12.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Stocks With Over 10 Years of Dividend Increases. Dividend growth is one of the most important factors income investors should pay attention to, especially during financially volatile times like the ones we are living through these days. According to a latest study by Intelligent Capitalworks, companies that have initiated or grown dividends over time also show capital growth and outperform a cohort of stocks that have either sporadic dividend growth policies or those that cut their dividends. The same study also discusses in detail the magical effects of dividend reinvestments especially when it comes to companies that have a history of consistent dividend increases. For example, the study says that if you had invested $100 in Realty Income, a monthly dividend stock which is also a dividend aristocrat, your investment would have been inflated to $2,700 by now. Number of years of consistent dividend growth is an extremely important metric especially for those investors who want to enjoy the benefits of reinvested dividends.The study mentioned above also scrutinized and compared in detail the performance of dividend growers and those companies that cut their dividends from 1980 until 2015. Dividend growers easily outperformed the companies that failed to maintain their dividend growth record in this period. The paper says that the companies that grow their dividends consistently recovered faster than their counterparts in the study. One of the primary reasons behind this, according to the study, was that the dividend acted as a “cushion” and supported the stock prices of these dividend-paying companies. This can be seen from the current market situation as well, as dividend stocks are in huge demand this year because investors are looking for steady income sources amid recession fears. This increased interest from investors is in turn supporting the stock prices of dividend-paying companies.Story continuesMethodologyWe picked stocks that have solid fundamentals and a history of consistent dividend increases.Best Dividend Stocks With Over 10 Years of Dividend Increases10.

APD is a leading global industrial gas supply company and is the largest supplier of hydrogen and helium in the world. It has a sustainable competitive advantage due to long-term customer relationships and contracts, high customer switching costs, and the missioncritical nature of its products. Industrial gases are a relatively small fraction of customers’ overall costs but are crucial to ensure uninterrupted production.Our thesis on APD is that it appears well-positioned for consistent double-digit growth due to a large multi-year capital allocation plan, and the need for accelerating capital expenditures by its customers. It has a $25 billion backlog driven by traditional gas investments along with new growth opportunities like gasification, green hydrogen, and carbon capture. APD’s gasification technologies help improve energy efficiency and independence, which is a key focus for its customers. The company also has a strong management team with a record of expanding margins and exemplary capital allocation.The fund purchased APD in June 2022 at $260. At the time of purchase, APD had a dividend yield of 2.6% and a relative dividend yield of 1.6x the S&amp;P 500, which was near the high end of its historical range.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Movie Production Companies in the World. The motion picture, movie, or film industry is one of the most lucrative sectors in the world as the star studded and glitzy sector is responsible for proving entertainment through a variety of mediums. Growth in technology and innovative delivery channels have also enabled production houses to have a global reach, as movies from one country are shown in picture houses all over the world.This industry is also one of the largest of its kind and it is worth billions of dollars. Big budget films often require countless hours spent over their funding, but if the output is perfect, then they end up bringing back billions in grossing ticket sales. For example, the most successful film of all time, Avatar, has brought in a whopping $2.9 billion since 2009. The second biggest highest grossing movie, Avengers: Endgame, has raked in $2.8 billion in just three years.Overall, the movie production industry is also set to impressively grow over the next decade. A research report from The Business Research Company estimates that the global film and video industry grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4% between 2021 and 2022 to stand at $272 billion. From 2022 to 2026, it will grow at a 6.4% CAGR and sit at $355 billion by the end of the forecast period. Driving this growth will be the Internet and the growth in smartphone usage, as more users come online and access content platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney+ on their gadgets from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. Film production is also helped by drones, and the fastest growing film market in the near term future will be Africa according to the research firm.Another report, this time from Research and Markets, lumps the film and music industries together.

That marked the highest total ever for a film opening in November, topping the $158.1 million for 2013 film ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.""Outside the domestic market, ""Wakanda Forever"" pulled in an estimated $150 million from Wednesday through Sunday. It ranked as the top-grossing Hollywood release in all markets.The results provided a boost to movie theaters, which have struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels of ticket sales. The domestic total ranked as the No. 13 movie debut of all time.""One of the top 15 openings of all time tells me the box office is pretty healthy when there is something audiences what to see,"" said Jeff Bock, senior media analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. ""Marvel time and time again offers something audiences want to see.""The original ""Black Panther,"" starring Chadwick Boseman as King T'Challa, broke ground as the first superhero movie with a predominantly Black cast. The film took in $1.3 billion at worldwide box offices over its run and became the only superhero movie ever nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards.Marvel had to rework ""Wakanda Forever"" after Boseman died of cancer in 2020 just before filming was supposed to begin.The studio decided not to cast another actor in the role of T'Challa. Instead, writer and director Ryan Coogler crafted a new film that centers around T'Challa's younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), his mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and other women who step up to help lead the grieving nation.Story continuesFilm critics praised the sequel, saying Marvel had succeeded in paying tribute to Boseman while offering a compelling film despite the loss of the popular lead character.The movie scored an 84% positive rating from movie critics, and 95% positive from audiences, in reviews collected on the Rotten Tomatoes website.Bock said his local theater was buzzing with a packed crowd for one of the first ""Wakanda Forever"" screenings. ""I hadn't seen that for months,"" he said.Box office year-to-date ticket sales stand at $6.5 billion through Sunday in the domestic market, according to Comscore. That is 33% below the pre-pandemic year of 2019.The problem is a thin slate of films, Bock said. Many Hollywood studios are still dealing with COVID-induced production delays. The number of wide releases in 2022 is 37% lower than in 2017.Theaters are looking ahead to Disney's ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" in December, and a larger number of films in 2023, to increase ticket sales.

These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to measure its performance and may differ from those used by other companies.Management believes that these Non-GAAP measures are helpful as they provide another measure of the results of operations, and are frequently used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the Company.Organic SalesThe Company defines ""organic sales"" as the reported net sales adjusted for: (1) net sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, (2) net sales attributable to disposed businesses or discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods, and (3) the impact of foreign currency changes, which is calculated by translating current period net sales using the comparable prior period's foreign currency exchange rates.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and MarginAdjusted operating income (loss) is computed by excluding the following items from operating income:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the post-acquisition roll-off of fair value adjustments recorded related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.(2) Impairment related charges and other costs. These adjustments include charges related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments. Other costs include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs, and related professional service costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency, consequently restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. Other costs also include legal settlements, executive separation costs, and changes in accounting principle recorded within the period. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, this category includes costs related to the recent internal investigation and associated remediation activities which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional service fees, as well as turnover and other employee-related costs.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.(4) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales.Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Adjusted net income (loss) consists of the reported net income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude the items identified above, the related income tax impacts, and discrete income tax adjustments such as: final settlement of income tax audits, discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation, any difference between the interim and annual effective tax rate, and adjustments relating to prior periods.These adjustments are irregular in timing, and the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted ShareAdjusted earnings (loss) (EPS) per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted earnings (losses) attributable to Dentsply Sirona shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is computed by excluding interest, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as well as the adjustments described above for computing Adjusted Operating Income.DENTSPLY SIRONA INC.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Energy Stock Picks.Ray Dalio is an American billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds. Dalio is also a noted economic commentator and has written extensively on finance and investing. According to Forbes, Mr. Dalio's real-time net worth is $19.1 billion.The ""Three Big Things"" And Where To Invest According To Ray DalioOn October 12, Ray Dalio appeared in an interview on Bloomberg where he discussed the latest economic situation. According to Mr. Dalio, the U.S. economy is facing ""three big things"". The first is ""the amount of debt and money creation"", and according to Mr. Dalio, central banks have not printed money ""to this degree"" except for the period between 1930 and 1945. The second ""big thing"" is ""the amount of internal conflict"", and Mr. Dalio noted that the U.S. has the largest internal wealth gaps since the period between 1930 and 1945. The third challenge the U.S. economy is faced with is ""international conflict"" and the rising competition from China. Ray Dalio also spoke about the Fed's actions in 2022 and his view of the current situation of the U.S. economy. Mr. Dalio noted that increasing the money supply in the economy ""is stimulative over the short run and depressing over the long run"" since quantitative easing is followed by quantitative tightening. Mr. Dalio noted that ""the Fed and the government have given an enormous amount of debt and credit and created a lurch forward, a giant lurch forward, and created a bubble. And now they are putting on the breaks."" According to Mr. Dalio, the Fed is ""trying to navigate"" between sustainably high inflation and a significant weakening of the economy, and this ""will probably be something like the 70s"". Further, Mr. Dalio spoke about where he would park his cash amid the current economic situation. Here are some comments from Mr. Dalio:Story continues""If I was saving, what would I want to save in? I would like to save in the things that I know I am going to need. So I would like to save in my residence, my house. I would like to save, if I could, pay forward my kid's education, pay forward the food or the healthcare that I can, and so on. I would want to save in those things, to buy forward the things I need most fundamentally.""This article will discuss in detail some of Ray Dalio's top energy stock picks which include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Our MethodologyTo determine billionaire Ray Dalio's top 10 energy stock picks, we reviewed Bridgewater Associates' 13F filings that were updated at the close of the third quarter of 2022. We picked the top 10 energy stocks from Ray Dalio's Q3 2022 investment portfolio and arranged them according to Bridgewater Associates' stake in them. Along with each stock, we have included salient features that make them viable investment options and analyst sentiment as well.Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 10 Energy Stock Picks10. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $14,357,000Percentage of Bridgewater Associates' 13F Portfolio: 0.07%Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the United States. As of November 11, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has gained 57.56% year to date and is trading at a PE multiple of 7x. As of September 30, Bridgewater Associates' position in the company is valued at $14.35 million and the investment covers 0.07% of Ray Dalio's 13F portfolio.Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has a strong balance sheet with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.59. The company has a strong cash position and is profitable. According to the company's balance sheet, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has a trailing twelve-month operating margin of 43.49% and has free cash flows of $3.41 billion.On November 1, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) announced earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2022. The company reported an EPS of $2.18 and outperformed estimates by $0.05. The company generated a revenue of $5.43 billion, up 56.72% year over year, and beat Wall Street consensus by $617.85 million.On October 18, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear raised his price target on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) to $96 from $94 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares.Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management had to say about Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”Some of billionaire Ray Dalio's top energy stock picks include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).9.

119,1ac3f717-4e94-378e-bc2b-94ae8a7fe75f,MCD,2022-11-14,McDonald’s adult happy meal mayhem shows America’s selfish need for nostalgia right now,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-adult-happy-meal-mayhem-130000283.html,1668344400,STORY,['MCD'],"[“Nostalgia, it’s delicate but potent,” said Mad Men’s Don Draper as he pitched a concept for Kodak slides. In his famous speech that aired in late 2007, just as Wall Street banks were beginning to wobble under the weight of mortgage-backed securities, the iconic advertising executive described why brands look to the past.Nostalgia, he said, is a Greek word that means ""the pain from an old wound, it's a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone,"" as he scrolled through pictures of his blissful family in the New York suburbs. ""It takes us to a place where we ache to go again,"" he said to a spellbound board room.""This device,"" he added, ""isn't a spaceship. It's a time machine.""In tough economic times, in other words, nostalgia sells. And McDonald's has learned from Don Draper in 2022, taking generations in a time machine all the way back to the ‘90s.When the fast food giant partnered with streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market to sell adult Happy Meals last month, complete with a limited edition toy, the golden arches’ fanbase went wild. Shortly afterward, the fast food chain relaunched its iconic collectible Halloween Pails, which first made an appearance in 1986. The strategy was intended to reel in Gen Z and millennials nostalgic for the McDonaldland of their childhoods, as well as older customers who enjoyed Happy Meals when they were first served 40-plus years ago, a McDonald’s USA spokesperson told Fortune.But while these Happy Meals brought back childhood memories for some, the frenzy wreaked havoc for workers swamped with orders. “New adult Happy Meals are killing me,” a user posted on the McDonald’s employees subreddit.“We ran out of boxes the first day we had them, ran out of toys the second, and on the third day we had to say the truck doesn’t come till tomorrow,” wrote another commenter elsewhere on the subreddit. “It’s been…not fun.”Some disgruntled customers who couldn’t get their hands on a meal took to eBay, where adult Happy Meal toys were going for as much as $300,000 a pop.Story continuesIt’s not the first time one of McDonalds’ throwback product rollouts was met with more excitement than anticipated. The revival of Pokémon Happy Meals in 2021 also created a secondary market where trading cards were being flipped for outsized prices.But the mayhem over all these Happy Meals are never really about the Happy Meal, says Clay Routledge, a psychologist who specializes in nostalgia. “The Happy Meal is an effort to get to something else,” he tells Fortune. “There is something you want in life, and a Happy Meal is a way to kind of grab onto it.”That something is the past, and it says a lot about where our heads are after years of pandemic-related chaos and economic precariousness.The pandemic has elicited a wave of nostalgiaNostalgia provides us with comfort amid fear and uncertainty regarding the future. It’s a natural reaction to the past couple of years because nostalgia is a social emotion centered around memories that make us feel more connected, says Krystine Batcho, professor at Le Moyne College who researches nostalgia. Stress over a looming recession, rising inflation, and residual COVID-19 anxiety has all created a prime opportunity for McDonald’s to unleash a wave of nostalgia-related offers and products that tapped into our desire for levity and a return to simpler times.“Today with all the turmoil, there's so much that we're unsure of,” Batcho tells Fortune. “That is the perfect storm for nostalgia.”People of all ages can be nostalgic, but developmental transitions can be important triggers, such as late adolescence, early adulthood, and retirement age. Batcho notes that trading in childhood for independence creates a tendency to look back at moments of security. Since nostalgia is so tightly wound to trust—something that has markedly decreased during the past couple years—we’re more likely to reminisce on our childhoods, which Batcho says is often the only time in life we fully trusted someone.It’s no wonder, then, that Gen Z, millennials, or even retiring baby boomers went running for adult Happy Meals. “At the broad society level, when a culture is going through a big transition, you see consumer nostalgia really go up,” Routledge says.The disconnect of the Happy MealCompanies have been leaning heavily into nostalgia to sell more products during the pandemic, a calculated move to speak to our exacerbated feelings of warmth toward pre-COVID times.But getting the right marketing campaign can be tricky when it involves tugging on people’s emotions.There’s also a danger of overplaying one’s hand and oversaturating the market: “It's very complex because there's a genius to getting the right mix,” Batcho explains, pointing to Subaru ads and the popularity of the Top Gun sequel as successful examples.Effective nostalgia isn’t about a concrete thing, but the emotion behind it. That was one of the issues with the adult Happy Meal, Batcho says: It targeted a specific kind of audience, rather than the experience itself.Acting on nostalgia can also lead to disappointment when we discover that the reality of it doesn’t recreate our childhood. Such was the case with the adult Happy Meal.“I am a surgical resident and an adult,” tweeted Eric Pillado, “But yes, I did order a Happy Meal because it came in a Halloween bucket. And I’ve never been more content. And yes, I expressed my frustration that they were out of the pumpkin one.”Such frustration destroys “nostalgic value,” Batcho says. A scarcity mindset can make nostalgic purchases tenuous. If the customer perceives the company to be deliberately shortchanging them or not putting enough product out, they might lose their trust in the company. Thus, some customers may have viewed McDonald’s offering as a deliberate attempt to create a competitive market. As Batcho puts it, “Once you get angry, the nostalgia is gone.”In a strange way, this craze was a sign of optimism The backlash to nostalgia is the idea that it’s a type of arrested development, feeding into the narrative that Happy Meal customers are avoiding adulthood. But the nostalgia is more about trying to regain that childlike hope, says Routledge; in that sense, the silliness of this craze is actually a sign of brighter things to come.Routledge adds that nostalgic people are often fueled by good memories, which gives them momentum to move forward. It’s restorative, he says, adding that studies show that nostalgia makes people more optimistic, hopeful, and confident they can accomplish their goals.Adult Happy Meal lovers also enjoy the merits of intergenerational bonding. “It just makes the adult feel the good feelings they had as a kid,” Batcho says. “But now they can pass that on and take their child or their grandchildren for a Happy Meal.”Granted, the endless access to nostalgia the internet provides can sometimes make it less authentic. Routledge says that while nostalgia is adaptive, technological-driven nostalgia can be less so. “A Happy Meal craze or something like that isn't really going deep enough into what makes the nostalgia meaningful; it has more of a superficial element to it,” he says, adding that it’s like a fast solution to nostalgia. Even though it may be tied to a personal memory, “it’s not a very nutritious source of nostalgia.”But this surface-level nostalgia of buying the same plastic toy can help bridge the cultural connection gap humans crave so much, he explains.Beyond connecting, it’s nice to be goofy. “It's good that it shows that we remember that we can deal with the silly and the superficial and the just plain fun,” Batcho says. “That's why childhood was so precious in the first place.”Who knew a waxy Grimace figurine could be a sign of our hope for the future. Or as Don Draper would say, a place where we know we’re loved.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The U.S. housing market to see second biggest correction of the post-WWII era—when to expect the home price bottomSam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherCOVID cases are on the rise again this autumn.

Almost 9 in 10 respondents (89%) will travel the same amount or more compared to last year, with this figure highest in the U.S. (93%) and lowest in the U.K. (86%).Inflationary pressures across the globe continue to impact consumer spending behavior, with almost two-thirds of survey respondents (62%) changing travel plans as a result of rising living costs, consistent with behavior from prior Seasonal Travel Indexes over the last two quarters of 2022. Around a third (32%) will likely travel less or for shorter lengths than previously planned, while a similar number (30%) plan to vacation closer to home than previously planned. Rising energy costs also impact travel behaviors, though slightly less so than rising living costs.While affordability is now nearly twice as important as other factors when planning a trip, travelers will maintain travel spend this season, with over a third (36%) planning to spend about the same amount as last year on travel and over half (52%) spending more.The majority of global travelers (57%) plan to travel domestically this upcoming season, however, the propensity to take international trips has increased (from 40% to 43%) since the previous Seasonal Travel Index. With winter on the horizon in the northern hemisphere, the most popular global destinations feature a mix of major global cities like Paris, London and New York, along with winter sun favorites such as Cancun, Dubai and Punta Cana.Story continuesAustralians in particular are more inclined to travel internationally compared to the previous Seasonal Travel Index (+7%). This could be due to seasonality and the recent reduction of COVID-19 restrictions for Australians travelers. American respondents also show a higher propensity for foreign trips compared to the previous Index (+3%).Unsurprisingly, the top ten fastest growing global destinations (those that have seen the largest year-on-year growth) are all based in Asia-Pacific countries, many of which have reopened to international travelers or loosened restrictions over the past 12 months.""Despite rising costs associated with global inflation, traveler appetite shows no sign of slowing as we head into the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere,"" said Alice Jong, Research and Insights Senior Analyst, Media at Tripadvisor.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Energy Stock Picks.Ray Dalio is an American billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds. Dalio is also a noted economic commentator and has written extensively on finance and investing. According to Forbes, Mr. Dalio's real-time net worth is $19.1 billion.The ""Three Big Things"" And Where To Invest According To Ray DalioOn October 12, Ray Dalio appeared in an interview on Bloomberg where he discussed the latest economic situation. According to Mr. Dalio, the U.S. economy is facing ""three big things"". The first is ""the amount of debt and money creation"", and according to Mr. Dalio, central banks have not printed money ""to this degree"" except for the period between 1930 and 1945. The second ""big thing"" is ""the amount of internal conflict"", and Mr. Dalio noted that the U.S. has the largest internal wealth gaps since the period between 1930 and 1945. The third challenge the U.S. economy is faced with is ""international conflict"" and the rising competition from China. Ray Dalio also spoke about the Fed's actions in 2022 and his view of the current situation of the U.S. economy. Mr. Dalio noted that increasing the money supply in the economy ""is stimulative over the short run and depressing over the long run"" since quantitative easing is followed by quantitative tightening. Mr. Dalio noted that ""the Fed and the government have given an enormous amount of debt and credit and created a lurch forward, a giant lurch forward, and created a bubble. And now they are putting on the breaks."" According to Mr. Dalio, the Fed is ""trying to navigate"" between sustainably high inflation and a significant weakening of the economy, and this ""will probably be something like the 70s"". Further, Mr. Dalio spoke about where he would park his cash amid the current economic situation. Here are some comments from Mr. Dalio:Story continues""If I was saving, what would I want to save in? I would like to save in the things that I know I am going to need. So I would like to save in my residence, my house. I would like to save, if I could, pay forward my kid's education, pay forward the food or the healthcare that I can, and so on. I would want to save in those things, to buy forward the things I need most fundamentally.""This article will discuss in detail some of Ray Dalio's top energy stock picks which include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Our MethodologyTo determine billionaire Ray Dalio's top 10 energy stock picks, we reviewed Bridgewater Associates' 13F filings that were updated at the close of the third quarter of 2022. We picked the top 10 energy stocks from Ray Dalio's Q3 2022 investment portfolio and arranged them according to Bridgewater Associates' stake in them. Along with each stock, we have included salient features that make them viable investment options and analyst sentiment as well.Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 10 Energy Stock Picks10. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value: $14,357,000Percentage of Bridgewater Associates' 13F Portfolio: 0.07%Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the United States. As of November 11, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has gained 57.56% year to date and is trading at a PE multiple of 7x.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”Some of billionaire Ray Dalio's top energy stock picks include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).9.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”6.

This is no marketing gimmick – folks need to avoid paralysis by analysis and direct their portfolios based on intuitive dynamics. That’s an overly complicated way of saying don’t fight the current but swim with it.Earlier for InvestorPlace’s Today’s Market segment, I discussed the conundrum that faces the technology sector. Nevertheless, the below sentiment applies perfectly to no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. “In the trailing five years since September 2022, the real M2 money stock expanded over 30%. Put another way, money was “cheap” (or inflationary), so it incentivized business growth. However, in the trailing year, M2 declined over 5%, making money “expensive” (deflationary).”You see, one of the criticisms facing dividend stocks to buy is that the issuing firms redirect money that could be used to expand the business and instead rewards their stakeholders. But guess what? With monetary system tightening, business expansion takes a back seat to stability and earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s why you need to stop thinking too much and consider these no-brainer dividend stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$239.42WMTWalmart$140.74AFLAflac$69.13KOCoca-Cola$59.78CVXChevron$179.47ABBVAbbVie$148.06IBMIBM.$139.18Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comTo succinctly sum up the broader bullish case for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it owns the language of business. When it comes to operating systems for desktops, Microsoft Windows wins hands down with nearly 76% global market share. That’s at the time of writing so it might be different from the time of your reading. Nevertheless, the point stands. For business applications, Microsoft dominates the wider ecosystem.Specifically regarding the case for no-brainer dividend stocks to buy, Microsoft provides a forward yield of 1.21%. No, it’s not something that’s going to make you rich. However, do consider that the company’s payout ratio pings at less than 29%. This reflects that investors can trust the stability and reliability of these admittedly small passive income flows. However, also keep in mind that MSFT shed 33%. In my opinion, it’s a great deal considering the stalwart the company represents.Story continuesMoreover, Gurufocus.com pegs MSFT as a modestly undervalued play based on its proprietary calculations. For me, what stands out is the combination of balance sheet stability (Altman Z-Score of 7.5 or well into the “safe” zone), double-digit revenue growth over the past three years and extremely high quality of business (return on equity of nearly 43%).Walmart (WMT)walmart stockSource: ShutterstockThe big-box retailer that seemingly everyone loves to hate but still shops there anyways, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will become a necessity. I’ll temper this last statement by saying it will likely become a reality based on the aforementioned monetary paradigm shift. As the World Bank pointed out, with international central banks also tightening their currency supplies, a global recession might materialize.In other words, hello everyday low pricing!According to Dividend.com, Walmart offers a forward yield of 1.61%. As with Microsoft above, it’s nothing to write home about. However, the company’s payout ratio pings at 38.3%, which implies a stable and predictable passive income outflow. Just as importantly, WMT offers a slight discount in the market, down almost 4% on a year-to-date basis. Considering the consumer pressure that could be coming our way, WMT may be a steal.Certainly, I think it’s one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. While it’s not the cheapest name out there (trading at 21-times forward earnings), the company enjoys a decently stable balance sheet along with solid margins for the sector. Plus, it’s gaining relevance so capital appreciation from here is not out of the question.Aflac (AFL)Source: ShutterstockOne of the world’s biggest suppliers of supplemental insurance coverage, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) always offered fundamental relevance. Stuff (of the darker, smellier variety) happens in life and Aflac covers financial holes imposed by insurance coverage gaps. Now, the coronavirus pandemic sharply reinforced the idea that stuff can happen at any time. Moreover, it can be utterly devastating, thus cynically bolstering interest toward Aflac.Per Dividend.com, Aflac provides a forward yield of 2.37%. Again, we’re not talking about millionaire-making material here, though it’s an improvement over the other dividend stocks to buy. Currently, Aflac features a payout ratio of just under 30%, reflecting a dependable passive income outflow. Also, keep in mind that the company owns a track record of 39 years of consecutive dividend increases.Another factor to consider for AFL centers on its market performance. Since the start of the year, the security gained nearly 16%. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 shed a very worrying 22% of market value. Part of Aflac’s outperformance stems from the direct correlation between rising rates and rising valuations of insurance stocks.Coca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comIf you had to summarize the U.S. and its distinct take on capitalism, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) would be right up there with this country’s most iconic brands. Indeed, travel pretty much anywhere in the world – for you trolls, I’m not talking about North Korea or other dictatorships – and you’ll see the Coca-Cola imagery plastered throughout major metropolises.At time of writing, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 2.99%. We’re getting into the healthier realm of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy in terms of payout. Now, it does come with a higher rate of risk. Currently, its payout ratio stands at just under 70%. I wouldn’t call it ideal but I also don’t think it’s unstable – just something to watch. Still, on a positive note, Coca-Cola enjoys 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.So yeah, management will likely do whatever it takes to maintain this lofty status.To be fair, KO isn’t cheap, priced at 23-times forward earnings. However, it features a double-digit book growth rate over the last three years. Also, it enjoys very strong margins, bolstering confidence in that yield. Therefore, it’s easily one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAlthough a somewhat controversial figure because of its underlying hydrocarbon business, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) simply represents a necessity at this juncture. Sure, at the end of 2021, we were probably looking forward to building the infrastructure of a clean, renewable future. Well, someone named Vladimir Putin had other ideas regarding global stability. And with Russia blackmailing the west with hydrocarbon outflow cuts, CVX looks cynically attractive.Per Dividend.com, Chevron offers a forward yield of 3.19%. While one of the more generous dividend stocks to buy compared to the major blue chips, it lags the sector average of 4.24%. But here’s the deal with Chevron. First, its payout ratio sits at under 34%. Compared to other energy plays (which features high-yield dividend traps), it’s a solid, dependable ratio. Also, we’re talking about 35 years of consecutive dividend increases.As with some of the other dividend stocks to buy, CVX isn’t cheap. It trades for 11-times forward earnings, ranking it “worse” than over 72% of the industry. However, it features fiscal stability and a very strong return on asset of 13.7%, indicative of a high-quality business.AbbVie (ABBV)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockOne of the pharmaceutical companies that I’ve discussed several times in recent years, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) brings plenty of relevance to the table. However, I’m mostly interested in its Botox unit under its acquisition of Allergan. The benefit here is that as society normalizes, people will inherently prioritize their physical appearance. Cynically, that’s a net positive for ABBV stock.Another checkmark favoring AbbVie centers of course on its inclusion of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of just over 4%. Now, it’s payout ratio pings at 50.5%. From a stability standpoint, it’s not astoundingly great but it’s certainly not something that will keep you up at night. Also, don’t forget that AbbVie features 50 years of consecutive dividend increases.As with the other aristocrats in the space, management will not let that go without a fight.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com rates ABBV as modestly overvalued. However, it trades at 12.6-times forward earnings, which is undervalued for the industry. More broadly, investors will likely focus on its growth and profitability metrics, which are excellent across the board.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVLegacy tech firm IBM (NYSE:IBM) generates some controversy not because of anything it did. Rather, it’s a painfully boring investment. For years, IBM lagged its tech peers as they dove headfirst into cloud computing initiatives. Unfortunately, Big Blue was late to the party. That said, it’s been making up for lost time. As well, it commands leadership in compelling areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.Per Dividend.com, IBM features a forward yield of 4.8%. This ranks very favorably to the tech sector’s average yield of only 1.37%. Investors of dividend stocks to buy should also note that IBM actually gained 1% so far this year. I know, I know – it’s nothing to write home about. However, have you seen the Nasdaq Composite index lately?To be fair, Big Blue also carries a big payout ratio (nearly 69%), which isn’t the most favorable statistic. Still, the bottom line is that the company has 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. No way management will let that stat slip. Finally, IBM offers itself for I would say a more than fair price. Particularly, the stock trades at 14.3-times forward earnings, below the industry median of 22.5 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

130,30f45c3b-4633-3c99-9b15-5e712077f763,GE,2022-11-14,7 Growth Stocks That Are Actually Attractive Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-actually-attractive-174305157.html,1668102185,STORY,"['GE', 'GM', 'FCX', 'IHG', 'SPWR', 'BKNG']","[With macroeconomic trends becoming much more favorable and many growth stocks trading at depressed levels, there are several reasons to believe that growth stocks will soon rally. As a result, longer-term investors should look for growth stocks to buy at this point.Among the favorable macro trends are China’s reopening, impending U.S. government stimulus in the form of the provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the climate law, and a divided government in Washington. Moreover, most economists and prognosticators, from what I’ve heard on television and read online,  appear to believe that the highest Fed interest-rate hikes and inflation jumps are in the rear-view mirror, while the onshoring trend is likely to help many American growth stocks.Here are seven growth stocks to buy that are very well-positioned to benefit from one or more of those positive trends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFCXFreeport-McMoRan$36.50GEGeneral Electric$84.65GMGeneral Motors$40.27EVGOEvgo Inc.$7.16SPWRSunPower$22.31IHGInterContinental Hotels$56.11BKNGBooking Holdings$1,949.26Growth Stocks to Buy: Freeport McMoran (FCX)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has the world’s second-largest copper reserves and more copper reserves than any other U.S.-based company.In recent days, copper prices surged on reports China is looking to reopen its economy by easing its anti-coronavirus measures. In my opinion, those reports are quite credible, so I expect copper prices to continue to climb in the coming days, weeks, and months, sparking similar gains by FCX stock.Moreover, copper, as an essential component of electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines, should get a big lift over the longer term from the world’s efforts to combat climate change.  Meanwhile, the supply of copper is expected to be inadequate to meet the world’s needs over the longer term, S&amp;P Global has reported. Despite all of these strong, positive catalysts, FCX stock has a very low trailing price-earnings ratio of just 13.3.Story continuesGrowth Stocks to Buy: General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn recent days, General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) stock has been climbing as the Street appears to be finally realizing that GE is getting a big lift from pent-up demand for travel and further stability of the healthcare market.Helping, the revenue of the company’s Aerospace unit climbed an impressive 25% year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, to $6.7 billion, as its sales to airlines soared 47% year over year. Moreover, the unit’s margins, excluding acquisitions, jumped 2.8 percentage points year over year to 19%.In addition, investors appear to be pleased with the new, long-term plan unveiled by Boeing (NYSE:BA), one of GE Aerospace’s largest customers. Meanwhile, the outlook of GE’s Power unit has also become bright, as the unit’s orders soared 20% year over year, excluding acquisitions last quarter, and the business should benefit a great deal from the increased use of electricity as the electrification of transportation continues.Growth Stocks to Buy: General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGM (NYSE:GM) recently delivered very strong Q3 results and is becoming a leader in the EV sector. In addition, the automaker last quarter had the highest sales of “SUVs and full-size pickups” in the U.S., and provided full-year EPS guidance, excluding some items, of $6.50-$7.50. At the midpoint of the latter range, GM’s EPS would come in at $7, versus analysts’ previous average estimate of $6.79.Meanwhile, in 2021, the automaker and its joint ventures delivered about 2.9 million vehicles in China. As a result, GM should be a prime beneficiary of the Asian nation’s reopening. On Oct. 26, JPMorgan increased its price target on GM stock to $59 from $58, citing the company’s favorable Q3 results and its “strong execution” despite macro pressures, The Fly reported. The bank kept an “overweight” rating on GM stock.EVgo (EVGO)EV stocks: Electric vehicle logo painted on a blue streetSource: ShutterstockEVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) is a true growth stock, with the EV charging company growing at breakneck speed. In the third quarter, its revenue soared 70% year-over-year to $10.5 million, and it gained about 54,000 new customers, bringing its user base to nearly 500,000. Perhaps more importantly, its network throughput, or the amount of electricity that flowed through its chargers, jumped 51% YOY to 12.1 gigawatt-hours. The latter metric shows that the utilization of its chargers is also growing quickly.According to the company, almost 140 million Americans live within ten miles of one of its fast chargers, showing that its footprint is significant enough to attract millions of more users now. As it deploys more chargers at its partners’ locations, they should become even more accessible to EV owners. (Among the company’s impressive partners are Kroger (NYSE:KR), Safeway, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), all of which have installed EVgo’s chargers at their retail locations). As a result of provisions within the infrastructure law, the company is also likely to receive significant funds from the federal government to build many more chargers.In addition, as I’ve noted in the past, EVgo is partnering closely with GM. Also, as GM’s EV sales increase, EVgo’s top and bottom lines should also climb, boosting EVGO stock in the process.SunPower (SPWR)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockSunPower’s (NASDAQ:SPWR) impressive third-quarter results, reported on Nov. 8, made me a believer in the company. SunPower specializes in selling solar panels to consumers. Its revenue soared 68% year-over-year to $476 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped over 100% YOY to $33 million. And the company’s customer base jumped 63% YOY to 23,100., while it has a total backlog of over 50,000 homes.Further, for all of 2022, the company expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $110 million.Since SunPower has a presence in Europe, it should benefit from the very strong demand for rooftop solar deployments there as the EU implements measures to encourage its citizens to power their homes with solar.Additionally, SunPower, like EVgo, has a partnership with GM that should prove to be very beneficial. Under the deal, “SunPower will be the exclusive solar provider to all GM customers,” said SPWR CEO Peter Faricy on the company’s Q3 earnings call. “We view this as an important new sales channel that capitalizes on the growing interest in rooftop solar that naturally arises from EV ownership,” the CEO added.InterContinental Hotel (IHG)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockFor the last two growth stocks to buy, I’ve chosen names that are benefiting from demand for travel, post-pandemic.One of the firms is the multinational hotel owner InterContinental Hotel (NYSE:ICG).  Among the company’s better-known brands are Regent, Holiday Inn, Candlewood Suites, and Crowne Plaza. Last quarter, it generated impressive earnings per share of $11.74, while its top line soared 52% year-over-year to $1.70 billion. Meanwhile, its operating profit jumped more than 100% year over year to $377 million. That was just only 8% below Q3 of 2019. Finally, its RevPAR, or revenue per available room, jumped 28% versus the same period a year earlier and 2.7% compared with 2019, despite continued, tough coronavirus restrictions in China.As those restrictions ease, IHG’s financial results should improve significantly more going forward. Also noteworthy is that IHG’s CFO, Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson, reported that, “Business travel [in the U.S.] has continued on its trajectory of recovery with revenue in June at a deficit of only 1% to 2019 levels.”Nevertheless, IHG expects its revenue from business travelers to rise further going forward.Booking Holdings (BKNG)two women carrying luggage in an airportSource: Shine Nucha / ShutterstockFormerly known as Priceline, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is an online travel agency that operates many well-known websites, including Priceline, OpenTable, and KAYAK. For the third quarter, the company reported that its top line soared 29% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $5.9 billion. And its earnings per share, excluding some items, soared 41% YOY to $3.03.With the company benefiting from very strong travel trends, its room nights book rose 31% year over year. “We saw an improvement in room night trends as we moved through the [third] quarter,” Booking CEO Glenn Fogel stated, adding that BKNG is “encouraged” by the level of travel reservations for “early 2023.”In a note to investors, trading firm Susquehanna wrote that BKNG reported favorable Q3 results, and the firm kept a “positive” rating on BKNG stock. The firm trimmed its price target on the name to $2,650 from $2,800. The stock closed at $1,859 yesterday.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in FCX, GE, and EVGO.

If you want to see more of the biggest ESG companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest ESG Companies in the World.As the rapid growth of electric vehicles shows, consumers are increasingly interested in environmental sustainability. Although it might cost a little bit more, it is worth it to many consumers if it helps save the environment and fight against climate change.Over the years, investors have also become more interested in sustainability rather than putting just profits first. For ESG investors, it's worth not making as much in profits if it helps make the world more sustainable.Although ESG actually originated in the 1960's as socially responsible investing, ESG investing has grown substantially more in recent decades. One reason is that global warming has become a much bigger problem now than it was in the 1960's. Another reason is that ESG activists can make a much bigger difference given the internet in their calls for more income equality or better corporate governance. With the internet, a lot more people also realize that our world isn't sustainable in its current path unless we help improve it.ESGESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. In ESG investing, investors assess how well a company does in terms of environmental issues such as reducing their carbon emissions, social issues such how companies help their communities, and governance issues such as management diversity.In ESG investing, an investor might choose to invest in a company that does well in ESG issues but has a slightly higher valuation than a company with similar qualities but doesn't do as well in ESG.Given changing consumer behavior, ESG investing can also add value too. McKinsey explains,Although there can be wide discrepancies in practice, including customers who refuse to pay even 1 percent more, we’ve found that upward of 70 percent of consumers surveyed on purchases in multiple industries, including the automotive, building, electronics, and packaging categories, said they would pay an additional 5 percent for a green product if it met the same performance standards as a nongreen alternative. In another study, nearly half (44 percent) of the companies we surveyed identified business and growth opportunities as the impetus for starting their sustainability programs. The payoffs are real. When Unilever developed Sunlight, a brand of dishwashing liquid that used much less water than its other brands, sales of Sunlight and Unilever’s other water-saving products proceeded to outpace category growth by more than 20 percent in a number of water-scarce markets. And Finland’s Neste, founded as a traditional petroleum-refining company more than 70 years ago, now generates more than two-thirds of its profits from renewable fuels and sustainability-related products.Story continues2022Although many ESG companies have growth potential, 2022 has been a tough year for the market. To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts think the central bank could continue to raise it further.While October's inflation was lower than expected and the market has rallied recently, there is still uncertainty and potential downside if economic data fails to meet expectations.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.5 Most Diverse Countries in the WorldMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest ESG Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest stocks from Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) in terms of % of the fund and we reranked them based on their market capitalization as of November 12.

Nevertheless, the below sentiment applies perfectly to no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. “In the trailing five years since September 2022, the real M2 money stock expanded over 30%. Put another way, money was “cheap” (or inflationary), so it incentivized business growth. However, in the trailing year, M2 declined over 5%, making money “expensive” (deflationary).”You see, one of the criticisms facing dividend stocks to buy is that the issuing firms redirect money that could be used to expand the business and instead rewards their stakeholders. But guess what? With monetary system tightening, business expansion takes a back seat to stability and earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s why you need to stop thinking too much and consider these no-brainer dividend stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$239.42WMTWalmart$140.74AFLAflac$69.13KOCoca-Cola$59.78CVXChevron$179.47ABBVAbbVie$148.06IBMIBM.$139.18Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comTo succinctly sum up the broader bullish case for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it owns the language of business. When it comes to operating systems for desktops, Microsoft Windows wins hands down with nearly 76% global market share. That’s at the time of writing so it might be different from the time of your reading. Nevertheless, the point stands. For business applications, Microsoft dominates the wider ecosystem.Specifically regarding the case for no-brainer dividend stocks to buy, Microsoft provides a forward yield of 1.21%. No, it’s not something that’s going to make you rich. However, do consider that the company’s payout ratio pings at less than 29%. This reflects that investors can trust the stability and reliability of these admittedly small passive income flows. However, also keep in mind that MSFT shed 33%. In my opinion, it’s a great deal considering the stalwart the company represents.Story continuesMoreover, Gurufocus.com pegs MSFT as a modestly undervalued play based on its proprietary calculations. For me, what stands out is the combination of balance sheet stability (Altman Z-Score of 7.5 or well into the “safe” zone), double-digit revenue growth over the past three years and extremely high quality of business (return on equity of nearly 43%).Walmart (WMT)walmart stockSource: ShutterstockThe big-box retailer that seemingly everyone loves to hate but still shops there anyways, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will become a necessity. I’ll temper this last statement by saying it will likely become a reality based on the aforementioned monetary paradigm shift. As the World Bank pointed out, with international central banks also tightening their currency supplies, a global recession might materialize.In other words, hello everyday low pricing!According to Dividend.com, Walmart offers a forward yield of 1.61%. As with Microsoft above, it’s nothing to write home about. However, the company’s payout ratio pings at 38.3%, which implies a stable and predictable passive income outflow. Just as importantly, WMT offers a slight discount in the market, down almost 4% on a year-to-date basis. Considering the consumer pressure that could be coming our way, WMT may be a steal.Certainly, I think it’s one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. While it’s not the cheapest name out there (trading at 21-times forward earnings), the company enjoys a decently stable balance sheet along with solid margins for the sector. Plus, it’s gaining relevance so capital appreciation from here is not out of the question.Aflac (AFL)Source: ShutterstockOne of the world’s biggest suppliers of supplemental insurance coverage, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) always offered fundamental relevance. Stuff (of the darker, smellier variety) happens in life and Aflac covers financial holes imposed by insurance coverage gaps. Now, the coronavirus pandemic sharply reinforced the idea that stuff can happen at any time. Moreover, it can be utterly devastating, thus cynically bolstering interest toward Aflac.Per Dividend.com, Aflac provides a forward yield of 2.37%. Again, we’re not talking about millionaire-making material here, though it’s an improvement over the other dividend stocks to buy. Currently, Aflac features a payout ratio of just under 30%, reflecting a dependable passive income outflow. Also, keep in mind that the company owns a track record of 39 years of consecutive dividend increases.Another factor to consider for AFL centers on its market performance. Since the start of the year, the security gained nearly 16%. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 shed a very worrying 22% of market value. Part of Aflac’s outperformance stems from the direct correlation between rising rates and rising valuations of insurance stocks.Coca-Cola (KO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comIf you had to summarize the U.S. and its distinct take on capitalism, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) would be right up there with this country’s most iconic brands. Indeed, travel pretty much anywhere in the world – for you trolls, I’m not talking about North Korea or other dictatorships – and you’ll see the Coca-Cola imagery plastered throughout major metropolises.At time of writing, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 2.99%. We’re getting into the healthier realm of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy in terms of payout. Now, it does come with a higher rate of risk. Currently, its payout ratio stands at just under 70%. I wouldn’t call it ideal but I also don’t think it’s unstable – just something to watch. Still, on a positive note, Coca-Cola enjoys 60 years of consecutive dividend increases.So yeah, management will likely do whatever it takes to maintain this lofty status.To be fair, KO isn’t cheap, priced at 23-times forward earnings. However, it features a double-digit book growth rate over the last three years. Also, it enjoys very strong margins, bolstering confidence in that yield. Therefore, it’s easily one of the no-brainer dividend stocks to buy.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAlthough a somewhat controversial figure because of its underlying hydrocarbon business, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) simply represents a necessity at this juncture. Sure, at the end of 2021, we were probably looking forward to building the infrastructure of a clean, renewable future. Well, someone named Vladimir Putin had other ideas regarding global stability. And with Russia blackmailing the west with hydrocarbon outflow cuts, CVX looks cynically attractive.Per Dividend.com, Chevron offers a forward yield of 3.19%. While one of the more generous dividend stocks to buy compared to the major blue chips, it lags the sector average of 4.24%. But here’s the deal with Chevron. First, its payout ratio sits at under 34%. Compared to other energy plays (which features high-yield dividend traps), it’s a solid, dependable ratio. Also, we’re talking about 35 years of consecutive dividend increases.As with some of the other dividend stocks to buy, CVX isn’t cheap. It trades for 11-times forward earnings, ranking it “worse” than over 72% of the industry. However, it features fiscal stability and a very strong return on asset of 13.7%, indicative of a high-quality business.AbbVie (ABBV)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockOne of the pharmaceutical companies that I’ve discussed several times in recent years, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) brings plenty of relevance to the table. However, I’m mostly interested in its Botox unit under its acquisition of Allergan. The benefit here is that as society normalizes, people will inherently prioritize their physical appearance. Cynically, that’s a net positive for ABBV stock.Another checkmark favoring AbbVie centers of course on its inclusion of no-brainer dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of just over 4%. Now, it’s payout ratio pings at 50.5%. From a stability standpoint, it’s not astoundingly great but it’s certainly not something that will keep you up at night. Also, don’t forget that AbbVie features 50 years of consecutive dividend increases.As with the other aristocrats in the space, management will not let that go without a fight.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com rates ABBV as modestly overvalued. However, it trades at 12.6-times forward earnings, which is undervalued for the industry. More broadly, investors will likely focus on its growth and profitability metrics, which are excellent across the board.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVLegacy tech firm IBM (NYSE:IBM) generates some controversy not because of anything it did. Rather, it’s a painfully boring investment. For years, IBM lagged its tech peers as they dove headfirst into cloud computing initiatives. Unfortunately, Big Blue was late to the party. That said, it’s been making up for lost time. As well, it commands leadership in compelling areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.Per Dividend.com, IBM features a forward yield of 4.8%. This ranks very favorably to the tech sector’s average yield of only 1.37%. Investors of dividend stocks to buy should also note that IBM actually gained 1% so far this year. I know, I know – it’s nothing to write home about. However, have you seen the Nasdaq Composite index lately?To be fair, Big Blue also carries a big payout ratio (nearly 69%), which isn’t the most favorable statistic. Still, the bottom line is that the company has 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. No way management will let that stat slip. Finally, IBM offers itself for I would say a more than fair price. Particularly, the stock trades at 14.3-times forward earnings, below the industry median of 22.5 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

135,30f45c3b-4633-3c99-9b15-5e712077f763,FCX,2022-11-14,7 Growth Stocks That Are Actually Attractive Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-actually-attractive-174305157.html,1668102185,STORY,"['GE', 'GM', 'FCX', 'IHG', 'SPWR', 'BKNG']","[With macroeconomic trends becoming much more favorable and many growth stocks trading at depressed levels, there are several reasons to believe that growth stocks will soon rally. As a result, longer-term investors should look for growth stocks to buy at this point.Among the favorable macro trends are China’s reopening, impending U.S. government stimulus in the form of the provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the climate law, and a divided government in Washington. Moreover, most economists and prognosticators, from what I’ve heard on television and read online,  appear to believe that the highest Fed interest-rate hikes and inflation jumps are in the rear-view mirror, while the onshoring trend is likely to help many American growth stocks.Here are seven growth stocks to buy that are very well-positioned to benefit from one or more of those positive trends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFCXFreeport-McMoRan$36.50GEGeneral Electric$84.65GMGeneral Motors$40.27EVGOEvgo Inc.$7.16SPWRSunPower$22.31IHGInterContinental Hotels$56.11BKNGBooking Holdings$1,949.26Growth Stocks to Buy: Freeport McMoran (FCX)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has the world’s second-largest copper reserves and more copper reserves than any other U.S.-based company.In recent days, copper prices surged on reports China is looking to reopen its economy by easing its anti-coronavirus measures. In my opinion, those reports are quite credible, so I expect copper prices to continue to climb in the coming days, weeks, and months, sparking similar gains by FCX stock.Moreover, copper, as an essential component of electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines, should get a big lift over the longer term from the world’s efforts to combat climate change.  Meanwhile, the supply of copper is expected to be inadequate to meet the world’s needs over the longer term, S&amp;P Global has reported. Despite all of these strong, positive catalysts, FCX stock has a very low trailing price-earnings ratio of just 13.3.Story continuesGrowth Stocks to Buy: General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn recent days, General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) stock has been climbing as the Street appears to be finally realizing that GE is getting a big lift from pent-up demand for travel and further stability of the healthcare market.Helping, the revenue of the company’s Aerospace unit climbed an impressive 25% year-over-year, excluding acquisitions, to $6.7 billion, as its sales to airlines soared 47% year over year. Moreover, the unit’s margins, excluding acquisitions, jumped 2.8 percentage points year over year to 19%.In addition, investors appear to be pleased with the new, long-term plan unveiled by Boeing (NYSE:BA), one of GE Aerospace’s largest customers. Meanwhile, the outlook of GE’s Power unit has also become bright, as the unit’s orders soared 20% year over year, excluding acquisitions last quarter, and the business should benefit a great deal from the increased use of electricity as the electrification of transportation continues.Growth Stocks to Buy: General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGM (NYSE:GM) recently delivered very strong Q3 results and is becoming a leader in the EV sector. In addition, the automaker last quarter had the highest sales of “SUVs and full-size pickups” in the U.S., and provided full-year EPS guidance, excluding some items, of $6.50-$7.50. At the midpoint of the latter range, GM’s EPS would come in at $7, versus analysts’ previous average estimate of $6.79.Meanwhile, in 2021, the automaker and its joint ventures delivered about 2.9 million vehicles in China. As a result, GM should be a prime beneficiary of the Asian nation’s reopening. On Oct. 26, JPMorgan increased its price target on GM stock to $59 from $58, citing the company’s favorable Q3 results and its “strong execution” despite macro pressures, The Fly reported. The bank kept an “overweight” rating on GM stock.EVgo (EVGO)EV stocks: Electric vehicle logo painted on a blue streetSource: ShutterstockEVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) is a true growth stock, with the EV charging company growing at breakneck speed. In the third quarter, its revenue soared 70% year-over-year to $10.5 million, and it gained about 54,000 new customers, bringing its user base to nearly 500,000. Perhaps more importantly, its network throughput, or the amount of electricity that flowed through its chargers, jumped 51% YOY to 12.1 gigawatt-hours. The latter metric shows that the utilization of its chargers is also growing quickly.According to the company, almost 140 million Americans live within ten miles of one of its fast chargers, showing that its footprint is significant enough to attract millions of more users now. As it deploys more chargers at its partners’ locations, they should become even more accessible to EV owners. (Among the company’s impressive partners are Kroger (NYSE:KR), Safeway, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), all of which have installed EVgo’s chargers at their retail locations). As a result of provisions within the infrastructure law, the company is also likely to receive significant funds from the federal government to build many more chargers.In addition, as I’ve noted in the past, EVgo is partnering closely with GM. Also, as GM’s EV sales increase, EVgo’s top and bottom lines should also climb, boosting EVGO stock in the process.SunPower (SPWR)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockSunPower’s (NASDAQ:SPWR) impressive third-quarter results, reported on Nov. 8, made me a believer in the company. SunPower specializes in selling solar panels to consumers. Its revenue soared 68% year-over-year to $476 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped over 100% YOY to $33 million. And the company’s customer base jumped 63% YOY to 23,100., while it has a total backlog of over 50,000 homes.Further, for all of 2022, the company expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $110 million.Since SunPower has a presence in Europe, it should benefit from the very strong demand for rooftop solar deployments there as the EU implements measures to encourage its citizens to power their homes with solar.Additionally, SunPower, like EVgo, has a partnership with GM that should prove to be very beneficial. Under the deal, “SunPower will be the exclusive solar provider to all GM customers,” said SPWR CEO Peter Faricy on the company’s Q3 earnings call. “We view this as an important new sales channel that capitalizes on the growing interest in rooftop solar that naturally arises from EV ownership,” the CEO added.InterContinental Hotel (IHG)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockFor the last two growth stocks to buy, I’ve chosen names that are benefiting from demand for travel, post-pandemic.One of the firms is the multinational hotel owner InterContinental Hotel (NYSE:ICG).  Among the company’s better-known brands are Regent, Holiday Inn, Candlewood Suites, and Crowne Plaza. Last quarter, it generated impressive earnings per share of $11.74, while its top line soared 52% year-over-year to $1.70 billion. Meanwhile, its operating profit jumped more than 100% year over year to $377 million. That was just only 8% below Q3 of 2019. Finally, its RevPAR, or revenue per available room, jumped 28% versus the same period a year earlier and 2.7% compared with 2019, despite continued, tough coronavirus restrictions in China.As those restrictions ease, IHG’s financial results should improve significantly more going forward. Also noteworthy is that IHG’s CFO, Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson, reported that, “Business travel [in the U.S.] has continued on its trajectory of recovery with revenue in June at a deficit of only 1% to 2019 levels.”Nevertheless, IHG expects its revenue from business travelers to rise further going forward.Booking Holdings (BKNG)two women carrying luggage in an airportSource: Shine Nucha / ShutterstockFormerly known as Priceline, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is an online travel agency that operates many well-known websites, including Priceline, OpenTable, and KAYAK. For the third quarter, the company reported that its top line soared 29% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $5.9 billion. And its earnings per share, excluding some items, soared 41% YOY to $3.03.With the company benefiting from very strong travel trends, its room nights book rose 31% year over year. “We saw an improvement in room night trends as we moved through the [third] quarter,” Booking CEO Glenn Fogel stated, adding that BKNG is “encouraged” by the level of travel reservations for “early 2023.”In a note to investors, trading firm Susquehanna wrote that BKNG reported favorable Q3 results, and the firm kept a “positive” rating on BKNG stock. The firm trimmed its price target on the name to $2,650 from $2,800. The stock closed at $1,859 yesterday.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in FCX, GE, and EVGO.

136,c0852b89-9498-40d8-9503-dcd8bc5e3426,PEP,2022-11-14,Demand for chief medical officer roles skyrocketed during pandemic,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hiring-for-chief-medical-officers-skyrocketed-during-pandemic-185322116.html,1668365602,STORY,"['DAL', 'PEP', 'KR', 'CRM']","[Chief medical officers became a hot, new career choice for those with medical training, as employers and federal and local governments, sought an in-house expert as the pandemic swept the country in 2020 and 2021.""The pandemic unleashed a surge of demand for top management talent to fill Chief Medical Officer roles,"" according to ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollack.To date, more than 2,900 jobs were posted in 2022, Pollack added.By comparison, there were only 767 jobs posted pre-pandemic in 2019, and a record 5,000 posted last year.The demand was seen across industries. Healthcare companies saw the need to create or fill the position to help with product and service development, while non-health companies required a clinician for operational and employee health management needs.For some, it was a pivot from a position they already held. For others, it was a career shift altogether.“The reality is, I am the inaugural chief medical officer of this organization. And I am not alone in that fate,” said Antonio Tataranni, chief officer of health and wellness at PepsiCo (PEP). “There have been moments where the weight of the responsibility has been large,” he added.The sudden surge in responsibility for CMOs forged an unofficial roundtable inside corporate America, including Tataranni.Live camera footage of a patient hospitalised with COVID-19 is shown from a computer monitor during a daily meeting lead by Dr. Joseph Varon (not pictured), the chief medical officer at United Memorial Medical Center (UMMC) (REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare)Known informally as the U.S. Roundtable of Chief Medical Officers — which could change as the group hopes to go global —the new crop of C-suite doctors banded together and continue sharing their expertise and information based on the latest data and projections.There are currently about 20 chief medical officers who are part of this group, from industries like airlines, technology, consumer goods, academia, pharmaceutical, and retail. Since it isn't an official group, the companies declined to be named.Breakneck speedOne of the biggest responsibilities these medical experts had included fighting misinformation and disinformation, as well as advising executives on operational decisions.Story continuesDelta’s (DAL) chief health and well-being officer, Dr. Henry Ting said he never thought he’d ever be working for a company, much less an airline. But he was still able to maneuver the new role.“This was sort of an existential threat to Delta airlines, in terms of duration and severity,"" Ting said. ""Our revenue and passenger rides dropping 95% in 30 days, almost the opposite of what Lysol (RBGLY) and Purell saw.""So Ting formed a strategic relationship with all of Delta’s executives and began the process of trying to look four weeks ahead and decide how the company should operate at all levels. That led to decisions like blocking the middle seat on flights, to changed HEPA filters or setting up testing and vaccine sites for employees.Deloitte's Ken Abrams executed a different strategy, but one that was equally inclusive. Abrams found himself needing to ""educate a group of people who never ever in their lives imagined that they were going to need a science-based education.""Sanathan Aiyadurai, 27, and Diego Montelongo, 27, who are medical students, review a COVID-19 patient's status during a daily meeting lead by Dr. Joseph Varon, 58, the chief medical officer at United Memorial Medical Center (UMMC) REUTERS/Callaghan O'HareThe team built a mini medical school program to help educate executive leadership about immunology, physiology, virology, and epidemiology.Information and vaccine accessPepsi, like other large multinational corporations, had one key advantage in gaining knowledge about the virus — it operates in hundreds of countries. So when waves of Covid hit different parts of the world, Pepsi had eyes on the ground to understand the situation, and how to respond accordingly.“It was very clear that information was developing at a breakneck speed, and differently in different parts of the world,” Pepsi's Tataranni, who is also senior vice president of life sciences, said.“In the very beginning, our Chinese colleagues were really the coaches that were telling us (what would) happen,"" he said.Over time, the local teams were allowed to decide how to handle the situation on the ground during surges. Sometimes, the role went beyond keeping abreast of the latest information. In some cases, Pepsi found itself at the center of the vaccine acquisition battles globally.“At some point, some of the more money-strapped governments started reaching out to a private corporation, especially at the time of deployment of vaccines. So we had to navigate a little bit of the vaccine diplomacy,” Tataranni said.All of these were beyond the normal experiences for a former endocrinologist who was hired to head Pepsi’s research and development.But the workload didn’t end there. Tataranni also found himself in the interviewer’s chair, launching a Q&amp;A series with experts that was broadcast internally and available for all employees internationally.Chief clinical officer John Corman MD at Virginia Mason administers a dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at the Amazon Meeting Center in downtown Seattle, Washington on January 24, 2021. (Photo by Grant HINDSLEY / AFP) (Photo by GRANT HINDSLEY/AFP via Getty Images)Ting also had a range of sources. He relied on his peer network developed over years at large clinical systems as he maneuvered being able to balance the business and operations with the science. That included contacts at the CDC, Emory, Stanford, Mass General, and Mayo Clinic.“Sometimes the science is not always so clear, or black and white. In fact, usually, it isn’t. Particularly in something like Covid, where everything was a curveball, and you never knew what was around the corner,” he said.That’s where Ting sees the future of the CMO role in companies. Where once, doctors that held the role were more occupational health advisers, they are now advising the entire C-suite on operations. And that, Ting said, has elevated the role to a point where it is likely to remain.Long term impactSalesforce (CRM) chief medical officer Geeta Nayyar said the trust and relationships built during the pandemic will lend themselves to more impactful efforts of keeping employees healthy.""Companies want to do exactly what we're doing which is make their employees smart about health care, and it's expensive. Health care is a huge cost on the balance sheet,"" Nayyar said.Kroger's (KR) chief medical officer, Marc Watkins, who has been in the role since 2018, sees only growth in the near future.""I don't think employers today are going to move away from chief physician executive or chief medical officer roles if they can add them at this point. Just because of the uncertainty moving out of the pandemic,"" Watkins said.""Given what you're seeing in the market with them hiring or non-traditional organization bring on physician leadership, I feel like we see that continue. It won't be business as usual,"" he added.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

If you want to explore similar tech companies, you can also take a look at 5 Biggest Tech Companies In The World After the 2022 Stock Market Collapse.2022 has been a bad year for the stock market. What started off as minor inflation has now reached 40-year highs. The Fed's reaction to the alarmingly high inflation rate sent reverberations to the equities market and caused rampant sell-offs, with all major market indices declining. Russia's invasion of Ukraine played a role in driving the downtrend in emerging markets, and a further catalyst was the dollar, which has remained strong throughout 2022.The Worst Might Be Over, Markets Rally On Weak CPI ReportOn November 10, The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI report for October which showed signs of the economy cooling. The all-items index rose 7.7% year over year, the smallest twelve-month increase since the period ending January 2022. The all items less food and energy index recorded an increase of 6.3% year over year, the energy index rose 17.6% over the twelve months ending October, and the food index increased 10.9% over the past twelve months. All of these components declined from the numbers that came out in September. Some experts are saying inflation may have peaked and the markets rallied on a weak CPI print for October, with the S&amp;P 500 going back up to 3,900, the Dow surging to 33,400, and the Nasdaq rising to 10,900.""We Are Starting To See Some Benefits That The Fed Is Looking For""Shortly after the CPI report for October was released, Jefferies' chief market strategist David Zervos appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed his take on the inflation data and what to expect from the Fed moving forward. Zervos noted that the weak CPI report ""is a lot of relief"" and that now we are in a ""fine-tuning phase"" since ""we have done the heavy lifting, we have had 400 basis points done already"". For year-end, Zervos sees the Fed raising rates by another 50 basis points or potentially 75 basis points and said that ""we have a lot of QT (quantitative tightening) to get through"". Zervos noted that ""there's a lot of tightening in the hopper"" and that ""we are starting to see some benefits that the Fed is looking for"" and this is good for the markets.Story continuesTech companies have been hammered hard in 2022, and their valuations have suffered due to the higher borrowing costs.

For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.8bUS$16.7bUS$16.6bUS$16.3bUS$17.0bUS$17.2bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.91%Est @ 1.23%Est @ 1.46%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$14.7kUS$14.5kUS$13.4kUS$12.3kUS$12.0kUS$11.3kUS$10.7kUS$10.1kUS$9.6kUS$9.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$118bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$354bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$354b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$176bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$294b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$44.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?
