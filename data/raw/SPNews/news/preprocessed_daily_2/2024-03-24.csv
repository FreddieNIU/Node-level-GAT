The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Edwards Lifesciences’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ', 'Edwards Lifesciences appears to be overvalued by 22% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$93.79 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $76.82. This means that the opportunity to buy Edwards Lifesciences at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Edwards Lifesciences’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Edwards Lifesciences' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 43%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in EW’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe EW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EW for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for EW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here."", 'If you are no longer interested in Edwards Lifesciences, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The budget is stated to be set aside to meet the Foundation\'s goal to ""save and improve"" millions of lives by 2030. Bill Gates has long been an admirable philanthropist alongside being an innovator in the technology sector. Yet, this move signifies an extraordinary commitment to meeting the greatest and most urgent human needs worldwide. The annual letter noted that the Gates Foundation measures its impact in the field of philanthropy in terms of ""lives saved and livelihood improved,"" a measurement that has now culminated in the multi-billion dollar budget being decided.', ""Not long after the Foundation's announcement, Gates met with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at the World Economic Forum to discuss his commitment to ensuring the world's poorest are helped. An interesting facet of his discussion was the focus on artificial intelligence (AI) in this endeavor. To begin with, Gates noted that AI may not be perfect at present, but its progress and development are continuing at quite a dramatic pace. He further stated that if AI were to be inculcated in the medical and education sectors, the results would be fantastic, particularly with regard to narrowing the gap in the provision of vital services in these sectors in less developed countries versus developed ones."", ""Considering Gates' immense support for AI and its projected benefits, it is unsurprising that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the leading companies in this space at present, not just from a profitability viewpoint but also in terms of the benefits that can be derived from this technology in areas such as education. However, a look at Bill Gates' stock portfolio shows that the billionaire philanthropist isn't just a tech investor. His latest holdings show large stakes in\xa0Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) and Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), for instance, highlighting the portfolio's diversification. Over the past year, Gates' top holdings have remained largely the same, which also shows a consistent portfolio management approach headed by Michael Larson."", ""Bill Gates' stock portfolio is worth over $42 billion at present, with a large portion of the portfolio consisting of technology stocks, followed closely by industrial goods stocks, financial stocks, and services stocks. Considering that these are the areas consistently held by the Foundation Trust, which has a history of positive performance both financially and philanthropically, investors may be well-served by following current developments in these areas in order to buy into them. This year, technology has remained a top performer in the US equity markets at any rate, making this area a top investment opportunity that must be considered.

Investors looking for passive income may be turning to stocks with higher yields and track records of dividend raises."", 'Walmart (NYSE: WMT), WM (NYSE: WM) (formerly known as Waste Management), and Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) consistently buy back shares and raise their dividends. But they now yield less than the S&P 500.', ""Here's why these three dividend stocks are too successful for their own good, and why great companies can become poor sources of income over time."", 'Walmart is hovering around an all-time high. After a successful 3-for-1 stock split, Walmart raised its dividend by 9%, marking the largest raise in over a decade and the 51st consecutive dividend raise. Still, Walmart only pays an $0.83-per-share quarterly dividend, which is a mere 1.3% yield.', ""Prior to this, Walmart had made close to bare minimum annual raises. But that's mostly because it has been reinvesting in its stores and improving the underlying business. The strategy has mostly worked."", ""Walmart's revenue is up over 25% in the last five years -- a fairly big move for a company its size. Its operating margin is back over 4%, which makes a big difference for its profitability."", ""However, Walmart's trailing-12-month net income is surprisingly lower today than it was a decade ago because Walmart has increased its capital expenditures (capex). In fact, capex has nearly doubled in just three years!"", ""If Walmart wasn't spending so much on capex, it would be generating record profits. But long-term investors care more about where a company's profits are years from now than what they are today."", 'Aside from store expansions, Walmart has invested heavily in store pickup and delivery through its Walmart+ program. In fiscal 2024, Walmart passed $100 billion in global e-commerce sales for the first time, meaning e-commerce made up over 15% of total sales.', ""Walmart is investing in supply chain automation and remodeling 928 stores and Sam's Clubs over the next year. These improvements have come at a steep cost, which makes Walmart look expensive. But if they work out, they could set the stage for plenty of growth and dividend raises in the future."", 'WM handles the entire waste management value chain, from collection to transportation, separation, treatment, and reuse. The business is pretty self-explanatory, until recently when the reuse side of the equation has expanded far beyond recycling.', ""Similar to Walmart, WM's capex has exploded in recent years, doubling over the last three years. The company's capex growth rate has far exceeded its net income growth rate, which makes sense given WM won't see a return on some of these investments for years."", ""The big driver of WM's investments is sustainability through recycling projects and renewable natural gas (RNG)."", 'Landfill gas (LFG) is produced when bacteria break down organic waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, LFG contains about 50% methane and 50% carbon dioxide -- not a good combination when released directly into the atmosphere. WM is working on trapping and processing that LFG into pipeline quality gas that can be reused. The sustainable process is why the finished product is called ""renewable"" natural gas.', 'RNG production is far more expensive than fossil-based gas. But there are credits to make RNG a good investment. On its Q4 2023 earnings call, WM discussed the stability of the credit program and why credits can be stacked together to make the program more profitable. WM is a leader in the LFG to RNG industry, which has decades of potential especially as the pace of the energy transition accelerates.', 'WM is putting up excellent numbers despite these long-term investments. Profits are near an all-time high and margins have recovered from the pandemic-induced slowdown. WM stock has rather quietly surged over 108% in the last five years, outperforming the S&P 500. The company has made meaningful raises to its dividend, and returned $2.44 billion to shareholders in 2023, but the yield is low because the stock has done so well and WM is investing in long-term growth, not just the dividend.', ""Over the last decade, Sherwin-Williams has increased its dividend by nearly fourfold, WM's has doubled, and Walmart's is up less than 30%. However, Walmart has reduced its share count by more than WM or Sherwin-Williams."", 'Sherwin-Williams is also the best performing of the three, crushing the S&P 500 over the last five years. Pretty good for a paint company in what has been a growth-stock-fueled rally in the broader market.', 'Sherwin-Williams has achieved breakneck revenue growth while keeping its margins fairly high. The key has been margin growth across its business units, especially its largest segment, the paint stores group (PSG). PSG -- which used to be called ""the Americas group"" -- centers around Sherwin-Williams stores that cater to industrial, commercial, and residential customers.', ""The consumer brands group contains products not under the Sherwin-Williams name, like Cabot, Valspar, and others. The segment boomed during the height of the pandemic as folks undertook DIY projects. The segment's sales and profits fell in the most recent quarter, but they are still up substantially from a few years ago, which illustrates how the company has been able to grow despite difficult comps."", 'The performance coatings group is the segment you may be least familiar with since it targets industrial and commercial customers. Sherwin-Williams makes coatings for everything from ships to machinery and equipment, you name it.', ""Sherwin-Williams' dividend is up 90% in the last five years, but because the stock has outpaced this growth, the yield has fallen."", 'Walmart, WM, and Sherwin-Williams are excellent examples of how an investment thesis can change for good reasons.', 'All three companies have grown nicely, put up solid returns for investors, and still have sizable capital return programs with dividends and buybacks. But because the focus is more on growth, these stocks are no longer suitable passive income plays.', ""That doesn't mean that they aren't good investments, but it does mean investors must realign their expectations based on the new direction."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

The redemptions began amid the market volatility in 2022. However, the company had a process to limit a ""run"" on the fund, and redemption requests have slowed down significantly this year.', 'Blackstone did a solid job of navigating market volatility and has grown its AUM from $881 million in 2021 to over $1 trillion last year, showing demand from investors for alternative investments remains robust.', 'Growth in this area is likely to continue, too.

If you want to skip our introduction to the Australian stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best ASX Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""With a market capitalization of $1.5 trillion, the Australian stock exchange, also called the ASX, is one of the biggest stock exchanges in the world. It is run and managed by the Sydney, Australia based financial services firm ASX Limited (ASX:ASX.AX), and like other stock exchanges, the ASX's composition along with the most valuable companies listed in Australia is somewhat a reflection of the Australian economy."", ""For instance, the most valuable publicly traded company in Australia is the global mining giant BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP). Its latest market capitalization sits at $141 billion, and the firm's top spot in valuation terms is unsurprising given the crucial role that mining plays in the Australian economy. However, when we move further down the ladder of the most valuable Australian stocks, and particularly those that trade on the ASX, the list becomes a bit more diversified and ends up showcasing the advanced nature of Australia's business sector."", 'To understand this, consider the most valuable ASX stocks after BHP. These are Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX:CBA.AX), CSL Limited (ASX:CSL.AX), National Australia Bank Limited (ASX:NAB.AX), and Westpac Banking Corporation (ASX:WBC.AX). This shows us that the most valuable Australian companies include banks and surprisingly, a biotechnology company. While Australian banking giants, such as the behemoth Macquarie Group Limited (ASX:MQG.AX) are known the world over for their portfolios and services, the country is rarely associated with having a prosperous biotechnology sector - an industry mostly linked with European countries such as Denmark.', 'This top ASX biotechnology stock belongs to CSL Limited, a Melbourne based company with a market capitalization of A$135 and a product lineup covering gene therapies, kidney medicines, and other products. And just like their American counterparts, stocks on the ASX are also sensitive to news about macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates and inflation.', ""In fact, these have created somewhat of a roller coaster picture for ASX stocks. While Australia is a developed country, its proximity to China and vast geographical distance from the rest of the developed Western world means that Australian businesses have to rely on the Asian economic superpower for their fortunes. Additionally, just like other developed nations, Australia has also suffered from the twin troubles of high inflation and worrying GDP growth, particularly when it comes to GDP per capita. For those out of the loop, a nation's GDP per capita measures the economic output per person living inside its borders, and for Australia, the GDP per capita in US dollars has been in a down trend since 2013."", 'The third quarter of 2023 also marked the third consecutive quarterly GDP per capita drop in Australia, a trend that previously surfaced roughly two decades back. Similarly, growth in Australia has also been slowing down, but due to the country being blessed with natural resources, has nevertheless managed to avoid the weak picture painted elsewhere in the developed world. For the full year 2023, the Australian GDP grew by 1.5%, while posting a more modest 0.2% growth in Q4.', ""The relatively modest growth figures which ended up meeting economic estimates have also placed the Royal Bank of Australia (the Australian central bank) at the center of media, investor, and analyst attention. Many believe that further interest rate hikes at a time when Australian consumers are digging into their savings to keep up spending would be unnecessary. On this front, a fresh report from Bloomberg believes that the RBA will continue to hold interest rates at 4.35% since inflation is higher than the bank's preferred range of 2% to 3%."", 'So the next question to ask is how well are Australian stocks doing in a period of tepid economic growth and consumer pain. On this front, the S&P/ASX 200, an index of Australian stocks maintained by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) provides some insight. The index has gained a modest 11% over the past twelve months, and its year-to-date performance (flat) shows that investors are wary about the prospects of China, Australian interest rates, and economic growth. In fact, the S&P/ASX 200 has posted just 7.5% in gains since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving much to be desired particularly when we consider the heavy hitting American stock indexes.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top Australian and ASX stocks to buy.

The budget is stated to be set aside to meet the Foundation\'s goal to ""save and improve"" millions of lives by 2030. Bill Gates has long been an admirable philanthropist alongside being an innovator in the technology sector. Yet, this move signifies an extraordinary commitment to meeting the greatest and most urgent human needs worldwide. The annual letter noted that the Gates Foundation measures its impact in the field of philanthropy in terms of ""lives saved and livelihood improved,"" a measurement that has now culminated in the multi-billion dollar budget being decided.', ""Not long after the Foundation's announcement, Gates met with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at the World Economic Forum to discuss his commitment to ensuring the world's poorest are helped. An interesting facet of his discussion was the focus on artificial intelligence (AI) in this endeavor. To begin with, Gates noted that AI may not be perfect at present, but its progress and development are continuing at quite a dramatic pace. He further stated that if AI were to be inculcated in the medical and education sectors, the results would be fantastic, particularly with regard to narrowing the gap in the provision of vital services in these sectors in less developed countries versus developed ones."", ""Considering Gates' immense support for AI and its projected benefits, it is unsurprising that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the leading companies in this space at present, not just from a profitability viewpoint but also in terms of the benefits that can be derived from this technology in areas such as education. However, a look at Bill Gates' stock portfolio shows that the billionaire philanthropist isn't just a tech investor. His latest holdings show large stakes in\xa0Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

With some skepticism rising that Apple may have missed the boat on AI, recent details over the company's plans have emerged from a Bloomberg report."", ""Below I'll dig into how Apple may be pursuing AI and assess what this could mean for an investment in the stock."", ""Microsoft kicked off the AI race with a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT.

This wasn't entirely surprising given Alphabet and Amazon each compete in cloud computing with Microsoft."", 'But Apple, which missed out on the cloud revolution,\xa0remained suspiciously quiet during the frenzy of AI investments.', ""While Apple hasn't revealed its AI vision publicly, Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has theorized the company could leverage AI capabilities into its App Store.\xa0Earlier this month, investors at least got a small preview of how Apple may be making inroads in AI. The company acquired a Canadian start-up called DarwinAI, which develops technology used to identify defects in hardware devices during manufacturing."", ""Based on Ives's theory that Apple may rely on AI for future growth in the App Store, it makes sense that the company would bolster its quality assurance capabilities in its line of hardware devices -- which have experienced shrinking growth during the past year. Following the acquisition of Darwin AI, a report published by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is in talks with both Alphabet and OpenAI to potentially run their generative AI models on the iPhone."", 'Apple working with either Alphabet or OpenAI was not something I saw coming. The company is perhaps most famous for its relentless commitment to product innovation. For this reason, it has adopted a closed system, developing technology in-house and rarely outsourcing. This is why I remain incredulous over a potential deal with Alphabet or OpenAI.', ""At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I think this is a make-or-break scenario for Apple. All of the company's big tech peers have made breakthroughs in AI. This has left Apple in an unenviable game of catch-up -- all while growth stalls."", 'Working with other AI companies could merely be an illusion.

It's very hard to bet against a company that has such a prolific history when it comes to marrying software to consumer electronics. If Apple is using a strategic relationship with other AI developers as the catalyst for a more meaningful breakthrough down the road, it could be the first chapter of a much-needed comeback story."", ""However, with shares trading at 26 times forward earnings, Apple stock is more expensive than both Alphabet and the S&P 500.

That quality, paired with each company\'s size, led Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to coin the phrase ""Magnificent Seven"" to refer to Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). But 2024 has been entirely different.', 'Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla are underperforming both benchmarks, with Apple losing over 8% of its value year to date. Tesla has been the most contentious component of the Magnificent Seven because it is the worst-performing S&P stock YTD, down over 30% in less than three months. Even Boeing, whose stock tumbled following a series of high-profile maintenance issues, is doing slightly better than Tesla stock.', 'Nvidia is the single best-performing stock in the S&P 500, and Meta Platforms is third.', ""Here's why some Magnificent Seven stocks are out of favor, what you can learn from the Magnificent Seven, and whether investing in the Magnificent Seven is right for you."", 'In 2022, the Nasdaq Composite and many big tech stocks suffered brutal inflation-driven sell-offs as recession fears spread like wildfire. The market breathed a sigh of relief in 2023 when inflation started coming down, and there was a path toward the Federal Reserve cutting rates.', 'Widespread adoption of ChatGPT gave the market a new theme to get excited about: artificial intelligence (AI). AI is nothing new, but the proliferation of AI tools in the workplace and for everyday tasks is.', ""Wall Street can get enamored by a hot trend, creating tunnel vision and ignoring opportunities that fall outside the construct. The Magnificent Seven components that are leveraging AI and have a clear roadmap for using AI to fuel earnings growth have been rewarded. Those that don't, namely Apple and Tesla, have been punished."", 'In my opinion, the companies with the best AI potential focus on business-to-business sales more than business-to-consumer sales.', ""Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft mainly sell software and digital ads. Meta Platforms' social media platforms Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp primarily cater to consumers, but the revenue comes from ads sold to companies. Nvidia sells a physical product (the computing power necessary to support complex AI models) to companies."", ""Amazon's e-commerce arm depends on consumers, but Amazon Web Services is the cloud infrastructure leader and arguably the most valuable part of the business."", 'Meanwhile, Apple and Tesla depend on selling physical products, mainly iPhones for Apple and electric vehicles (EVs) for Tesla. Selling physical products to consumers is the hardest way to monetize AI. Yes, there are exceptions, but this has so far been the case with the AI boom.', ""Tesla doesn't have a clear way to monetize AI in the near term. Its best bets are long-term, fully autonomous driving and robotaxis, but that industry remains unproven."", ""Apple also doesn't have a clear AI roadmap. Sure, Apple will probably integrate AI into its future devices, and the company is doing an excellent job of growing its high-margin services segment. But overall, Apple and Tesla haven't been able to capitalize on AI meaningfully, which may not change anytime soon simply because of the nature of their business models."", ""In fact, analysts are forecasting next-to-no growth for Apple in the short term, which is why its price-to-earnings ratio is nearly the same as its forward P/E. Tesla's forward P/E ratio is lower, implying negative growth."", 'Tesla stock had a lot in common with its other big-tech-focused peers. But the business is totally different.', 'Investors who piled into Tesla all because it was part of the Magnificent Seven have been burned. The sell-off is a good lesson on why chasing a hot trend or assuming a stock will stay correlated when the underlying companies are so different is never a good idea.', ""Tesla's sell-off has been severe not only because it has been left out of the AI theme but also because it is facing growing competition from pure-play EV companies and legacy automakers alike. It has been battling a price war for a while now, with further price cuts expected to fend off slowing demand and low-cost offerings in China, namely from BYD. At this stage, Tesla has lost its first-mover advantage, so its supply chain, manufacturing expertise, unique product features, and brand will be more important than ever. Consumers interested in EVs have more choices -- a reality that Tesla has to accept."", 'Even after the sell-off, Tesla remains the most expensive Magnificent Seven stock on a forward P/E ratio basis.', ""With the growth story falling apart, at least in the short term, it is understandable why some investors are running for the exits. But as bad as it looks, the long-term investment thesis for Tesla hasn't changed."", 'Tesla is focused on rapidly scaling production to meet the needs of sustained EV adoption. The adoption rate depends on consumer interest and government mandates/subsidies for EVs. For Tesla to unlock long-term growth, it must play a central role in the energy transition through EVs, EV charging, renewable energy, energy storage, and more.', 'Right now, EV demand has slowed.

But no one can argue that it hasn't become a significant advantage over its competitors today. Microsoft has woven OpenAI's technology right into its various software products. Additionally, the partnership funnels all OpenAI compute needs through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform."", 'OpenAI has expanded beyond its large language model ChatGPT to recently launched video creation engine Sora and humanoid robotics via a joint venture between OpenAI, Nvidia, and Microsoft with start-up robotics company Figure.', ""It's not like Microsoft needs the upside that tying up with OpenAI provides. We're talking about a $3 trillion company with deeper pockets than almost any business on Earth and a better credit rating than the U.S. government. It's also one that generates roughly $70 billion in free cash flow annually, more than most companies accumulate in revenue."", ""Perhaps it's only natural that such a technology juggernaut would happen to partner with the company that turned into arguably the leader in AI innovation today. You have plenty of reasons outside OpenAI to buy and hold Microsoft forever. However, the long-term potential upside of AI and all the ways OpenAI brings Microsoft to that dance are undoubtedly good reasons to believe Microsoft's future is bright."", 'Will Healy (Qualcomm): Qualcomm may have become the forgotten AI chip stock. Most of the focus has fallen to Nvidia, and understandably so, due to its dominant market share.', 'Nonetheless, devices of all kinds will serve as platforms for generative AI, and Qualcomm-supported phones are no exception. The company has just released its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which supports AI models that support as many as 10 billion parameters from one\'s smartphones. The chip\'s capabilities also allow it to create pictures enhanced by AI, engage in ""console-defying"" mobile gaming, or listen to studio-quality audio, all from one\'s device.', ""But Qualcomm doesn't rely exclusively on smartphones. The company has extended its capabilities into the Internet of Things and automotive chips and has begun to develop processors for laptops and tablets. Those products should ultimately expand Qualcomm's AI capabilities."", 'The company is coming out of a slump in the chip industry and an uncertain economy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 24, 2023), revenue of $9.9 billion rose by 5% year over year. This came after a 19% decline in fiscal 2023. Fortunately, it remains profitable as fiscal Q1 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income rose 24% yearly to $2.7 billion.', ""Looking at the stock performance, it's hard to say whether investors are reacting to its AI potential or lackluster finances in recent quarters. The stock is up 35% over the last year. While impressive, it dramatically underperformed other AI chip stocks such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices."", ""Nonetheless, with a P/E ratio of 24 and a forward P/E ratio of 17, one can argue that Qualcomm is attractively priced, particularly when considering AMD's forward earnings multiple of 50 or Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 37."", ""That valuation could give investors a chance to buy into an AI chip stock at an attractive price. Also, at $165 per share, investors with a $1,000 budget have the opportunity to purchase a few shares before more investors notice Qualcomm's AI capabilities."", ""Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Up 41% year to date, Meta Platforms is nevertheless an under-the-radar AI stock. This dichotomy is related to Meta's biggest strength -- it paradoxically combines the traits of a cash cow and a tech start-up."", ""First, consider Meta's cash-cow advertising business. The company generated nearly $135 billion in revenue last year, nearly all of it coming from advertising across its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms. Thanks to Meta's asset-light business model, 35% of that revenue, or $47 billion, was converted into operating profit. That's a fantastic rate, and it helps explain why the company introduced a regular dividend payment for shareholders."", ""Yet, Meta is more than just a profitable tech giant. The company is investing billions of dollars in AI research. In fact, Meta is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia's flagship AI chip, the H100. None other than founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would be running upwards of 350,000 H100s this year to train its AI models."", 'What does Meta need with all that computing power? Well, it has several ambitious goals, such as perfecting its version of the metaverse and developing Artificial General Intelligence.', 'That, in a nutshell, gives Meta investors lots to be excited about, such as the potential for explosive growth -- if the company ever achieves its ambitious AI goals -- combined with a river of cash flow thanks to its legacy social media business.', 'In short, Meta is the type of AI stock investors can buy now and hold for years to come.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And if one takes out the $4.1 billion in operating losses from Alphabet\'s ""other bets"" segment consisting of moonshot projects, Alphabet would have come very close to Microsoft\'s $82.5 billion profit over the past 12 months.', 'Looking at all the dividend-paying Mag Seven stocks side by side, it seems apparent Alphabet is rather overdue for a dividend.', 'Company', 'Net Income (TTM)', 'Dividend Yield ', 'Payout Ratio', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', '$100.9 billion', '0.55%', '14.8%', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', '$82.5 billion', '0.71%', '25.2%', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)', '$73.8 billion', '0%', '0%', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', '$39.1 billion', '0.40%', '13.4%', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', '$29.8 billion', '0.16%', '1.3%', 'Data source: Yahoo! Finance.', ""Not only does Alphabet have the earnings power to pay shareholders a dividend, but it also has the biggest balance sheet cushion of any Mag Seven company. As of December, Alphabet had a whopping $111 billion in cash against just $13 billion in debt. That's actually the highest level of net cash in the group. The next most cash-rich company is Apple. Although Apple has a higher level of total cash and securities at around $173 billion, it also had a higher debt load, at around $108 billion."", 'To its credit, Alphabet has been returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In fact, Alphabet returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders through buybacks last year, retiring $71 billion of its stock, including offsets for share compensation.', ""But all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also repurchasing a fair amount of stock, with most (except Microsoft) paying more in share repurchases than dividends. And with Alphabet's closest peer, Meta Platforms, just initiating its first dividend last month, Alphabet may be running out of excuses in holding out."", 'Some may find it may be appropriate for Alphabet to stick with 100% repurchases for now. After all, Alphabet is currently the cheapest of all the Magnificent Seven stocks on both a P/E and forward P/E basis. And the cheaper a stock is, the more accretive share repurchases are, with the ability to retire more shares.', ""That being said, even using 100% of its earnings for repurchases would retire only about 4.5% of Alphabet's stock this year. Whereas using Microsoft's payout ratio would give shareholders a 1.1% dividend yield. That would be the highest among the Mag Seven and wouldn't be a bad yield at all for an AI-fueled tech stock. It could also open up Alphabet to a larger pool of investors, attracting dividend-focused mutual and index funds."", 'Of course, Alphabet management may be hesitant to begin paying a dividend at this point. After all, the stock has lagged other Mag Seven names based on fears that generative artificial intelligence could pose a threat to its core search business.', ""I think that fear is misplaced, as we're still in the early innings of the AI era, and Alphabet has recently upped its game with an upgraded version of its in-house large language model called Gemini 1.5. According to the company, the new Gemini model can understand more video, text, audio, and computer code in an instant than the latest version of ChatGPT-4. In fact, it was recently rumored that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for iPhones, much in the way Apple already has Google as the default search engine on iPhones."", ""Yet while there are positive signs Alphabet's AI products are gaining traction, the buildout of Gemini, Google Cloud, and general AI capabilities will take lots of capital. Therefore, Alphabet may be in for an aggressive spending cycle to capture the AI opportunity that may necessitate management holding off on paying a regular dividend at this point in time."", ""Still, the buildout of AI infrastructure and the Metaverse investment didn't prevent Meta from starting its own dividend. Two years ago, Meta management was criticized for overspending, so the new nominal payout was perhaps a gesture to shareholders that Meta will remain disciplined in its investments."", 'Alphabet has also been criticized as perhaps being a bit bloated in terms of its employee count and spending on various ""moonshot"" tech projects. So, the initiation of a dividend could go a long way in changing that perception for Alphabet as well.', 'Once Alphabet management believes its AI offerings have gained sufficient traction, I would expect the company to perhaps begin a quarterly payout.', 'While it may not happen in 2024, investors in Alphabet today are likely to see a growing payout beginning sometime in the next few years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

On Wednesday night, the IPO priced at $34 per share, netting $748 million in proceeds.

Noting that Reddit and others — like Instacart\'s parent company Maplebear (CART) — had to take ""down rounds,"" or receive valuations lower than their prior fundraising level, during their IPOs, many companies will remain reluctant to test the public market.', 'Veteran tech reporter Dan Primack at Axios argued Friday that this week\'s fundraises — which saw more than $5 billion raised globally — mean ""we\'re done with \'waiting until market conditions improve\' or \'uncertainty.\' If a company has the numbers or story to go public, the only impediment is inertia.""', 'And I think both arguments are right.', 'Companies go public for many reasons. Some need to raise capital. Others need liquidity for early investors and employees. Others may be spun out from some kind of private ownership structure.', 'For venture-backed companies, the class from which Reddit emerged, avoiding a down round is certainly the goal. Moreover, many companies raised oodles of cash during the pandemic, making the need for more money a problem for tomorrow. And, whether venture-backed or not, no company wants its value to go down over time.', ""But investors and employees of Reddit were (and are!) sitting on windfalls that only the liquidity of the public market can make real. Even if the valuation falls short of yesterday's high-water mark."", ""And on Primack's point that, essentially, excuses from management teams about why their IPO must be delayed won't hold water in today's market, Reddit's debut is proof positive."", ""The company's valuation is down about 25% from its fundraising two and a half years ago. But the issue was well-received — shares priced at the high end of the range that was marketed to investors."", 'A criticism of the IPO process is that stocks are priced for the one-day pop Reddit stock experienced, not to find a valuation that garners the most capital for a company. In essence, these events are for bankers, not investors or employees. But, of course, they are.', ""And over the long run, the value of Reddit or any other company will be set by the market and subject to forces that frustrate or confound executives, insiders, employees, and others.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Paychex's  ROE."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Paychex ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Paychex is:', '46% = US$1.6b ÷ US$3.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.46 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""Firstly, we acknowledge that Paychex has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 10% net income growth seen by Paychex over the past five years."", ""Next, on comparing Paychex's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 11% over the last few years."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is PAYX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PAYX is currently mispriced by the market."", ""While Paychex has a three-year median payout ratio of 76% (which means it retains 24% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow."", ""Moreover, Paychex is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 75%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 44%."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Paychex's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad.

The main reason was its very spicy valuation. ', 'Wingstop trades at an extremely high valuation multiple compared to other restaurant stocks:', 'WING PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts', ""As that chart shows, it trades more than 100 times its forward PE ratio and free cash flow.

The company aims to deliver mid-single-digit same-store sales growth over the near term and a low-single-digit rate over the longer term while targeting 10%-plus annual unit growth. While those are solid growth rates for the restaurant industry, they're not unique to Wingstop. "", ""Starbucks launched its triple shot reinvention strategy last year to recharge its growth rate. The leading global coffee chain aims to grow its same-storage sales by 5%-plus over the longer term while growing its revenue by more than 10% annually and delivering 15% annual earnings-per-share growth.

Finally, while Chipotle doesn't provide investors with a long-term growth forecast, it expects to deliver same-store sales growth in the mid-single-digit range this year, which matches Wingstop's 2024 outlook. "", ""I am a very long-term investor and rarely sell on valuation concerns alone. However, I think Wingstop's valuation has run up too high to justify. It's hard to see much more upside potential since the market has already priced the stock to perfection. It would only get more expensive if shares kept rising. The risk/reward profile therefore skews more to the downside. If the market cools off or Wingstop misses expectations, its stock could crater. That's why I decided to ring the register and sell my Wingstop stock after a red-hot run. I might consider investing in the stock again if its valuation comes down to a more reasonable level.

The engineers who made streaming possible were celebrated as much as the people behind the programming strategy that created “House of Cards” and “Stranger Things.”', '“I think the media industry more today than ever before needs two skill sets at the top of the house,” creativity and commercialization, said Mike Speck, a partner at leadership advisory firm Heidrick & Struggles. “Sometimes you find someone who has both—it’s not that often.”', 'There have been some areas of friction. At a meeting for company executives in Los Angeles earlier this month, Peters acknowledged that the two men disagreed over whether to strike a deal for WWE wrestling rights, attendees said. They got on the same page and Netflix reached a $5 billion, 10-year deal.', 'Sarandos has raised questions about some of Peters’s initiatives, including what the long-term plan is for Netflix’s foray into gaming, according to people familiar with the situation, while Peters has questioned Netflix’s spending on certain movies and shows.', 'To help with the transition, Netflix brought in an executive adviser who had given succession-planning advice to business titans including Disney Chief Bob Iger and longtime Estée Lauder leader Leonard Lauder.', '“For this to work out, it wasn’t just about Greg and Ted being experts in their domains, but about building a strong relationship between the two of them,” said Bill Holmes, the former head of business development at Netflix. “That was new to Netflix.”', 'Together, they are starting to put their stamp on Netflix’s culture, with internal discussions under way to re-examine core principles such as employee freedom, given that the company is maturing and facing new business pressures.', 'On investor calls, Peters and Sarandos generally stick to their own expertise, passing the baton between them.', '“So with that, I tag team to my partner, co-CEO,” Peters said on a January call.', 'Through a spokeswoman, Peters and Sarandos declined to be interviewed. Peters told tech site Stratechery in January that while Netflix doesn’t need to have co-CEOs to succeed, it is well-suited for the model. “There’s these two very deep, very important centers of expertise, and we get to have a CEO who’s hopefully, I’ll say with a little bit of humility, good at both of those.”', 'Sarandos, a community college dropout who started out working in a video-rental store, climbed that industry’s ranks before joining Netflix in 2000. As chief content officer, he had the foresight to create the streamer’s original programming strategy, recognizing that it would get harder and more expensive over time to license movies and shows from Hollywood competitors. The 59-year-old is a superfan of stand-up comedy and TV sitcoms, and reveres the late Norman Lear, the writer and producer of 1970s hit TV comedies.', 'Sarandos spends time out of the office schmoozing with Hollywood A-listers, sometimes inviting them to his home, where he has been known to cook pizza in his wood-burning oven. He once vacationed on a private island in French Polynesia with Leonardo DiCaprio and counts stand-up comedians, including Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld, among his friends.', 'Peters, 53 years old, was a member of the Air Force who once had ambitions to be an astronaut and has a degree in physics and astronomy from Yale. He joined Netflix in 2008 from tech company Macrovision Solutions. While Peters enjoys entertainment—the sci-fi classic “Blade Runner” and Netflix series “One Piece” are among his favorites—his interests span broader: He is a seasoned pianist and wine connoisseur.', 'Peters is at home discussing the science behind just about anything. He once got into a debate with Neil Hunt, Netflix’s former head of product, about the weight of a “bit”—a unit of information in computing. At a dinner with colleagues, he asked the waiter to put the wine in a blender because he thought it hadn’t opened enough.', 'Peters is an avid tennis player and health nut who has been known to bring vitamin gels and a thermos of tea to meetings. An intensive competitor, he once turned a bike ride with colleagues in Holland from a casual outing into a race.', 'Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who was CEO for most of Netflix’s existence, told colleagues that Peters and Sarandos each had potential to succeed him and began giving each more responsibility.', 'In 2015, online education company Coursera was courting Peters. To keep him, Hastings made Peters the first general manager of Japan, creating a new structure under which Sarandos’s content staffers in Japan would report to Peters. Sarandos pushed back on the idea, saying the old structure was working fine around the world, according to people familiar with the discussions. Hastings overruled him.', 'A couple of years later, Hastings replaced Hunt as head of product with Peters, a move that shocked Netflix staffers.', 'Hastings also gave Sarandos additional responsibilities, including marketing and communications. Eventually, Hastings promoted him in 2020 to serve as co-CEO, while also giving him oversight of legal and policy. Peters was promoted to chief operating officer at the time.', 'As Sarandos and Peters moved up the ladder, there were constant tensions between their two groups: product and content. At times, Sarandos and his team would want a particular show or movie to be highlighted on the Netflix home screen to appease the creators or actors involved.', 'Netflix had a row on the home screen that highlighted new releases, but it was tailored to each user’s viewing patterns by Netflix’s algorithm. A fan of dramas might see fewer sitcoms in that row, for example.', 'When the comedy “Friends from College” made its debut on Netflix, Fred Savage, who starred in the show, and Nicholas Stoller, one of its creators, complained to Sarandos’s team about not being able to find the show.', 'It was one of several incidents that Sarandos and his team had to manage with talent and would raise with Peters’s team, which resisted overriding the algorithm. Eventually, the two sides compromised by testing out the “Ted Row,” which showed all households the same new releases—no matter what the Netflix bot wanted. Netflix discontinued it after finding that it didn’t improve user engagement.', 'Even before Hastings prepared to step down as CEO and elevate Peters into the role of co-CEO alongside Sarandos, he brought in the executive adviser, Marc Feigen, for succession-planning help.', 'In the setup that was announced in early 2023, content, marketing and legal went to Sarandos, while product, HR, technology, advertising and gaming went to Peters. A few months later, Feigen found that some employees still weren’t clear on lines of communication—which executive they were supposed to update on which topics. Sarandos and Peters quickly addressed the issue.', 'The business results have been strong. Netflix last year increased the number of subscribers about 13% to more than 260 million globally. Netflix’s customer turnover remains low at around 2%, despite the password-sharing crackdown, according to research firm Antenna.', 'The real test of the co-CEO partnership will come if the company hits another rough patch—if growth stalls and pressure to cut costs increases—or if the executives have to spar over which new initiatives should get investment.', 'Tough, candid conversations are crucial to make the co-CEO model work, said Scott Taylor, a professor of organizational behavior at Babson College. “When you see co-CEOs fall apart, it’s often because the nature of the relationship is territorial and there is a lack of clarity around each one’s direction,” Taylor said.', 'Write to Jessica Toonkel at jessica.toonkel@wsj.com', 'How to Get Netflix, Hulu and Other Streaming Services to Recommend Better Shows', 'These Startups Wanted to Be the Next Tesla.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.0%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' View our latest analysis for General Dynamics ', 'We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Based on the last payment, General Dynamics was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 46.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.24 total annually to $5.68. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.8% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Although it's important to note that General Dynamics' earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time. Growth of 1.3% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either."", 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', 'Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 28% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 18% in the last year."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish.

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time."", ""Over half a decade, NextEra Energy managed to grow its earnings per share at 0.3% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months.

This free interactive report on NextEra Energy's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for NextEra Energy the TSR over the last 5 years was 43%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""While the broader market gained around 33% in the last year, NextEra Energy shareholders lost 16% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade.

This wasn't always the situation, noting that the yield was closer to 4% at the end of 2022. The steep unit price decline that pushed the yield higher is worth examining, but the potential fallout from that decline is also worth considering. To get an idea of why the latter consideration is important, just look at what's happening with Equitrans Midstream (NYSE: ETRN) today."", ""NextEra Energy Partners was created by NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), one of the largest utilities in the United States. In addition to being a large regulated utility, NextEra Energy is also one of the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world. To take advantage of Wall Street's once hot demand for anything related to clean energy, NextEra Energy created a master limited partnership (MLP) to own clean energy assets."", 'NextEra Energy Partners is basically a funding vehicle for its parent, NextEra Energy. The parent sells clean energy assets, or ""drops them down,"" in industry lingo, to the MLP. The MLP buys the assets by issuing units and taking on debt. NextEra Energy uses the cash from the asset sales to fund future investments. NextEra Energy Partners uses the cash flow from the assets it buys to pay distributions to unitholders.', ""But investors have soured on the clean energy space, leading to a notable decline in the price of NextEra Energy Partners. That makes it more expensive to sell units. Making matters worse, rising interest rates increased the cost of debt capital, too. At this point, it isn't nearly as attractive for NextEra Energy to sell assets to NextEra Energy Partners. And, as you might expect, NextEra Energy has announced plans to pull back on drop downs. That, in turn, will lead to slower growth at NextEra Energy Partners."", ""The big story for Equitrans Midstream is that EQT Corp. (NYSE: EQT), the company that created the MLP, is buying it back. This isn't the first time that a parent company of an MLP has bought back the MLP it created. The list includes utilities like Dominion Energy\xa0and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, among others."", 'As you might expect, EQT is pitching its purchase of Equitrans Midstream as a positive. In fact it called the transaction ""transformative,"" even though it is, in many ways, just recreating the company as it was before Equitrans Midstream was spun off. The real story is that Equitrans Midstream is being bought back at a price that is far below the price at which it was spun off.', ""Now think back to NextEra Energy Partners. The purpose of that MLP is to be a funding vehicle for NextEra Energy, but it just isn't as valuable as it once was on that front. With the unit price dramatically lower than it was, there's a very real possibility that NextEra Energy simply buys the MLP back on the cheap."", 'To be fair, the runway for growth in the clean energy sector is more attractive than the growth opportunity in the pipeline sector. That suggests that NextEra Energy might want to wait longer to see what happens with NextEra Energy Partners before doing anything rash. But there are multiple examples of MLP spinoffs being bought back once they have outlived their usefulness. If you own NextEra Energy Partners you should keep the Equitrans Midstream situation in the back of your mind.', ""The real concern here, however, should be for investors who are considering adding NextEra Energy Partners to their portfolio because of its hefty 12%+ distribution yield. While that yield is backed, to some degree, by a strong parent, NextEra Energy could just as easily decide to buy the MLP, effectively making what was an attractive yield quickly go away. Equitrans Midstream, among others, shows that this is, in fact, a very real possibility and a risk dividend investors shouldn't ignore."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy Partners wasn’t one of them.

Fortunately, it remains profitable as fiscal Q1 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income rose 24% yearly to $2.7 billion.', ""Looking at the stock performance, it's hard to say whether investors are reacting to its AI potential or lackluster finances in recent quarters. The stock is up 35% over the last year. While impressive, it dramatically underperformed other AI chip stocks such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices."", ""Nonetheless, with a P/E ratio of 24 and a forward P/E ratio of 17, one can argue that Qualcomm is attractively priced, particularly when considering AMD's forward earnings multiple of 50 or Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 37."", ""That valuation could give investors a chance to buy into an AI chip stock at an attractive price. Also, at $165 per share, investors with a $1,000 budget have the opportunity to purchase a few shares before more investors notice Qualcomm's AI capabilities."", ""Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Up 41% year to date, Meta Platforms is nevertheless an under-the-radar AI stock.

However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.', 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ', ""The Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$428 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$446, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.07% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$70m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders."", ""Insiders sold Lockheed Martin shares recently, but they didn't buy any.

It's not as big as some of its rivals in the energy midstream sector. It also doesn't offer quite as high a dividend yield as some of its more popular peers. "", ""However, Williams' 5.1%-yielding dividend is on a super safe foundation. Further, the company has a lot of fuel to grow its payout in the future. That's why income-focused investors won't want to overlook the pipeline stock."", 'Williams produces over $5 billion in cash flow each year. More than 90% of its earnings come from government-regulated rate structures or long-term, fixed-rate contracts. That steady cash flow puts its dividend on a very solid foundation. ', 'The pipeline company produced enough cash to cover its dividend 2.4 times in 2023. That enables the company to retain more than enough money to maintain and expand its natural gas infrastructure operations. It uses the remaining excess free cash to strengthen its balance sheet, giving it the financial flexibility to make acquisitions as opportunities arise. ', ""Williams ended last year with a 3.6 leverage ratio. That was a 1.2 times improvement from its level in 2018. The company's low leverage ratio and stable cash flow support its solid investment-grade credit rating (BBB/Baa2). It primarily has long-term, fixed-rate debt (4.9% weighed average rate with 10.3 years weighed average maturity) with a well-laddered maturity profile. "", ""The company's combination of steady cash flow, high dividend coverage, and low leverage ratio put its dividend on an extremely firm foundation."", ""Williams has a growing list of organic expansion projects under construction that it's funding with retained cash flow. The company has 10 projects to expand its natural gas transmission pipeline system, five high-return infrastructure expansion projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and five gathering expansions across its gathering and processing (G&P) operations. These projects will come online through 2027, giving it lots of visibility into future earnings growth. They help drive the company's view it can grow its adjusted EBITDA by 5% to 7% annually over the long term. "", ""On top of that, the company has more projects under development. It's evaluating 30 additional natural gas transmission development projects and has further expansion potential in the Gulf of Mexico and its G&P operations. In addition, Williams is evolving as the energy sector transitions to lower carbon sources. It's working on solar and battery projects to self-power its operations, developing carbon capture and storage projects, and working on potential hydrogen hubs. "", 'Williams also has the financial flexibility to make acquisitions as opportunities arise. Williams closed its $2 billion acquisition of a major natural gas storage portfolio earlier this year. Meanwhile, Willaims bought MountainWest (a natural gas transmission and storage business) for $1.5 billion last year. It also closed two strategic transactions in the DJ Basin for $1.3 billion, making it the third-largest gatherer in the region. ', ""These growth drivers should give Williams the rising cash flow to continue increasing its dividend. The company boosted its payout by 5.3% last year and 6.1% in early 2024. It's targeting 5% to 7% dividend growth in 2025, which it can achieve while maintaining strong financial metrics. Given its growth backlog and financial flexibility, Williams should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout well beyond 2025. "", ""Williams offers income investors a very durable dividend. It generates very stable cash flow, has a low dividend payout ratio, and a strong balance sheet. That gives it the financial flexibility to pay its attractive dividend while investing to expand its operations, which should fuel dividend growth in the future.

Intel lost market share in the CPU market and missed out on the AI-driven GPU boom. Intel believes it can unlock growth in the foundry business and become the second-largest foundry by 2030.', ""Size isn't the only differencing factor. Supported by government funding, Intel is building foundries across the United States to onshore semiconductor production. This presents an opportunity for American chip makers to reduce the geopolitical risks of relying too much on Taiwan. Granted, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also investing in U.S. fabs."", ""Intel stock was left for dead but now has hope. After last year's run-up, it's understandable why the stock would pull back given that much of its potential growth is years away."", 'Nike is facing two key threats. The first is slowing growth out of China. On its Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings call, Nike revised its full-year revenue guidance to just 1% growth compared to fiscal 2023. Softness out of China, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa was largely responsible for the revision.', 'Nike has always dealt with competition, but it seems to be ramping up in recent years. Lululemon sustained breakneck growth and is now worth nearly 40% as much as Nike. Smaller footwear and apparel brands like On Holding and Hoka have taken the market by storm. Hoka is owned by Deckers Outdoor, which also owns UGG and Teva.', 'Nike is a bigger company, so moving the needle is harder.

Value investors will eventually step in and swoop up shares, but the bulk of Nike's sell-off thus far is justified."", ""Apple's sell-off also makes sense. The growth rate of the stock price has far exceeded profit growth, which has made the stock more expensive."", ""Apple is dealing with slowing growth out of China and decent growth elsewhere. However, optimistic investors hope that Apple has a hidden backlog in the form of customers who have older iPhone models and are overdue for an upgrade. This pent-up demand could help Apple get back on track. But the fact remains that iPhone sales growth slowed dramatically, and Apple's business model still greatly depends on the iPhone. And a recent development demands attention -- the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Apple accusing it of illegally stifling competition and violating antitrust laws to keep customers reliant on their iPhones and less likely to switch to another device."", ""To its credit, Apple's high-margin services segment is thriving and continues to put up record results. Apple also bought back a considerable amount of stock, which has helped its earnings per share (EPS) growth outpace net income growth. The impact of stock buybacks doesn't always appear in the short term. But given the pace at which Apple repurchases shares, you can begin to see the divergence over the medium term."", ""Referring back to the chart, consider that Apple's net income is up 76.5% over the last five years but EPS is up 116% thanks to buybacks. Apple's steadfast buybacks make the stock a better value even when growth is slow."", 'Out of all the companies on this list, Apple stands out as the best long-term investment because parts of the business are doing well, it has a rock-solid balance sheet and plenty of cash to make an acquisition to fuel growth if needed, and it remains a market leader.

But not so. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary, the figure usually likeliest to trash regulators, rivals, politicians, suppliers or anyone else he views as screwing up, is displaying robust support for the troubled manufacturer.', 'For all of his over-the-top rhetoric, O’Leary merits great credibility as the most successful airline chief in Europe. He’s built Ryanair from a tiny challenger to the flag carriers pioneering the never-before-seen category of budget air travel when he took the joystick in 1994 into the region’s largest player, measured by passengers flown. This year, Ryanair expects to transport 183 million people on 1.3 million flights to 235 destinations. That’s aboard around 600 planes, and 95% of them are Boeing. That roster stands in stark contrast to the Airbus-dominated lineups at his rivals Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways. O’Leary’s now the longest-serving CEO of all the world’s major airlines.', 'A major reason O’Leary’s such a fan: He’s the prime customer for the 737-8-200, a higher-density version of the 737-8 that he claims allows Ryanair to carry more people at lower cost per passenger than than its rivals, who primarily fly slightly lower-seat-count Airbus models on similar routes.\xa0 In fact, Boeing developed the 8-200 specifically for Ryanair’s business model. O’Leary labels it “the Gamechanger.”', 'In recent weeks, O’Leary’s been steadfast in stating that Boeing’s en route to solving its safety weaknesses, praising the general quality of its aircraft, leaving no doubt he’ll honor all his orders and in all probability, exercise his options, and showing confidence Calhoun and top management. He’s still pointed, though less brutal than usual, in prescribing what Boeing must do to regain its one-time status as an exemplar of defect-spotting safeguards on the assembly line. In a March 21 release, O’Leary declared that “Boeing continues to have our wholehearted support as they work through these temporary challenges. But there’s no doubt in our mind that on the shop floor the systems and quality control in Seattle need to be improved.” In the meantime, according to reporting in the Wall Street Journal, other heads of big Boeing airline customers are demanding meetings with Boeing board directions—presumably to voice their frustrations sans Calhoun.', 'O’Leary bashes the European pols’ cheerleading over Boeing’s stumbles', 'O’Leary’s reserving his most potent broadsides for the European statesmen crowing on how Boeing’s decline is boosting the fortunes of the European champion, Airbus. At a Berlin conference of European leaders in late March, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire asserted, “I’d rather fly Airbus than Boeing. My family too. They care about me.” From an airline colloquy in Brussels, O’Leary fired back, telling Politico, “Some stupid French politician is going, my family don’t feel safe on a 737. Well, tell him to try flying on an Airbus with a problem with the engine that hasn’t been repaired.” That’s a reference to the defects in Pratt & Whitney engines that have grounded hundreds of Airbus planes across Europe.', 'The Irish firebrand took particular umbrage that a Frenchman would claim he fears for his life aboard a 737 when the aircraft’s been a huge hit with his fellow countrymen, and transporting them safely for years. “This summer, millions of French citizens and visitors will fly from France on Ryanair 737s. We’re based in Marseilles, in Toulouse, in Bordeaux, in Paris at Beauvais, all of which operate the 737,” O’Leary riposted, adding that “We live in a world where we encourage free speech and Donald Trump is talking rubbish and so is Bruno Le Maire.”', ""O'Leary's vision for Ryan Air"", 'In 2009 while reporting a piece on the Irish economy, I interviewed O’Leary at his office, situated in what appeared to be a dumpy, converted hangar at Dublin Airport. He appeared in his charactertic uniform of jeans, an open-necked white shirt, his glasses parked high on his forehead. His office digs looked more appropriate to employee charged with finding lost bags than a CEO. We went downstairs to an employee lounge where O’Leary got a vending-machine espresso bought with a euro bummed from a flight attendant. At ease amidst the bruised plastic furniture and polyester carpeting, O’Leary declared, “We’ll mop the floor with every airline in Europe!” On the wall hung a calendar titled “Girls of Ryanair,” each month’s page displaying a flight attendant posing in a bikini. “They actually do work here!” O’Leary assured me. He was appalled that “woke” critics wanted to nix the displays, which Ryanair sold to raise money for charity. He lost out. “Girls of Ryanair” made its parting appearance in 2013.', 'O’Leary met Tony Ryan, who founded Ryanair in 1984, while working as the future billionaire’s tax accountant. This writer had dinner at a restaurant in Las Vegas with Tony Ryan in 2006, a year before he died, along with a Ryanair director. The quiet, softspoken Ryan appeared the antithesis of his volcanic protégé. That evening, Ryan spoke about the fantastic job O’Leary had done in saving his creation from bankruptcy upon ascending to CEO, and how his confidence in O’Leary allowed him the luxury of indulging his love for breeding racehorses at his multiple equestrian enclaves from the U.S. to France to Ireland, A few days later, I received a photo book in the mail from Ryan depicting these opulent, scenic properties. O’Leary’s lifestyle echoes the rural aristocratic bent of his predecessor. The CEO lives on an 1,000 acre farm, and shares Ryan’s passion, reportedly spending millions of euros a year on purchasing thoroughbreds.', 'Daft-sounding ideas and sayings are O’Leary’s trademark. He once claimed to consider putting coin slots on Ryanair toilet doors in a “pay to pee” initiative. On the frugality of one nation’s air travelers, he opines, “Germans will crawl bollock-naked over broken glass to get low fares!” O’Leary, who rivals Bono for celebrity status in Ireland, thinks he’s more deserving of the honor for which the rock star was famously nominated, but didn’t win. “Screw Bono,” O’Leary once said, “I should get the Nobel Prize.” How does O’Leary get away with zany eruptions that make even “Captain Outrageous” Ted Turner look mild? By delivering big time for shareholders in what’s been a mainly unprofitable industry, and laughing at his own wacky persona. “I’m Irish so I was born with bullshit on tap,” admits O’Leary.”We can’t help ourselves!”', ""O'Leary's critique of Boeing and its management"", 'Still, O’Leary stresses that the setbacks in deliveries will strain Ryanair’s operations, and also prove a burden to customers. He expects that that Boeing will ship only 40 of the 57, 197-seat 737-8-200 “gamechangers” due by the close of 2024. The delays will make Ryanair short by ten planes, or around 2% of last year’s fleet, during the peak summer travel season. As a consequence, Ryanair will reduce frequencies on its existing routes, but won’t discontinue those where it’s recently launched new service. The grounding of what he predicts as around 20% of the competing Airbus fleet resulting from engine problems will further curb capacity across Europe. The aircraft shortages, O’Leary forecasts, will drive Ryanair to lift ticket prices around 10% above what it was charging last summer.', 'Also on offer are recommendations on what type of leaders should be running Boeing, and its recent miscues in emphasizing the wrong roles and maybe miscasting top managers. On the one hand, O’Leary praises Calhoun and CFO Brian West as “a good team who are the right track.” But he’s critical that the plane-maker named a new chief of the 737 program, but assigned oversight of the sector’s safety to another manager. “Why isn’t the person in charge of 737 in charge of safety as well?” he asked in an interview on the Skift site. “Boeing likes to talk corporate bullshit that they have a leadership team of 3,500 people but that’s a committee designing a fucking camel.”', 'Most of all, O’Leary rightly worries that the top airline brass don’t have their hands on the levers and valves that power the factory floor. Asked in the Skift interview what he thought of Stan Deal, head of the commercial airline business, O’Leary said that Deal is “a very good sales guy” but that “what Boeing needs isn’t necessarily a good sales guy. They need someone who’d going to sit there on a daily basis and do the grind. What’s the delay? What’s the problem, and fixing the supply chain.” For O’Leary the systems and quality control on the factory floor need a big improvement, and “Boeing needs leadership, he needs to sit in Seattle on a daily basis and [focus on] producing aircraft. They don’t need sales. They’re fully sold out until 2030 anyway.”', 'Wise words. O’Leary knows Boeing got in the mess by not heeding the warnings and seeking insights from the folks who fasten the bolts and attach the panels on these fabulous flying machines. Boeing needs top management that’s steeped in, and obsessed by, every detail in the production process, not the big picture, profit-driven brass that let Boeing stray from its roots in quality and engineering. And no ones sees that landing field more clearly than Michael O’Leary, Boeing’s disappointed customer, but still true believer.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

(NYSE:TEL). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth of 11% on the NYSE over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at TE Connectivity’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', 'According to our valuation model, TE Connectivity seems to be fairly priced at around 4.1% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy TE Connectivity today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $149.44, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that TE Connectivity’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -18% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for TE Connectivity. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk."", 'Are you a shareholder? Currently, TEL appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TEL for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on TEL should the price fluctuate below its true value.', ""So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing TE Connectivity at this point in time.

Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 16%."", ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Waters ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, Waters achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.1% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 7% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.', 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""This free interactive report on Waters' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""Waters shareholders gained a total return of 16% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 7% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

Some need to raise capital. Others need liquidity for early investors and employees. Others may be spun out from some kind of private ownership structure.', 'For venture-backed companies, the class from which Reddit emerged, avoiding a down round is certainly the goal. Moreover, many companies raised oodles of cash during the pandemic, making the need for more money a problem for tomorrow.

But the issue was well-received — shares priced at the high end of the range that was marketed to investors."", 'A criticism of the IPO process is that stocks are priced for the one-day pop Reddit stock experienced, not to find a valuation that garners the most capital for a company.

If you want to skip our introduction to the Australian stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best ASX Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""With a market capitalization of $1.5 trillion, the Australian stock exchange, also called the ASX, is one of the biggest stock exchanges in the world. It is run and managed by the Sydney, Australia based financial services firm ASX Limited (ASX:ASX.AX), and like other stock exchanges, the ASX's composition along with the most valuable companies listed in Australia is somewhat a reflection of the Australian economy."", ""For instance, the most valuable publicly traded company in Australia is the global mining giant BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP). Its latest market capitalization sits at $141 billion, and the firm's top spot in valuation terms is unsurprising given the crucial role that mining plays in the Australian economy. However, when we move further down the ladder of the most valuable Australian stocks, and particularly those that trade on the ASX, the list becomes a bit more diversified and ends up showcasing the advanced nature of Australia's business sector."", 'To understand this, consider the most valuable ASX stocks after BHP. These are Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX:CBA.AX), CSL Limited (ASX:CSL.AX), National Australia Bank Limited (ASX:NAB.AX), and Westpac Banking Corporation (ASX:WBC.AX). This shows us that the most valuable Australian companies include banks and surprisingly, a biotechnology company. While Australian banking giants, such as the behemoth Macquarie Group Limited (ASX:MQG.AX) are known the world over for their portfolios and services, the country is rarely associated with having a prosperous biotechnology sector - an industry mostly linked with European countries such as Denmark.', 'This top ASX biotechnology stock belongs to CSL Limited, a Melbourne based company with a market capitalization of A$135 and a product lineup covering gene therapies, kidney medicines, and other products. And just like their American counterparts, stocks on the ASX are also sensitive to news about macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates and inflation.', ""In fact, these have created somewhat of a roller coaster picture for ASX stocks. While Australia is a developed country, its proximity to China and vast geographical distance from the rest of the developed Western world means that Australian businesses have to rely on the Asian economic superpower for their fortunes. Additionally, just like other developed nations, Australia has also suffered from the twin troubles of high inflation and worrying GDP growth, particularly when it comes to GDP per capita. For those out of the loop, a nation's GDP per capita measures the economic output per person living inside its borders, and for Australia, the GDP per capita in US dollars has been in a down trend since 2013."", 'The third quarter of 2023 also marked the third consecutive quarterly GDP per capita drop in Australia, a trend that previously surfaced roughly two decades back. Similarly, growth in Australia has also been slowing down, but due to the country being blessed with natural resources, has nevertheless managed to avoid the weak picture painted elsewhere in the developed world. For the full year 2023, the Australian GDP grew by 1.5%, while posting a more modest 0.2% growth in Q4.', ""The relatively modest growth figures which ended up meeting economic estimates have also placed the Royal Bank of Australia (the Australian central bank) at the center of media, investor, and analyst attention. Many believe that further interest rate hikes at a time when Australian consumers are digging into their savings to keep up spending would be unnecessary. On this front, a fresh report from Bloomberg believes that the RBA will continue to hold interest rates at 4.35% since inflation is higher than the bank's preferred range of 2% to 3%."", 'So the next question to ask is how well are Australian stocks doing in a period of tepid economic growth and consumer pain. On this front, the S&P/ASX 200, an index of Australian stocks maintained by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) provides some insight. The index has gained a modest 11% over the past twelve months, and its year-to-date performance (flat) shows that investors are wary about the prospects of China, Australian interest rates, and economic growth. In fact, the S&P/ASX 200 has posted just 7.5% in gains since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving much to be desired particularly when we consider the heavy hitting American stock indexes.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top Australian and ASX stocks to buy.

My long-standing relationship with the telecom giant was one of the many reasons I initially bought its stock."", ""While I recently switched my service to rival AT&T (NYSE: T), I don't plan to swap stocks. I still think Verizon is a better dividend stock, which is why I recently added to my position again."", ""Verizon and AT&T offer attractive dividend yields these days. At first glance, they're pretty comparable. Verizon yields 6.7%, while AT&T's payout is 6.5%. Even though Verizon has a slightly higher yield, that's not what gives it the edge over its peer. The main driver is that Verizon has more financial flexibility, which allows it to steadily increase its dividend."", 'The company most recently raised its dividend by around 2% last September. That was its 17th straight year of dividend growth, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. ', ""While Verizon's payout has been steadily heading higher, AT&T's dividend has gone in the opposite direction. In early 2022, the company slashed its dividend in half following the spinoff of its media division, WarnerMedia, which it merged with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery. The telecom company needed to reset its dividend to reflect its lower post-spin earnings and to retain more cash for debt reduction. "", ""Debt remains an issue for AT&T. While the company's strong free cash flow last year enabled it to reduce its leverage ratio from 3.2 to 3.0, it's well above Verizon's level. Its rival ended 2023 with a 2.6 leverage ratio, down from 2.7 at the end of 2022. Verizon was also able to use its strong and growing post-dividend free cash flow to strengthen its balance sheet. Verizon's lower leverage ratio is why it has a higher credit rating (A-/BBB+/Baa1 versus BBB+/BBB/Baa2 for AT&T). "", ""Verizon and AT&T have similar capital allocation priorities. They're investing heavily to enhance their 5G and broadband networks while paying dividends and strengthening their balance sheets. However, Verizon is further along in its deleveraging, which puts it closer to its goal of eventually returning even more cash to investors. The company expects its capital spending to be in a range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion this year. That's down from $18.3 billion in 2023 and $23.1 billion in 2022. And it's allowing the company to produce more free cash flow to pay a growing dividend and strengthen its balance sheet. "", ""The company's long-term target is to get its leverage ratio down to a range of 1.75 to 2.0. However, it plans to start returning more cash to investors beyond its growing dividend by resuming share repurchases once leverage dips below 2.25. With capital spending coming down and free cash flow rising, Verizon is getting closer to that inflection point. "", ""AT&T is also making progress toward strengthening its balance sheet. Capital spending should decline to a range of $21 billion to $22 billion this year, down from $23.4 billion in 2023. That should enable the company to produce more free cash -- $17 billion to $18 billion in 2024, up from $16.8 billion last year. While that will give it more cash to reduce debt, AT&T has a lot further to go until it reaches Verizon's lower leverage level. It probably won't be in the position to start increasing its dividend anytime soon. "", ""From a customer's standpoint, AT&T is a better option for me. However, from an investor's point of view, Verizon stands out as the better company. It offers a higher-yielding dividend that should continue growing. It also has a stronger balance sheet. The company should supply me with a sustainable and steadily rising income stream, which is something I probably wouldn't get anytime soon if I swapped its stock for AT&T."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

Its latest report included five companies, but one I am most interested in is SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN).', ""For Nvidia to invest in a particular AI player is a big deal, as innovators throughout the industry rely on its sophisticated chips. This means the company likely has more information than the average person on SoundHound's prowess, which investors should note."", ""From the name, it's obvious that SoundHound AI does something with audio and artificial intelligence. Its products are mainly focused on two areas: restaurants and automobiles. But its audio products can easily expand into other areas."", 'One example of a use in the automobile sector is its integration of ChatGPT into Stellantis DS vehicles. This will give drivers a much more powerful digital assistant experience, and 50% of regular drivers say they will utilize it.', ""On the restaurant side, SoundHound recently announced a revamped phone ordering experience with Jersey Mike's Subs. This fully automated experience can take multiple orders at once with extreme accuracy, freeing employees up to do other tasks rather than take orders."", 'This type of automation will only become more prevalent, and a recent study by SoundHound found that 8 of 10 customers believe this kind of order will be the standard in the next few years.', ""SoundHound's product rollout is just in the early stages, and with the heightened awareness of AI capabilities, mass adoption will likely occur soon."", 'But does that make the stock a buy?', 'SoundHound is a relatively small company, posting only $17 million in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2023 (and that was up 80% from the same period the year before). However, it has a massive backlog, with $661 million still in the pipeline for deals already signed. If SoundHound delivers on these deals, it will produce impressive growth, which is likely why Nvidia is investing in it.', ""The problem with cash-burning companies like SoundHound is that it's a race against the clock to become profitable. While the company ended 2023 with almost $100 million in cash, it lost more than $68 million in operations and relied on loans and new equity for its funding. Fortunately, management has been prudent with its cash balance and improving its margins. SoundHound's losses in earnings per share (EPS) improved from $0.15 to $0.07. And given SoundHound's success and massive backlog, it shouldn't have an issue raising additional capital if it needs more liquidity."", ""So far, SoundHound seems like a stock that could be a great investment. But there's still one factor to consider: valuation."", ""Buying the right stock at the wrong price can be disastrous. SoundHound AI was a well-priced stock at the start of the year, but after a strong quarterly report and news of Nvidia's investment, its price exploded."", 'SOUN PS Ratio data by YCharts', ""SoundHound's stock is incredibly expensive around 38 times sales, especially when other AI software stocks trade between 10 and 20 times sales. But if SoundHound can grow its revenue from $17 million per quarter to $100 million per quarter in a few years, today's stock price may not be a bad deal."", 'It all comes down to its future execution, which is impossible to judge right now. So what should investors do?', ""If you're interested in the company and believe it has a strong chance to succeed, taking a small position (no more than 1% of your portfolio) isn't a bad idea. That way, it won't affect your portfolio too much if it fails. But if it succeeds, it will still make a strong return."", ""SoundHound has a great product and a lot of momentum, but that's already priced into the stock. Investing now means you have extreme confidence in SoundHound due to its steep price.

The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.', '""We\'re in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,"" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure\'s (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom. ', ""Udhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:"", ""AI is everywhere and machine learning and AI growth has just exploded. There's lots of theories, lots of views on how AI will manifest itself, how it'll be deployed. But the one thing, the one plain truth is the only way AI can be delivered is through physical data infrastructure on the ground. And what that means is data centers and lots of them. "", ""AI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year. "", ""The AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year. "", 'Brookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REIT Digital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India. ', 'The company invested in three more data center platforms last year:', 'Compass Datacenters: The company partnered with an existing investor to acquire Compass in a $5.5 billion deal. Compass develops mega data center campuses in North America. ', 'Data4: It entered the European data center market by acquiring Data4 for $3.8 billion. The company operates 31 data centers across six European countries. ', 'Cyxtera: Brookfield used its Evoque platform to acquire 40 data center sites out of bankruptcy from Cyxtera. It also purchased the associated real estate of several sites from third-party landlords, including Digital Realty. ', 'Brookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity. ', ""On top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity. "", ""Brookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year. Add the dividend income to its earnings growth rate, and Brookfield could generate total annual returns in the mid-teens, with additional upside as the market starts pricing in Brookfield's AI-powered growth potential. These factors make it a great AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.

The GPU maker dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) era. It's become the third-most-valuable company in the world behind only Microsoft and Apple, and its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, driving even faster growth on the bottom line."", ""Nvidia stock jumped more than 500% since the start of 2023. But with its gains accelerating in the first few months of 2024, a new narrative has emerged around the stock, and with it, some pernicious myths. Some investors now believe the stock is in a bubble that will soon collapse, believing that the stock has run too high, too fast and that its profits aren't sustainable."", 'However, many of the arguments that form that thesis fall apart upon closer examination. Keep reading to see three such talking points that investors should be skeptical of.', ""There's been no shortage of comparisons between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, and many tech CEOs have likened the disruptive potential of AI to the early days of the internet. Of the famous busts from that era, Cisco Systems\xa0sticks out as an analogue for Nvidia. Like Nvidia, Cisco was seen as the picks-and-shovels play of that period, selling routers and switches that were essential for internet connectivity."", ""However, there seem to be more differences than similarities between Nvidia now and Cisco then. Nvidia's competitive advantages are more entrenched than Cisco's were, and it's been building its empire for far longer. Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999 and has been far and away the leader in the category since. It's also built an ecosystem to complement its GPU hardware family, which centers around CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a parallel computing platform it created in 2006 that enables general-purpose computing on Nvidia's GPUs. CUDA essentially functions as a software layer on top of its hardware. While Cisco was just a seller of hardware, Nvidia is selling an entire tech ecosystem."", ""Nvidia is also growing much faster than Cisco ever was during the dot-com boom. In fact, Cisco's earnings per share only increased 140% total from 1996 to 2000, about 25% annually, rising from $0.15 to $0.36 due in part to excessive share-based compensation. Additionally, Cisco's margins actually declined during that period."", ""Nvidia, on the other hand, reported a 588% increase in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share in fiscal 2024, outpacing the stock's gains; its margins exploded, and its share count fell over the year."", ""Overall, Nvidia is a much stronger company than Cisco was during the dot-com boom, and Nvidia stock hasn't gained nearly as much as Cisco did."", ""Another core tenet of the Nvidia bear thesis is that competition will level the playing field in AI. While it's true that AI GPU competition is already arriving in the form of products like Advanced Micro Devices' MI300 and Intel's\xa0Gaudi3, AI components are not a commodity product, and this won't be a race to the bottom."", ""Because of assets like CUDA and libraries of prebuilt code on its Superchips, Nvidia's product line is more than just hardware. Those components effectively lock in vendors and provide a suite of tools for customers that is difficult for competitors to match."", ""While competing products are likely to alleviate the current shortage of GPUs and could weigh on Nvidia's pricing, investors should also remember that the AI market continues to expand and there are new frontiers for Nvidia to penetrate."", ""For example, the company launched an AI PC chip in January, opening up a market that it previously hadn't contested. If Nvidia bears believe AMD and Intel will swipe market share in data center GPUs, which Nvidia currently dominates, they should also consider the prospects of Nvidia turning the tables on its rivals in PCs, their traditional bastion."", 'Meanwhile, the market for edge computing AI chips, meaning in end-user devices, is also up for grabs, giving Nvidia a key growth opportunity there as well.', ""Competition is coming, but Nvidia's competitive moat is formidable, and it can penetrate new AI markets as well."", 'In order for Nvidia stock to be in a bubble, it has to be overvalued. By definition, a bubble means that the price of an asset has risen unsustainably because of momentum rather than fundamentals.', ""Nvidia's fundamentals, on the other hand, look rock-solid. As noted above, the company's GAAP profits jumped by nearly 7 times last year, and Wall Street consistently underestimated the company's growth along the way."", ""Its valuation also doesn't seem irrational. The stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of around 75, and analysts expect earnings per share to nearly double this year, giving it a forward P/E of less than 40. Nvidia could easily top that forecast as well."", ""Based on the company's expected growth rate and its manifest competitive advantages, that valuation seems reasonable. While the stock would certainly fall if it missed estimates, a full-on collapse based on those ratios seems unlikely."", ""There's still a lot of uncertainty in the developing AI market, but there's also huge potential growth even for market leaders like Nvidia."", ""Nvidia stock has been on fire in recent months, and the stock could certainly undergo a significant correction if its results disappoint or the AI revolution doesn't live up to expectations."", ""However, based on its current valuation, the competitive landscape, and the strength of the business, the stock is considerably safer than the naysayers claim, and over the long term, Nvidia's prospects continue to look bright as AI applications proliferate to areas like autonomous vehicles. And Nvidia's chips are likely to play a role in emerging technologies."", ""While it's difficult to predict the short-term movements of any stock, Nvidia still looks like a long-term winner despite claims of an AI stock bubble."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Nvidia sells a physical product (the computing power necessary to support complex AI models) to companies."", ""Amazon's e-commerce arm depends on consumers, but Amazon Web Services is the cloud infrastructure leader and arguably the most valuable part of the business."", 'Meanwhile, Apple and Tesla depend on selling physical products, mainly iPhones for Apple and electric vehicles (EVs) for Tesla. Selling physical products to consumers is the hardest way to monetize AI. Yes, there are exceptions, but this has so far been the case with the AI boom.', ""Tesla doesn't have a clear way to monetize AI in the near term. Its best bets are long-term, fully autonomous driving and robotaxis, but that industry remains unproven."", ""Apple also doesn't have a clear AI roadmap. Sure, Apple will probably integrate AI into its future devices, and the company is doing an excellent job of growing its high-margin services segment. But overall, Apple and Tesla haven't been able to capitalize on AI meaningfully, which may not change anytime soon simply because of the nature of their business models."", ""In fact, analysts are forecasting next-to-no growth for Apple in the short term, which is why its price-to-earnings ratio is nearly the same as its forward P/E. Tesla's forward P/E ratio is lower, implying negative growth."", 'Tesla stock had a lot in common with its other big-tech-focused peers. But the business is totally different.', 'Investors who piled into Tesla all because it was part of the Magnificent Seven have been burned. The sell-off is a good lesson on why chasing a hot trend or assuming a stock will stay correlated when the underlying companies are so different is never a good idea.', ""Tesla's sell-off has been severe not only because it has been left out of the AI theme but also because it is facing growing competition from pure-play EV companies and legacy automakers alike. It has been battling a price war for a while now, with further price cuts expected to fend off slowing demand and low-cost offerings in China, namely from BYD.

But no one can argue that it hasn't become a significant advantage over its competitors today. Microsoft has woven OpenAI's technology right into its various software products. Additionally, the partnership funnels all OpenAI compute needs through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform."", 'OpenAI has expanded beyond its large language model ChatGPT to recently launched video creation engine Sora and humanoid robotics via a joint venture between OpenAI, Nvidia, and Microsoft with start-up robotics company Figure.', ""It's not like Microsoft needs the upside that tying up with OpenAI provides. We're talking about a $3 trillion company with deeper pockets than almost any business on Earth and a better credit rating than the U.S. government. It's also one that generates roughly $70 billion in free cash flow annually, more than most companies accumulate in revenue."", ""Perhaps it's only natural that such a technology juggernaut would happen to partner with the company that turned into arguably the leader in AI innovation today. You have plenty of reasons outside OpenAI to buy and hold Microsoft forever. However, the long-term potential upside of AI and all the ways OpenAI brings Microsoft to that dance are undoubtedly good reasons to believe Microsoft's future is bright."", 'Will Healy (Qualcomm): Qualcomm may have become the forgotten AI chip stock. Most of the focus has fallen to Nvidia, and understandably so, due to its dominant market share.', 'Nonetheless, devices of all kinds will serve as platforms for generative AI, and Qualcomm-supported phones are no exception. The company has just released its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which supports AI models that support as many as 10 billion parameters from one\'s smartphones. The chip\'s capabilities also allow it to create pictures enhanced by AI, engage in ""console-defying"" mobile gaming, or listen to studio-quality audio, all from one\'s device.', ""But Qualcomm doesn't rely exclusively on smartphones. The company has extended its capabilities into the Internet of Things and automotive chips and has begun to develop processors for laptops and tablets. Those products should ultimately expand Qualcomm's AI capabilities."", 'The company is coming out of a slump in the chip industry and an uncertain economy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 24, 2023), revenue of $9.9 billion rose by 5% year over year. This came after a 19% decline in fiscal 2023. Fortunately, it remains profitable as fiscal Q1 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income rose 24% yearly to $2.7 billion.', ""Looking at the stock performance, it's hard to say whether investors are reacting to its AI potential or lackluster finances in recent quarters. The stock is up 35% over the last year. While impressive, it dramatically underperformed other AI chip stocks such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices."", ""Nonetheless, with a P/E ratio of 24 and a forward P/E ratio of 17, one can argue that Qualcomm is attractively priced, particularly when considering AMD's forward earnings multiple of 50 or Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 37."", ""That valuation could give investors a chance to buy into an AI chip stock at an attractive price. Also, at $165 per share, investors with a $1,000 budget have the opportunity to purchase a few shares before more investors notice Qualcomm's AI capabilities."", ""Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Up 41% year to date, Meta Platforms is nevertheless an under-the-radar AI stock. This dichotomy is related to Meta's biggest strength -- it paradoxically combines the traits of a cash cow and a tech start-up."", ""First, consider Meta's cash-cow advertising business. The company generated nearly $135 billion in revenue last year, nearly all of it coming from advertising across its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms. Thanks to Meta's asset-light business model, 35% of that revenue, or $47 billion, was converted into operating profit. That's a fantastic rate, and it helps explain why the company introduced a regular dividend payment for shareholders."", ""Yet, Meta is more than just a profitable tech giant. The company is investing billions of dollars in AI research. In fact, Meta is one of the largest buyers of Nvidia's flagship AI chip, the H100. None other than founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would be running upwards of 350,000 H100s this year to train its AI models."", 'What does Meta need with all that computing power? Well, it has several ambitious goals, such as perfecting its version of the metaverse and developing Artificial General Intelligence.', 'That, in a nutshell, gives Meta investors lots to be excited about, such as the potential for explosive growth -- if the company ever achieves its ambitious AI goals -- combined with a river of cash flow thanks to its legacy social media business.', 'In short, Meta is the type of AI stock investors can buy now and hold for years to come.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While DENTSPLY SIRONA is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level.', ""The next 12 months is set to see EPS grow by 177.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could reach 126%, which probably can't continue without putting some pressure on the balance sheet."", ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.25, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.9% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. DENTSPLY SIRONA's earnings per share has shrunk at 11% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think DENTSPLY SIRONA will make a great income stock.

Coupled with the current 5% dividend yield, this presents a promising opportunity for investors. Here's a look at what makes Devon Energy such an attractive stock for Wall Street and retail investors."", ""The upgrade is interesting because it highlights the improvements in Devon Energy's assets, notably its natural gas assets. This is often overlooked when investors assess the stock. It shouldn't be because Devon has sizable gas reserves, and the collapse in the price of gas is a big reason for the decline in the company's dividend in 2023."", 'The company has a lot of proved developed and undeveloped reserves in gas and natural gas liquids.', 'Resource', 'Proved developed and undeveloped reserves at YE 2023', 'Proved developed and undeveloped reserves (in billions of barrels of oil equivalent*, MMBoe)', 'Oil', '786 million barrels', '786 MMBoe', 'Gas', '3,182 billion cubic feet', '530 MMboe', 'Natural Gas Liquid (MMBbls)', '500 million barrels', '500 MMboe', 'Data source: Devon Energy presentations. *Oil equivalent converts all resources to an equivalent measure based on energy output. 6 thousand cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of oil', ""The chart below demonstrates the significant decline in the price of gas since the start of 2022 (down more than 50% over the period, while the price of oil is up double digits over the same period). The decline played a role in the reduction of Devon Energy's variable dividend. For reference, the company pays a quarterly fixed dividend of $0.22 a share and a variable dividend from the remaining free cash flow (FCF) after the fixed dividend has been paid and share buybacks have occurred."", ""The chart below shows how the decline in FCF per share led to a decline in the dividend. I've also included Devon's outstanding shares to demonstrate that management's buybacks have resulted in a decline in the share count, which is good for ongoing holders as it increases their claim on cash flows."", 'The critical point is that the main reason for the fall in the dividend from 2022 to 2023 (which partly caused the disappointing share price performance) is lower FCF due to lower gas prices. Devon increased its revenue from oil production (despite a 6% decline in the realized price of oil) from the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023.', ""I've focused on Devon's gas operations to lead into why the stock is attractive for investors right now."", ""First, the decline in the price of gas means oil is a more significant part of its overall revenue at present. By my calculations its oil production has gone from 75% of revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to 82% in the fourth quarter of 2023. With the price of oil above $80 a barrel, Devon's prospects look good in 2024."", 'Second, as the Citi analyst intimated, Devon is a good operator of assets and is also good at improving its reserves. As you can see below, its extensions and discoveries have outpaced production over the last five years.', ""Third, on the fourth-quarter earnings presentation, management estimated its FCF yield (at the then share price of around $44) would be 9%, assuming a price of oil per barrel of $75 and 13% at a price of oil per barrel of $85. Interpolating those numbers with today's share price of $48.30 produces an FCF yield of about 10% for a price of oil per barrel of $80. It's a figure that implies Devon can pay an extremely attractive dividend in 2024 while also making share buybacks."", ""All told, investors shouldn't underestimate the impact of falling gas prices on Devon's dividend cut in 2023.

Ever since the dot-com era bust, the company has been downright pedestrian."", 'However, Oracle\'s earnings growth is another story. It\'s further proof that even many decades into their existence, top software companies can show off the merits of an ""infinitely scalable"" business model -- one in which a software product can be built once and sold over and over again to generate incredibly high profit margins.', ""These days, Oracle has been layering cloud infrastructure (or OCI from here on out) into its product suite, made famous in the autumn of 2022 with a first-of-its-kind deal with Nvidia for AI training hardware. A follow-up deal in spring 2023 was struck for OCI first-access to Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI training service."", ""Oracle may not rank as a top cloud-computing stock for many investors, but it's time to change that perception."", 'Oracle CEO Safra Catz explained on the latest earnings call that the company\'s big bets on AI infrastructure continue to haul in lots of new customers. Due to some hardware supply constraints, growth was throttled a bit. Nevertheless, OCI infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), in which AI training hardware housed in a remote data center is ""rented"" by customers, grew 49% year over year to $1.8 billion last quarter.', 'Paired with its older software-as-a-service (SaaS) business -- including sales from the Cerner healthcare software business mega-acquisition in summer 2022 -- total OCI revenue was up 25% year over year to $5.1 billion.', ""On an annualized basis, OCI sales topped $20 billion. That still puts Oracle far behind its larger cloud peers, including Amazon AWS ($97 billion in annualized revenue as of Q4 2023), Microsoft ($104 billion in annualized revenue, which consists of Azure Cloud as well as its legacy cloud-based software), and Alphabet's Google Cloud ($37 billion on an annualized basis). But OCI's infrastructure segment in particular is clearly landing big wins thanks to its Nvidia partnership, as it far outpaces the industry average growth rate."", 'For reference, tech researcher Gartner said IaaS user spending grew at a 20% clip in 2023, and it expects that spending to grow another 26% in 2024.', 'Of course, Oracle is an old business, so Catz and company making progress in OCI is simply offsetting weakness in its legacy software. As a result, total revenue only expanded 7% year over year last quarter.', 'However, and this is important, what Oracle lacks in high-growth rates, it more than makes up for in fantastic earnings performance. Earnings per share grew 16% year over year last quarter as Oracle unlocks higher profit margins from its newer business, squeezes synergies from the big Cerner purchase, and returns excess cash to shareholders via a stock repurchase program ($1.1 billion deployed through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, plus an additional $3.3 billion paid out as dividends).', 'Talk about so-called infinite scalability. This mature tech business can still deliver stellar returns for shareholders long after its heyday. Even when using a less than favorable timeline dated back to Jan. 1, 2000 (not long before the dot-com bubble popped and Oracle and friends got clobbered), the stock has actually been a solid long-term buy-and-hold.', 'As of this writing, Oracle stock trades for 34 times trailing-12-month earnings per share, or just under 30 times free cash flow.

Why?', 'Brian Niccol: The mission that we have is ""Food with Integrity."" And what does that mean? Well, it means clean food. It means food that\'s raised the right way. It means it\'s food that\'s cooked and prepared the right way.', ""[Customers will] talk about how big the portions are with the burritos or the bowls that they build, but when you really boil it down, it is this commitment to Food with Integrity and the [cooking] that actually happens in our restaurants. It's all fresh food done right in front of you, and people are turned on by that, and the fact that we can get it done highly customized and highly fast, it's just meaningful bonus points."", ""Sozzi: It's really just the large portion size, come on."", ""Niccol: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head, Brian. The customization so that you can get the bowl or the burrito the way you want — it is hugely valuable. If you want double meat, we'll do that for you. If you want a little extra rice, we'll do that for you. At the end of the day, however you want to eat, you ultimately feel good about what you're putting in your body. And I think that matters a lot to every generation and every income cohort out there."", ""Sozzi: How is AI and new automation technology going to change Chipotle's future?

That's what I'm most excited about."", 'Sozzi: Is this the year where you test new vision technology in restaurants to improve order accuracy?', ""Niccol: We have not yet, but I'm optimistic that this is the year where we're going to do one or two of these things at least in a restaurant.

Each stock trades at a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple than the S&P 500. Do these discounts to the broader market suggest there is some potential for value investors? Let's dig in and find out."", ""The first company on my list is Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The beverage maker currently trades at a P/E ratio of 24.4, a noticeable discount to the S&P's 28.2."", ""I'll admit that Coca-Cola doesn't exactly deliver screaming growth. But there is a reason that Buffett has held the stock for decades. In addition to its soda, Coca-Cola is also home to water, tea, and coffee brands."", ""This diversified portfolio has helped Coca-Cola expand into new markets and mitigate any losses that may come from changes in consumer preferences or buying trends. As such, Coca-Cola has a long history of steadily growing both sales and profits -- an important pillar of Buffett's investment style."", ""It's this dynamic that has provided Coca-Cola with the financial flexibility to consistently raise its dividend. In fact, the company is part of the esteemed Dividend Kings club -- reserved for businesses that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years."", ""So while Coca-Cola may not be the most exciting opportunity in the market, it's hard to pass up on consistency. Investing in financially sound businesses with a strong brand and consistent dividend has done wonders for Buffett. Given the disparity in earnings multiples compared to the broader market, now could be a unique opportunity to scoop up shares in Coca-Cola stock."", 'The next company on my list is satellite radio provider SiriusXM (NASDAQ: SIRI). Unlike terrestrial radio businesses that tend to rely on advertising, SiriusXM is unique because of its subscription model. With 34 million subscribers, SiriusXM has built both a leading brand and a predictable revenue model.', 'With a P/E multiple of just 12.5, SiriusXM appears seriously undervalued. Moreover, considering Buffett just increased his position by 30 million shares, investors might think now is a good opportunity to buy the stock.', ""But be careful, there's more to the picture here. Since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, churn has been an issue at Sirius. Working from home is more common than it was just a few years ago. Moreover, the macro economy is currently experiencing unusually high inflation and rising borrowing costs. These variables have likely played a role in consumer spending habits -- and SiriusXM has not been immune."", 'Over the last couple of years Sirius has spent significant capital acquiring exclusive rights to podcasts to combat falling engagement -- a strategy that has generated mixed results for competing streaming platform Spotify.', ""While the stock is trading at a steep discount to the broader markets, I think it's warranted. My suspicion is that Buffett's recent buying activity was an attempt to lower his cost basis. While Sirius could turn the ship around, I wouldn't buy the stock right now."", ""The last company on my list is fast-food restaurant McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). Now, if you're pouring over Berkshire's regulatory filings, you won't find any trace of a position in McDonald's. Rather, Buffett owns small position in the conglomerate through a separate portfolio managed by New England Asset Management (NEAM), which is a subsidiary of Berkshire. NEAM is smaller than Berkshire asset size, but it holds far more stocks -- giving investors a broader preview of what other businesses Buffett prefers."", ""I see McDonald's in a similar light as Coca-Cola. The company has a worldwide reach and is a unique business that has the power to grow during different economic cycles. Despite inflation weighing on consumer purchasing power, McDonald's still managed to generate 9% same-store sales growth last year."", ""Moreover, with a dividend yield of 2.4%, McDonald's stock could also be an option for passive income investors. And with a 24.5 P/E, McDonald's is valued comparably to Coca-Cola based on this metric. This could indicate that investors are broadly viewing the food and beverage sector as a lower-conviction growth opportunity compared to the rest of the market."", ""I think now could be a good time to consider McDonald's for your portfolio, and plan to hold for the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 49% over five years, which is below the market return. Meanwhile, the last twelve months saw the share price rise 4.2%."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", "" Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's "", 'While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""During five years of share price growth, McDonald's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.0% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 8% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""We know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, McDonald's' TSR for the last 5 years was 67%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""McDonald's shareholders gained a total return of 6.5% during the year. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 11% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with McDonald's ."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

With a market cap of just $11 billion or so, it is tiny compared to its largest industrial REIT peer Prologis (NYSE: PLD), which has a market cap more than 10 times as large ($120 billion)."", ""But small companies can provide big results, and it looks like that's exactly what Rexford will do thanks to this $200 million-plus secret weapon."", ""As Rexford's name implies, it owns industrial assets like warehouses, distribution facilities, and light manufacturing buildings. But it has a unique focus that sets it apart from peers like Prologis, which owns a globally diversified portfolio. Rexford goes to the other extreme: It owns a geographically concentrated portfolio. All the REIT's properties are located in Southern California."", 'On the surface, that sounds like a fairly risky proposition. And on some levels, it is. However, Southern California is one of the largest industrial markets in the world because of its location near key seaports and is larger than any other industrial market in the United States. Demand for warehouses is very strong there.', ""Now add in some key external factors, and the story gets even better. For example, there is little available land to build new properties in this highly developed region. And there's a higher call for residential development, which has led to industrial land being re-zoned for residential or commerical. So Rexford is operating in a market with very attractive supply/demand characteristics."", 'This is where the rubber hits the road: Rexford believes that it can add $240 million or more to its net operating income (NOI) by 2026. That would represent a huge 42% increase over the fourth-quarter 2023 NOI run rate. The best part is that the foundation for all of that NOI expansion is already in place within the company.', 'For example, management expects to see a $95 million benefit from redeveloping existing properties. Basically, it is taking older assets and modernizing them so the REIT can charge higher rents. Another $95 million or so is set to come from existing leases rolling over to higher rental rates as the old leases end. This is not some fanciful projection -- in the fourth quarter of 2023, Rexford was able to sign new leases with 77% higher rents than the expiring leases.', ""Those will be the two biggest drivers of NOI growth over the next three years, but they aren't the only ones. Another $40 million will come from rental increases that are written into existing lease contracts. And $10 million will come from recent acquisitions."", 'This one, however, is a bit of a wild card, since Rexford is always looking for acquisition opportunities. The $10 million figure is related to what it has already bought, and there could be material upside if the REIT buys more properties.', ""But the big story here isn't the opportunity presented by future acquisitions. Those are impossible to predict. The really attractive part of Rexford's investment thesis is that everything needed to support the NOI growth opportunity highlighted here is already in the portfolio waiting to be exploited."", 'Rexford Industrial is not a high-yield REIT, given that its dividend yield is only around 3.2%. By comparison, the average REIT, using Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) as a proxy, is yielding about 4%.', ""But what Rexford lacks in yield, it makes up for with dividend growth. Over the past five years, it has increased its dividend at an annualized rate of 22%! That's an incredible figure for any company, let alone a REIT.

It is the most valuable company in the world. Microsoft only yields 0.7%, but it pays the most dividends of any U.S.-based company.', ""Microsoft's low yield is due to its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to dividend raises. Since fiscal 2019, Microsoft has raised its dividend by 9% to 11% every year like clockwork. The dividend has doubled over the last eight years -- a faster growth rate than many of the market's top dividend stocks."", 'Microsoft is monetizing artificial intelligence and growing its earnings, paving the way for plenty of future dividend raises. If the stock price languishes, the dividend yield will rise to a much more attractive level. However, Microsoft shareholders would surely prefer outsized gains over a higher dividend yield.', 'Coke uses its dividend as the primary way to reward faithful shareholders. With a yield of 3.2%, Coke allows investors to collect passive income from a tried and true Dividend King with 62 consecutive annual dividend increases.', ""Coke is a low-growth business, so investors shouldn't expect outsized gains from the stock. But this is the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks, not growth stocks.

The 10-year gives investors another percentage point or so in yield, but with no participation in the market. Of course, no stock is as safe as the risk-free rate, but Coke is close. It's the ideal investment for risk-averse investors or anyone looking to supplement income in retirement."", 'Procter & Gamble has a massive capital return program.

The oil giant tends to buy back more stock during an uptick in the business cycle and pull back on repurchases and capital spending when oil and gas prices fall."", ""But Chevron's dividends are as consistent as they come. Chevron has raised its dividend for 37 consecutive years. That means it didn't cut it during the COVID-19-induced crash, the 2014 and 2015 downturn, or any oil and gas downturn since the late 1980s."", 'Chevron has the balance sheet, cost profile, and portfolio to continue rewarding shareholders. Its dividend yield of 4.2% makes it one of the higher-yielding reliable stocks out there.', 'Home Depot has been a perfect dividend stock over the last decade. It has crushed the broader market, and somehow, the dividend has grown at an ever faster rate.', 'Home Depot has also reduced its share count by over a fourth while expanding the business.', ""Investors shouldn't expect this level of growth over the next 10 years, but Home Depot is still a good investment. The company is vulnerable to external factors, such as broader economic cycles, the housing market, the construction industry, and consumer spending. But it is well positioned, and one of the best cyclical dividend stocks to own long term."", 'Since Nov. 1, JPMorgan is up over 38% -- a massive move for such a large, diversified bank. JPMorgan is now worth more than Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and half of Citigroup combined. The Big Four banks have really turned into JPMorgan and the other three.', ""Banking is a cyclical industry that tends to ebb and flow to the tune of the broader economy. Right now, JPMorgan's profits are soaring."", 'Still, what makes the company a good long-term investment, and a worthy addition to the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks, is that it regularly returns value to its shareholders. Over the last decade, the dividend is up 176%, while the share count is down nearly a fourth.', 'JPMorgan slashed most of its dividend in 2009 during the fallout of the financial crisis. But since then, it has raised its dividend every year.

Today, UPS yields 4.3%, which is high for an industry-leading industrial company.', 'UPS is a cyclical business that depends on the strength of the broader economy.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.2%, which is below the industry average."", ' Check out our latest analysis for American Express ', ""While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, American Express' earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 50.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 16% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.80 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. American Express has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 7.6% per annum.

On comparing with the average industry ROE of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Yet, Mondelez International has posted measly growth of 3.7% over the past five years. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""We then compared Mondelez International's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

The beverage maker currently trades at a P/E ratio of 24.4, a noticeable discount to the S&P's 28.2."", ""I'll admit that Coca-Cola doesn't exactly deliver screaming growth. But there is a reason that Buffett has held the stock for decades. In addition to its soda, Coca-Cola is also home to water, tea, and coffee brands."", ""This diversified portfolio has helped Coca-Cola expand into new markets and mitigate any losses that may come from changes in consumer preferences or buying trends. As such, Coca-Cola has a long history of steadily growing both sales and profits -- an important pillar of Buffett's investment style."", ""It's this dynamic that has provided Coca-Cola with the financial flexibility to consistently raise its dividend. In fact, the company is part of the esteemed Dividend Kings club -- reserved for businesses that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years."", ""So while Coca-Cola may not be the most exciting opportunity in the market, it's hard to pass up on consistency. Investing in financially sound businesses with a strong brand and consistent dividend has done wonders for Buffett. Given the disparity in earnings multiples compared to the broader market, now could be a unique opportunity to scoop up shares in Coca-Cola stock."", 'The next company on my list is satellite radio provider SiriusXM (NASDAQ: SIRI). Unlike terrestrial radio businesses that tend to rely on advertising, SiriusXM is unique because of its subscription model. With 34 million subscribers, SiriusXM has built both a leading brand and a predictable revenue model.', 'With a P/E multiple of just 12.5, SiriusXM appears seriously undervalued. Moreover, considering Buffett just increased his position by 30 million shares, investors might think now is a good opportunity to buy the stock.', ""But be careful, there's more to the picture here. Since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, churn has been an issue at Sirius. Working from home is more common than it was just a few years ago. Moreover, the macro economy is currently experiencing unusually high inflation and rising borrowing costs. These variables have likely played a role in consumer spending habits -- and SiriusXM has not been immune."", 'Over the last couple of years Sirius has spent significant capital acquiring exclusive rights to podcasts to combat falling engagement -- a strategy that has generated mixed results for competing streaming platform Spotify.', ""While the stock is trading at a steep discount to the broader markets, I think it's warranted. My suspicion is that Buffett's recent buying activity was an attempt to lower his cost basis. While Sirius could turn the ship around, I wouldn't buy the stock right now."", ""The last company on my list is fast-food restaurant McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). Now, if you're pouring over Berkshire's regulatory filings, you won't find any trace of a position in McDonald's. Rather, Buffett owns small position in the conglomerate through a separate portfolio managed by New England Asset Management (NEAM), which is a subsidiary of Berkshire. NEAM is smaller than Berkshire asset size, but it holds far more stocks -- giving investors a broader preview of what other businesses Buffett prefers."", ""I see McDonald's in a similar light as Coca-Cola. The company has a worldwide reach and is a unique business that has the power to grow during different economic cycles. Despite inflation weighing on consumer purchasing power, McDonald's still managed to generate 9% same-store sales growth last year."", ""Moreover, with a dividend yield of 2.4%, McDonald's stock could also be an option for passive income investors. And with a 24.5 P/E, McDonald's is valued comparably to Coca-Cola based on this metric. This could indicate that investors are broadly viewing the food and beverage sector as a lower-conviction growth opportunity compared to the rest of the market."", ""I think now could be a good time to consider McDonald's for your portfolio, and plan to hold for the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Investors looking for passive income may be turning to stocks with higher yields and track records of dividend raises."", 'Walmart (NYSE: WMT), WM (NYSE: WM) (formerly known as Waste Management), and Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) consistently buy back shares and raise their dividends. But they now yield less than the S&P 500.', ""Here's why these three dividend stocks are too successful for their own good, and why great companies can become poor sources of income over time."", 'Walmart is hovering around an all-time high. After a successful 3-for-1 stock split, Walmart raised its dividend by 9%, marking the largest raise in over a decade and the 51st consecutive dividend raise. Still, Walmart only pays an $0.83-per-share quarterly dividend, which is a mere 1.3% yield.', ""Prior to this, Walmart had made close to bare minimum annual raises. But that's mostly because it has been reinvesting in its stores and improving the underlying business. The strategy has mostly worked."", ""Walmart's revenue is up over 25% in the last five years -- a fairly big move for a company its size. Its operating margin is back over 4%, which makes a big difference for its profitability."", ""However, Walmart's trailing-12-month net income is surprisingly lower today than it was a decade ago because Walmart has increased its capital expenditures (capex). In fact, capex has nearly doubled in just three years!"", ""If Walmart wasn't spending so much on capex, it would be generating record profits. But long-term investors care more about where a company's profits are years from now than what they are today."", 'Aside from store expansions, Walmart has invested heavily in store pickup and delivery through its Walmart+ program. In fiscal 2024, Walmart passed $100 billion in global e-commerce sales for the first time, meaning e-commerce made up over 15% of total sales.', ""Walmart is investing in supply chain automation and remodeling 928 stores and Sam's Clubs over the next year. These improvements have come at a steep cost, which makes Walmart look expensive. But if they work out, they could set the stage for plenty of growth and dividend raises in the future."", 'WM handles the entire waste management value chain, from collection to transportation, separation, treatment, and reuse. The business is pretty self-explanatory, until recently when the reuse side of the equation has expanded far beyond recycling.', ""Similar to Walmart, WM's capex has exploded in recent years, doubling over the last three years. The company's capex growth rate has far exceeded its net income growth rate, which makes sense given WM won't see a return on some of these investments for years."", ""The big driver of WM's investments is sustainability through recycling projects and renewable natural gas (RNG)."", 'Landfill gas (LFG) is produced when bacteria break down organic waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, LFG contains about 50% methane and 50% carbon dioxide -- not a good combination when released directly into the atmosphere. WM is working on trapping and processing that LFG into pipeline quality gas that can be reused. The sustainable process is why the finished product is called ""renewable"" natural gas.', 'RNG production is far more expensive than fossil-based gas. But there are credits to make RNG a good investment. On its Q4 2023 earnings call, WM discussed the stability of the credit program and why credits can be stacked together to make the program more profitable. WM is a leader in the LFG to RNG industry, which has decades of potential especially as the pace of the energy transition accelerates.', 'WM is putting up excellent numbers despite these long-term investments. Profits are near an all-time high and margins have recovered from the pandemic-induced slowdown. WM stock has rather quietly surged over 108% in the last five years, outperforming the S&P 500. The company has made meaningful raises to its dividend, and returned $2.44 billion to shareholders in 2023, but the yield is low because the stock has done so well and WM is investing in long-term growth, not just the dividend.', ""Over the last decade, Sherwin-Williams has increased its dividend by nearly fourfold, WM's has doubled, and Walmart's is up less than 30%. However, Walmart has reduced its share count by more than WM or Sherwin-Williams."", 'Sherwin-Williams is also the best performing of the three, crushing the S&P 500 over the last five years. Pretty good for a paint company in what has been a growth-stock-fueled rally in the broader market.', 'Sherwin-Williams has achieved breakneck revenue growth while keeping its margins fairly high. The key has been margin growth across its business units, especially its largest segment, the paint stores group (PSG). PSG -- which used to be called ""the Americas group"" -- centers around Sherwin-Williams stores that cater to industrial, commercial, and residential customers.', ""The consumer brands group contains products not under the Sherwin-Williams name, like Cabot, Valspar, and others. The segment boomed during the height of the pandemic as folks undertook DIY projects. The segment's sales and profits fell in the most recent quarter, but they are still up substantially from a few years ago, which illustrates how the company has been able to grow despite difficult comps."", 'The performance coatings group is the segment you may be least familiar with since it targets industrial and commercial customers. Sherwin-Williams makes coatings for everything from ships to machinery and equipment, you name it.', ""Sherwin-Williams' dividend is up 90% in the last five years, but because the stock has outpaced this growth, the yield has fallen."", 'Walmart, WM, and Sherwin-Williams are excellent examples of how an investment thesis can change for good reasons.', 'All three companies have grown nicely, put up solid returns for investors, and still have sizable capital return programs with dividends and buybacks. But because the focus is more on growth, these stocks are no longer suitable passive income plays.', ""That doesn't mean that they aren't good investments, but it does mean investors must realign their expectations based on the new direction."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

Here's why each stock could be worth buying now."", 'Daniel Foelber (Nike): Nike is down over 45% from its all-time high and has lost value over the last three years. The stock sold off immediately following its latest earnings report, but there were signs of improvement in the business.', 'On its second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call in December, Nike said it expected negative revenue in Q3 due to difficult comps. It then forecasted low single-digit revenue growth in Q4 -- and ultimately -- just 1% higher revenue in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.', ""Nike reported Q3 earnings on March 21, and they came in higher than expected as revenue was up slightly compared to the same quarter last year. It wasn't a lot to cheer about, but it was a much-needed step in the right direction for patient Nike investors."", ""The company's performance in China remains strained, and competition is fierce from the usual suspects plus newer rival brands like Lululemon, On Holding, and Deckers Outdoor-owned Hoka."", ""Nike's business can fluctuate based on consumer spending. However, the company consistently returns capital to shareholders through dividend raises and buybacks."", ""In the recent quarter, Nike returned $562 million to shareholders through dividends -- 6% more than the same period last year. It also bought back $866 million in stock. In total, it has repurchased around $8 billion of its four-year, $18 billion program, which was approved by Nike's board in June 2022."", ""With a 1.4% dividend yield, Nike may not stand out as the most attractive dividend stock. But its dividend has more than tripled over the last decade, and the outstanding share count is down over 13%. Based on Nike's repurchasing program, we can expect the pace of buybacks to accelerate."", ""At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 30, Nike isn't a bad value for such a powerful brand. But some folks may want to add it to a watchlist instead of buying as to give the turnaround more time to play out."", ""Lee Samaha (Whirlpool): There's no way to sugarcoat this. Relatively high interest rates negatively impact the housing market, which means weak demand for household appliances from the discretionary and new-housing markets. That's not good news for Whirlpool.

Then again, this will likely prove a trough year for the company. Meanwhile, management is restructuring the business for growth."", 'The upcoming divestment of its low-margin European business to a Turkish company will focus Whirlpool on its key, and most profitable, markets like North America, Latin America, and India. In addition, after stripping out $800 million in costs in 2023, management plans to strip a further $300 million to $400 million in 2024.', ""Wall Street expects Whirlpool to deliver $13.51 in earnings per share in 2024, which is more than enough to fund a dividend of $7 per share while investors wait for a lower interest rate environment to boost Whirlpool's top-line prospects. As such, if you are bullish on the long-term prospects of the U.S. housing market, then Whirlpool is an excellent place to invest in the theme."", ""Scott Levine (Brookfield Renewable): Whether you're years away from retirement or your days of punching the time clock are behind you, generating passive income is always a smart investment strategy, regardless of your age.

Because these power-purchase agreements have terms that last for many years -- about 90% of its contracts average 13 years -- Brookfield Renewable has clear insight into future cash flows. Management, consequently, is able to strategically allocate capital, advancing projects in its pipeline to ensure growth and distributing cash to shareholders in a financially prudent manner. While the company is targeting annual-dividend increases of 5% to 9%, it simultaneously expects 10% annual growth in its funds from operation (FFO) from 2023 through 2028."", ""Experienced investors know that sometimes companies will be quick to offer unrealistic outlooks to suit potential investors or reassure current shareholders, so they may be skeptical of Brookfield Renewable's targets.

To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Gold Stocks To Invest In.', 'The close of 2023 saw a surge in gold prices driven by the widespread belief that the precious metal serves as a hedge against inflation, prompting investors to seek refuge amid economic uncertainty. That same year, gold prices experienced a notable surge of over 13%, coinciding with a 3% increase in demand for the yellow metal compared to the previous year, reaching 4,899 metric tons. This data, sourced from the World Gold Council, encompasses purchases made by central banks as well as demand from various sectors including industries, jewelry makers, and investors. The SVB crash and conflicts in the Middle East have further heightened demand for the precious metal throughout the year, consequently leading gold stocks to achieve significant gains. According to a Bloomberg report from earlier in 2023, data from Invesco indicated a notable trend of global sovereign wealth funds and investors increasing their gold holdings. The insights from the report were based on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, managing assets totaling approximately $21 trillion.', 'Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the price of gold also recorded strong performances.

Many\xa0analysts describe the investment environment supporting gold\'s recent performance as a Goldilocks scenario, characterized by ""just right"" conditions.

Their leverage to gold justifies outperformance. For any given move in the price of gold, operating cash flow generated by these companies increases (or decreases) by a much greater percentage.

The GPU maker dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) era. It's become the third-most-valuable company in the world behind only Microsoft and Apple, and its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, driving even faster growth on the bottom line."", ""Nvidia stock jumped more than 500% since the start of 2023. But with its gains accelerating in the first few months of 2024, a new narrative has emerged around the stock, and with it, some pernicious myths. Some investors now believe the stock is in a bubble that will soon collapse, believing that the stock has run too high, too fast and that its profits aren't sustainable."", 'However, many of the arguments that form that thesis fall apart upon closer examination. Keep reading to see three such talking points that investors should be skeptical of.', ""There's been no shortage of comparisons between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, and many tech CEOs have likened the disruptive potential of AI to the early days of the internet. Of the famous busts from that era, Cisco Systems\xa0sticks out as an analogue for Nvidia. Like Nvidia, Cisco was seen as the picks-and-shovels play of that period, selling routers and switches that were essential for internet connectivity."", ""However, there seem to be more differences than similarities between Nvidia now and Cisco then. Nvidia's competitive advantages are more entrenched than Cisco's were, and it's been building its empire for far longer. Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999 and has been far and away the leader in the category since. It's also built an ecosystem to complement its GPU hardware family, which centers around CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a parallel computing platform it created in 2006 that enables general-purpose computing on Nvidia's GPUs. CUDA essentially functions as a software layer on top of its hardware. While Cisco was just a seller of hardware, Nvidia is selling an entire tech ecosystem."", ""Nvidia is also growing much faster than Cisco ever was during the dot-com boom. In fact, Cisco's earnings per share only increased 140% total from 1996 to 2000, about 25% annually, rising from $0.15 to $0.36 due in part to excessive share-based compensation. Additionally, Cisco's margins actually declined during that period."", ""Nvidia, on the other hand, reported a 588% increase in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share in fiscal 2024, outpacing the stock's gains; its margins exploded, and its share count fell over the year."", ""Overall, Nvidia is a much stronger company than Cisco was during the dot-com boom, and Nvidia stock hasn't gained nearly as much as Cisco did."", ""Another core tenet of the Nvidia bear thesis is that competition will level the playing field in AI. While it's true that AI GPU competition is already arriving in the form of products like Advanced Micro Devices' MI300 and Intel's\xa0Gaudi3, AI components are not a commodity product, and this won't be a race to the bottom."", ""Because of assets like CUDA and libraries of prebuilt code on its Superchips, Nvidia's product line is more than just hardware. Those components effectively lock in vendors and provide a suite of tools for customers that is difficult for competitors to match."", ""While competing products are likely to alleviate the current shortage of GPUs and could weigh on Nvidia's pricing, investors should also remember that the AI market continues to expand and there are new frontiers for Nvidia to penetrate."", ""For example, the company launched an AI PC chip in January, opening up a market that it previously hadn't contested. If Nvidia bears believe AMD and Intel will swipe market share in data center GPUs, which Nvidia currently dominates, they should also consider the prospects of Nvidia turning the tables on its rivals in PCs, their traditional bastion."", 'Meanwhile, the market for edge computing AI chips, meaning in end-user devices, is also up for grabs, giving Nvidia a key growth opportunity there as well.', ""Competition is coming, but Nvidia's competitive moat is formidable, and it can penetrate new AI markets as well."", 'In order for Nvidia stock to be in a bubble, it has to be overvalued. By definition, a bubble means that the price of an asset has risen unsustainably because of momentum rather than fundamentals.', ""Nvidia's fundamentals, on the other hand, look rock-solid. As noted above, the company's GAAP profits jumped by nearly 7 times last year, and Wall Street consistently underestimated the company's growth along the way."", ""Its valuation also doesn't seem irrational. The stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of around 75, and analysts expect earnings per share to nearly double this year, giving it a forward P/E of less than 40. Nvidia could easily top that forecast as well."", ""Based on the company's expected growth rate and its manifest competitive advantages, that valuation seems reasonable. While the stock would certainly fall if it missed estimates, a full-on collapse based on those ratios seems unlikely."", ""There's still a lot of uncertainty in the developing AI market, but there's also huge potential growth even for market leaders like Nvidia."", ""Nvidia stock has been on fire in recent months, and the stock could certainly undergo a significant correction if its results disappoint or the AI revolution doesn't live up to expectations."", ""However, based on its current valuation, the competitive landscape, and the strength of the business, the stock is considerably safer than the naysayers claim, and over the long term, Nvidia's prospects continue to look bright as AI applications proliferate to areas like autonomous vehicles. And Nvidia's chips are likely to play a role in emerging technologies."", ""While it's difficult to predict the short-term movements of any stock, Nvidia still looks like a long-term winner despite claims of an AI stock bubble."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

After adding one-trillion dollars of market cap in less than two months, it's clear that investors cannot get enough of Nvidia stock."", ""Ark Invest CEO and outspoken technology investor Cathie Wood penned a shareholder letter earlier this month outlining why she sees some turbulence ahead for Nvidia. Let's break down Wood's argument and assess the warning signs she's posing."", ""In her shareholder letter, Wood makes an apt comparison between Nvidia and Cisco. During the early days of the internet in the 1990s, Cisco enjoyed an extended moment in the spotlight thanks to the company's breakthroughs in routers and computer hardware equipment."", ""Unsurprisingly, investors poured into Cisco stock, eventually propelling Cisco to the world's most-valuable company. Today, Cisco isn't even in the top-50 most-valuable companies measured by market cap."", ""On the surface, I understand the comparison Wood makes. Demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is abnormally high thanks to urgency-driven investments surrounding the AI narrative."", ""Wood warns that rising competition could spell trouble for Nvidia, and it could be here sooner than later. While this may be true, I'm not completely sold on this argument. Understanding the underlying details around increased competition is important for investors to explore."", ""In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, Cisco failed to innovate at the same pace as its competition. As a result, computing hardware became a commoditized product, putting Cisco in somewhat of an existential crisis. While Cisco still operates a successful business, it's clear the company ultimately dropped out of favor with investors."", ""I see things much differently with Nvidia. For starters, designing semiconductor chips and high-performance compute is much more sophisticated than producing routers. In other words, while Cisco's hardware was innovative in the early days of the internet, it didn't take long for competing products to emerge."", ""Nvidia absolutely has competition -- namely, from chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm. Moreover, tangential competition is quickly entering the scene from the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and even Tesla. While I agree with Wood that intensified competition could impact demand for Nvidia's chips, I don't think she's giving the company enough credit."", 'Investors should realize that unlike Cisco, Nvidia has optionality. The company is diversifying its model outside of semiconductors and is building an end-to-end AI platform.', ""Although the chip arena has a rising number of entrants, Nvidia still holds a competitive advantage. The company is a pioneer in the GPU space, providing Nvidia with an enviable first-mover position. While it's plausible that Nvidia could lose some of its pricing power and market share over time, I don't see the competition as too much of a threat."", 'Moreover, with a whopping $26 billion of cash on the balance sheet, Nvidia has been aggressively investing in all sorts of areas across the AI spectrum in an effort to expand beyond chips. Two high-profile applications that Nvidia is exploring include humanoid robotics and enterprise software.', ""Nvidia recently joined OpenAI, Microsoft, and Intel in a $675 million funding round for robotics start-up Figure AI. On top of that, the company is currently an investor in Databricks -- the world's most-valuable privately held software business. I see both of these partnerships as ways for Nvidia to bolster its under-the-radar software operation -- which is already a one-billion-dollar revenue run rate business."", ""Could Nvidia end up as the next Cisco? Of course, anything is possible. I think what's more likely is that if Nvidia's bets in robotics and software don't pan out, then the company could begin to experience decelerating growth. A situation like that could absolutely cause some panic-induced selling from investors."", ""But in my opinion, I don't see that happening. I am encouraged and impressed by all of the moves Nvidia is making outside of chips.
