We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Xylem's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Xylem How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xylem is:10% = US$355m ÷ US$3.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.10 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Xylem's Earnings Growth And 10% ROEAt first glance, Xylem seems to have a decent ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 13% does temper our expectations. Moreover, Xylem's net income shrunk at a rate of 3.2%over the past five years. Not to forget, the company does have a high ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. Hence there might be some other aspects that are causing earnings to shrink. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Xylem's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 7.5% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Xylem's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Xylem Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a high three-year median payout ratio of 51% (implying that 49% of the profits are retained), most of Xylem's profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent.In addition, Xylem has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 36% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 17% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Xylem's performance. Specifically, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a respectable rate of return. Investors may have benefitted, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

But recently, Looney has done an about-face.Most Read from BloombergMortgage Lenders Are Selling Homebuyers a LieHolding Cash Will Be a Winning Strategy in 2023, Investors SayForget Peak Oil Demand: A Thirst for Barrels Puts $100 in ViewChina’s Cautious Growth Target Limits Help to World EconomyWorld’s Riskiest Markets Stumble Into Crisis With Dollars ScarceAfter announcing ambitious plans to cut emissions, BP, one of the world’s top crude producers, is now plowing more money into fossil fuels. Oil consumption is heading for a record this year, according to the International Energy Agency, which advises major economies. Supply — buffeted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a slowdown in US shale growth and lackluster investment in production — can’t keep up.It all comes down to China: The world’s second-biggest oil consumer is snapping up crude after reversing its strict Covid-19 policies. Against a backdrop of tight supply, the demand boost has everyone from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to trading powerhouse Vitol Group predicting a rally to $100 a barrel later this year.“The demand from China is very strong,” Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco — the world’s biggest oil company — said in a March 1 interview in Riyadh.By the second half of the year, analysts say, the market will face a shortage — a scenario that will loom over the industry leaders meeting this week in Houston for CERAWeek by S&amp;P Global, a major annual energy conference.The impending crunch shows that even as the world embraces cleaner sources of energy, the thirst for oil is hard to slake. While the supply pinch has been a boon for crude producers and their investors, it’s hammering consumers and complicating central banks’ efforts to tame inflation.Story continues“My view, short hand, is maybe people are underestimating demand and overestimating US production,” Saad Rahim, chief economist at trader Trafigura Group, said on the sidelines of the International Energy Week conference in London last week.In the wake of its abrupt reversal of Covid Zero — the policy requiring mass lockdowns, travel quarantines and testing and tracing — China’s economy is resurgent, boosting oil demand. Manufacturing posted its biggest improvement in more than a decade last month, services activity is climbing and the housing market is stabilizing.The reopening means Chinese oil consumption is poised to hit a record this year. Daily demand will reach an all-time high of 16 million barrels a day after contracting in 2022, according to the median estimate of 11 China-focused consultants surveyed by Bloomberg News earlier this year.It’s not just China. India and other countries across the Asia-Pacific region are consuming more oil as borders reopen, helping propel global demand to a record 101.9 million barrels a day this year and potentially plunging the market into a deficit by the second half, according to the IEA. Air traffic is recovering, boosting jet-fuel use. And the appetite for crude in the US and Europe has also rebounded.The revival of international travel with China’s reemergence will be one of the “engines that will drive demand going forward,” Christopher Bake, a member of Vitol’s executive committee, said at the International Energy Week conference. “I think we’ll see that progress over the next few months.”Supply is no match for the uptick in demand. Though Russia’s oil exports by sea remained resilient last month, market watchers are looking for signs of disruption after the European Union and the majority of Group of Seven nations banned waterborne imports of oil and fuel following the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s shipments are under threat as India, a top buyer, faces mounting pressure from bankers to show that its cargoes comply with the $60-a-barrel price cap imposed by the G7.OPEC, meanwhile, isn’t budging from the production targets it set back in October. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has said the targets will remain unchanged for the rest of the year.And the US isn’t coming to the rescue. Output from shale basins is growing at a slower pace as producers run out of prime areas to drill. US production tumbled at the start of the pandemic and is still about 800,000 barrels a day below the record 13.1 million reached in early 2020. This year, growth is likely to be around 560,000 barrels a day, according to research firm Enverus.The deceleration comes even as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and their peers pump more oil from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg Television March 1 that global spare production capacity is tight and US shale supply growth is unlikely to make up the shortfall if demand picks up later this year, leaving OPEC as the world’s swing producer.“As we get into the second half of this year the risks to the upside begin to accumulate,” Wirth said.Potential headwinds for oil demand are lurking, however. Fears of a global recession are lingering as central banks tighten monetary policy in their quest to tackle inflation. Though Natasha Kaneva, JPMorgan’s global head of commodities research and strategy, is bullish on China’s crude consumption, she predicts the increase in prices could be a “very slow grind.”In late February, some Wall Street analysts tempered their predictions of a price spike this year. Morgan Stanley cut its forecasts for the second half and softened its view that Brent crude will surge past $100 a barrel, while Bank of America Corp. says it sees less risk of a price jump due to the strength of oil flows from Russia. Brent, the global benchmark, traded near $85 a barrel on Friday.Even so, analysts see crude prices advancing in the second half of the year, with many predicting a return to triple-digit levels for Brent for the first time since August. China’s reopening will strain global spare production capacity, sending prices to $100 a barrel in the fourth quarter as inventories decline and money supply stabilizes, Jeff Currie, Goldman’s head of commodities research, said in a Bloomberg Television interview March 1.“As China comes back, we’re going to lose that spare capacity,” Currie said. “My confidence that we’ll see another price spike in the next 12-18 months is quite high.”--With assistance from Alix Steel, Archie Hunter, Julia Fanzeres, Fahad Abuljadayel, Francine Lacqua, David Wethe and Kevin Crowley.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out—Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsHow Countries Leading on Early Years of Child Care Get It RightMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision Deal©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) - AP Photo/J. Scott ApplewhiteIt would be the biggest new oil field in decades. It could supply as much as 2pc of all the oil needed by the United States. And it would be large enough by itself to make a significant difference to the global price, dealing yet another blow to Vladimir Putin’s collapsing war machine in Ukraine.Over the next couple of weeks, President Joe Biden is expected to approve the Willow Project, a vast new fossil fuel development in Alaska. Despite the fierce opposition of environmental protesters, Biden has decided that the US, and indeed the world, still needs oil.If the Left-leaning, climate-friendly Biden can approve new energy projects, why can’t we do the same in the UK? No one could possibly accuse Biden of being a climate change denying reactionary. And yet in the US, unlike most of Europe, the debate about energy still has some vague connection to reality.It recognises that it will take a while and cost a lot to switch to renewables. In the meantime you will need oil and gas – and you might as well produce it yourself rather than buy it from Saudi Arabia.With plenty of reserves available in this country, perhaps it is time the UK learnt a lesson from Biden – and started to open up some new oil and gas fields of our own.President Biden is not ignoring climate change or in hock to the oil industry. He is spending so much money on putting the US at the forefront of the shift to green energy that every other country in the world is complaining about the support he is offering.From subsidies for electric vehicles, to investment in wind and solar power to building the infrastructure for carbon neutral heating, industrial and transport systems he is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to hit net zero as quickly as any other country. On any measure you care to look at, the Biden White House takes this stuff seriously.And yet, despite that, he is about to approve the biggest new oil field in years. Led by the energy giant ConocoPhillips, the Willow Project in Alaska has the capacity to generate 180,000 barrels of oil a day, or 1.5pc of the US’s total energy needs.Story continuesIt will add an extra third to Alaska’s annual production. Unsurprisingly, there has been an outcry from environmental activists, with opposition petitions attracting more than a million signatures, and accusations that Biden is breaking his election pledge not to allow new oil drilling on federal land (which, in fairness, has more than an element of truth to it).Even so, the president is poised to ignore all that and approve the project. Drilling could start before the end of the year.So if the United States, which is largely energy independent, can decide to go ahead with developing new fossil fuels, then why can’t we do the same in the UK?It is about being realistic. Renewable energy capacity takes a long time, and it will be years before we can switch heating systems and cars to electricity.In the meantime, we will still need oil and gas, and we might as well produce it ourselves, creating wealth, jobs and tax revenues in the process, instead of buying it from Russia or Saudi Arabia instead. In Washington, that is just obvious. In London, unfortunately, it still isn’t.The UK ought to get over its bone-headed opposition to new energy production. In the North Sea, producers have been harassed and taxed out of existence.Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish government did everything in its power to stop new licences being approved, even though it is one of the country’s most important industries. Windfall taxes have been slapped on the sector, with the Labour Party calling for those to be even higher.When energy giants such as Shell or BP announce bumper profits – hardly a surprise when energy prices are so high – they are vilified, and face calls for even stiffer levies. In response, projects have been put on hold, and investment stalled.Shell said last year it was ‘reviewing’ (corporate speak for scrapping) the money spent in the North Sea, and so has Norway’s Equinor. We can hardly complain if output is falling.The record on fracking has been even worse. Even though it enabled the US to be independent in energy, and although Texas has hardly been convulsed by earthquakes, in this country it has been effectively banned despite the fact we have vast reserves of shale oil and gas in the North.Liz Truss’s doomed pro-growth government briefly tried to revive it, but was shot down in a hail of opposition. The result? The UK has a huge deficit in energy, importing £2 billion more a month in oil alone than we export. But, heck, who cares. Apparently it is better to just buy energy from Qatar, or indeed from Biden’s America, than produce the stuff ourselves.That is ridiculous. It doesn’t make any difference to the environment whether the oil is extracted in this country or somewhere else.Nor does running down oil capacity do anything to speed up green technology. It just puts us at risk of shortages when supply is tight. Biden at least has the guts to realise we will still need oil for a while longer, and it might as well be American oil instead of anyone else’s.It might be too much to hope for from anyone in charge of British energy policy – but it is time we took a lesson from Washington and approved some new energy projects in this country as well.]"

Last year, scorching summer temperatures and a drought in China's southwest caused hydropower output to dwindle, leading to power outages.""We will strengthen the basic supporting role of coal (and) take orderly steps to increase advanced coal production while ensuring safety,"" said the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in a report to the annual gathering of parliament.China approved the construction of another 106 gigawatts of coal-fired power capacity last year, four times higher than a year earlier and the highest since 2015, driven by energy security considerations, research showed last week.About 50GW of that went into construction.""The energy security narrative is still going strong,"" said Greenpeace China policy advisor Li Shuo.""This has given impetus to China's coal sector as seen in the rapid approval of coal plants across the country,"" he said.Story continuesThe NDRC also stressed the importance of ramping up domestic oil and gas supply.""We will intensify the exploration and development of petroleum and natural gas at home to discover more untapped reserves and increase production,"" it said.Despite a strategy to boost use of natural gas as a bridge fuel to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality, China is slowing an aggressive campaign started in 2017 to replace coal with gas.Concerned about supply shortages amid high global prices, the planner pledged to ""strictly control the expansion of projects to replace coal with natural gas"".The state planner also reiterated its efforts to further reform the oil and gas sector, with a focus on improving the pricing mechanism for natural gas to better reflect the cost of production and procurement.China imports about 40% of its gas consumption.""(We shall) develop sound mechanisms to adjust urban end-user prices of natural gas in step with procurement costs,"" the report said.China will also push ahead with construction of a second batch of major wind and solar plants, they added.The reliance on coal was described as temporary by some to cover supply shortfalls as the country develops renewables.""New renewables generation has not been able to cover all the demand growth in any specific year, which means some additional coal generation is still needed each year,"" said David Fishman, senior manager of China-based energy consultancy the Lantau Group.""In 2023 or 2024 we might see the first year where renewable generation totally covers new demand growth ... after this coal consumption should start to decrease year-on-year,"" he said.China has pledged to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon-neutrality by 2060.Beijing is targeting reducing energy consumption per unit of GDP by around 2% in 2023, said the NDRC report.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy industry and go directly to the Top 5 Independent Oil and Gas Companies in the World.Independent oil and gas companies are neither publicly traded, nor state-owned, but are fully owned by private equity. These are the producers and/or distributors of various petrochemical products, including, but not limited to, crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. While most oil and gas companies specify their operations in terms of exploration and production (Upstream), transportation and storage (Midstream), and refining and marketing (Downstream), large companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) integrate all three streams within their operations.Latest Developments in the Energy IndustryAs a consequence of Russia’s war with Ukraine, which began at the start of 2022, there has been a surge in oil and gas prices across the globe. During the same year, the global oil demand also increased by 140,000 barrels per day. As a result, S&amp;P 500’s energy sector index grew by at least 58% in 2022 while the other 11 sectors were facing a downturn. This development has caused oil and gas giants to make record profits in the past year, and these values are expected to rise further in 2023. According to an estimate, the collective profits gained by the oil and gas industry worldwide increased by $2.5 trillion in 2022 alone. During this year, the profit made by the top oil and gas companies in the United States and Europe amounted to a whopping $150 billion. Among these, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) increased its annual revenue by $47.9 billion from the previous year and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s profits increased trifold from 2021. The British energy company Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), on the other hand, recorded a profit of $42.3 billion in the fiscal year 2022, which more than doubled from 2021. In this regard, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) were among the biggest winners in the energy industry in 2022.Story continuesOn the flip side, the oil and gas industry also had to face an increase in production costs, causing the collective upstream expenditure to grow by almost a hundred billion dollars, up to $450 billion in 2022.OutlookThe oil and gas industry is facing the challenge of meeting the global demand for energy while ensuring that it remains affordable and sustainable. To further complicate things, the World Bank has predicted that global growth will decrease to 2.7% in 2024, landing half of the European Union countries in a possible recession. This will lower the global demand for oil and gas. On the supply side, the non-OPEC suppliers of oil and gas are expected to increase their supply by 1.5bpd in 2023, with the United States contributing almost three-quarters of the total quantity. In the longer term, the world’s leading oil and gas companies have been forced to formulate their climate targets for 2030, after a group of investors campaigned for shifting the focus back to sustainable energy from energy security. According to McKinsey’s estimate, the global supply of oil will decrease in 2035 after reaching its peak in the year 2025. While this is bad news for the oil and gas industry at large, oilfield services and refineries, especially those in Europe, will face the brunt of the crisis. It is also imperative for countries such as Algeria and Azerbaijan, whose economies depend largely on oil revenue, to begin diversifying their revenue streams for the longer term.One of the biggest challenges that the energy industry is facing is the global shift towards decarbonization and clean energy. Many governments have started investing in sustainable energy sources in an attempt to minimize the use of fossil fuels. Denmark, for example, has decided to end the production of oil and gas in the North Sea by 2050. In these circumstances, oil and gas companies need to exhibit economic resilience while also adapting low-carbon practices. In this regard, Occidental Petroleum of the United States has taken the initiative by building a plant to bury around 500,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually. Top 15 Independent Oil and Gas Companies in the WorldPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list, we've defined ""independent companies"" as ones which are not public or state-owned, but privately held, since public companies are accountable to their investors and state-run companies are answerable to the state.We have further defined the top independent oil and gas companies in the world based on their revenue.

Oil executives who in years past were rewarded for investing in gigantic, long-term energy projects are now under the gun to funnel cash to investors who are increasingly convinced that the sunset of the fossil-fuel era is nigh.For the first time in at least a decade, US drillers last year spent more on share buybacks and dividends than on capital projects, according to Bloomberg calculations. The $128 billion in combined payouts across 26 companies also is the most since at least 2012, and they happened in a year when US President Joe Biden unsuccessfully appealed to the industry to lift production and relieve surging fuel prices. For Big Oil, rejecting the direct requests of the US government may never have been more profitable.At the heart of the divergence is growing concern among investors that demand for fossil fuels will peak as soon as 2030, obviating the need for mutlibillion-dollar megaprojects that take decades to yield full returns. In other words, oil refineries and natural-gas fired power plants — along with the wells that feed them — risk becoming so-called stranded assets if and when they are displaced by electric cars and battery farms.Story continues“The investment community is skeptical of what assets and energy prices will be,” John Arnold, the billionaire philanthropist and former commodities trader, said during a Bloomberg News interview in Houston. “They would rather have the money through buybacks and dividends to invest in other places. The companies have to respond to what the investment community is telling them to do otherwise they're not going to be in charge very long.”The upsurge in oil buybacks is helping drive a broader US corporate spending spree that saw share-repurchase announcements more than triple during the first month of 2023 to $132 billion, the highest ever to begin a year. Chevron Corp. alone accounted for more than half that total with a $75 billion, open-ended pledge. The White House lashed out and said that money would be better spent on expanding energy supplies. A 1% US tax on buybacks takes effect later this year.Global investment in new oil and gas supplies already is expected to fall short of the minimum needed to keep up with demand by $140 billion this year, according to Evercore ISI. Meanwhile, crude supplies are seen growing at such an anemic pace that the margin between consumption and output will narrow to just 350,000 barrels a day next year from 630,000 in 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration.“The companies have to respond to what the investment community is telling them to do otherwise they're not going to be in charge very long.” — Billionaire John ArnoldManagement teams from the biggest US oil companies recommitted to the investor-returns mantra as they unveiled fourth-quarter results in recent week and the 36% slump in domestic oil prices since mid-summer has only reinforced those convictions. Executives across the board now insist that funding dividends and buybacks takes priority over pumping additional crude to quell consumer discontent over higher pump prices. This may pose a problem in a matter of months as Chinese demand accelerates and global fuel consumption hits an all-time high.“Five years ago, you would have seen very significant year-on-year oil-supply growth, but you’re not seeing that today,” Arnold said. “It’s one of the bull stories for oil — that the supply growth that had come out of the US has now stopped.”The US is crucial to global crude supply not just because it’s the world’s biggest oil producer. Its shale resources can be tapped much more quickly than traditional reservoirs, meaning that the sector is uniquely placed to respond to price spikes. But with buybacks and dividends swallowing up more and more cash flow, shale is no longer the global oil system’s ace in the hole.In the waning weeks of 2022, shale specialists reinvested just 35% of their cash flow in drilling and other endeavors aimed at boosting supplies, down from more than 100% in the 2011-2017 period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A similar trend is evident among the majors, with Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron aggressively ramping buybacks while restraining capital spending to less than pre-Covid levels.Investors are driving this behavior, as evidenced by clear messages sent to domestic producers in the past two weeks. EOG Resources Inc., ConocoPhillips and Devon Energy Corp. dropped after announcing higher-than-expected 2023 budgets while Diamondback Energy Inc., Permian Resources Corp. and Civitas Resources Inc. all rose as they kept spending in check.On top of shareholder demands for cash, oil explorers also are grappling with higher costs, lower well productivity and shrinking portfolios of top-notch drilling locations. Chevron and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. are two high-profile producers reorganizing drilling plans after weaker-than-expected well results. Labor costs also are rising, according to Janette Marx, CEO of Airswift, one of the world’s biggest oil recruiters.US oil production is expected to grow just 5% this year to 12.5 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Next year, the expansion is expected to slow to just 1.3%, the agency says. While the US is adding more supply than most of the rest of the world, it’s a marked contrast to the heady days of shale in the previous decade when the US was adding more than 1 million barrels of daily output each year, competing with OPEC and influencing global prices.Demand, rather than supply-side actors like the American shale sector or OPEC, will be the primary driver of prices this year, Dan Yergin, Pulitzer Price-winning oil historian and vice chairman of S&amp;P Global, said during an inteview.“Oil prices will be determined by, metaphorically speaking, Jerome Powell and Xi Jinping,” Yergin said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike path and China’s post-pandemic recovery. S&amp;P Global expects global oil demand to reach an all-time high of 102 million barrels per day.With the case for higher oil prices building, US President Joe Biden has fewer tools at his disposal with which to counteract the blow to consumers. The president already has tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the tune of 180 million barrels in a bid to ease gasoline prices as they were spiking in 2022. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is likely to get a frosty reception at the CERAWeek by S&amp;P Global event in Houston staring March 6 if she follows Biden’s lead and attacks the industry for giving too much back to investors. That business model is “here to stay,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners.“There’s going to be a point at which the US needs to produce more because the market is going to demand it,” Pickering said. “That’s probably when investor sentiment shifts to growth. Until then, returning capital seems like the best idea.”--With assistance from Lu Wang and Tom Contiliano.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out—Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsHow Countries Leading on Early Years of Child Care Get It RightMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision Deal©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This makes the dividend yield 2.3%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve Flowserve's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Flowserve was earning enough to cover the dividend, but it wasn't generating any free cash flows. Since a dividend means the company is paying out cash to investors, this could prove to be a problem in the future.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 72.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 32% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendFlowserve Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.48 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.2% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Flowserve has been growing its earnings per share at 135% a year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Our Thoughts On Flowserve's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Flowserve (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.

8,69ad8341-6bfa-35a7-a0a2-ef3ff4d9ac2f,MRO,2023-03-05,Marathon Oil Corporation's (NYSE:MRO) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-corporations-nyse-mro-132314200.html,1677936194,STORY,['MRO'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Marathon Oil's (NYSE:MRO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 11% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Marathon Oil's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marathon Oil is:32% = US$3.6b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.32 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Marathon Oil's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Marathon Oil has an impressive ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 30% the company's ROE is pretty decent. Given the circumstances, the significant 41% net income growth seen by Marathon Oil over the last five years is not surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Marathon Oil's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MRO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MRO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Marathon Oil Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Marathon Oil's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 6.2%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it looks like Marathon Oil is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Besides, Marathon Oil has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 10.0% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 17% over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Marathon Oil's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(As You Sow)What began in 2016 as a list of companies leading in clean energy has since expanded to encompass revenue that meets a range of sustainability certifications from electric vehicles to sustainable loans. The list excludes companies with exposure to controversial business practices such as investments in fossil fuels, weapons, and prisons or otherwise ""having a record of systemically obstructing climate policy.""""These are the companies that are leading the way by putting sustainability at the heart of their products, services, business models and investments, helping to move the world onto a more sustainable trajectory,"" the report stated.This year's Clean 200 list also spanned 35 countries, with the most companies listed in the U.S., China, and Japan. And with the exception of energy, there was broad sector representation: Industrials companies were prevalent as were information technology, materials, and utility companies.Story continues“It's not just clean energy,” Toby Heaps, CEO of Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s the entire economy, from Google's advertising that comes from sustainability-focused companies to plant-based milks.”Employees wear green shirts near Apple's familiar logo displayed with a green leaf at the Apple Store timed to coincide with Tuesday's annual celebration of Earth Day in Sydney, Tuesday, April 22, 2014. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft)Apple gets serious about its supply chainsApple has made strides in recent years in using recycled materials and rare earth minerals.""Over time, they've really kind of gone to town on their whole supply chain,"" Heaps explained. ""They're getting zero-carbon or almost zero-carbon aluminum and making the iPhone... We've looked at about 300 eco-labels, certifications, and Apple now builds... a large enough chunk of its products that they qualify for the high standards.""Apple's sustainable revenue primarily comes from the sale of iPhones, iPads, and Macs, all of which have been awarded EPEAT Gold certification. Criteria for the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global ecolabel considers hardware products' materials, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions, product longevity, energy conservation, and end-of-life management, among other factors.The company offers eight devices with more than 20% recycled material, according to its 2022 sustainability report. The 2020 MacBook Air with an M1 chip has the highest amount of recycled materials — 44% of the laptop is recycled, including a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.As of 2021, Apple began using recycled gold and tungsten in all of its iPhones. Apple shipped roughly 225 million iPhones in 2022.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.At the same time, Apple is far from perfect when it comes to selling sustainably-sourced products at scale. The tech giant has come under pressure from consumers and governments who have argued the company makes it too difficult to repair its devices, leading to shorter life cycles for its electronics.Despite launching Self Service Repair, a platform that lets customers order parts and browse instructions for repairing devices, Apple has thrown its weight against state right-to-repair laws, including a watered-down law passed in New York in 2022.What Google and Tesla also get rightGoogle has consistently ranked among the top two Clean 200 companies over the past several years.Google's clean revenue primarily derives from advertising on Google Maps, which has features aimed at reducing carbon emissions in transportation, as well as cloud services powered by renewable energy.And Tesla, Elon Musk's electric vehicle company, has been a pioneer in increasing the adoption of EVs and decarbonizing the transportation sector. At the same time, the company has underperformed on other ESG metrics, such as taxes paid and labor controversies.""Tesla is a poor discloser of operational metrics, and where it does disclose, it scores bottom quartile performance on waste and taxes paid (just 4.7% of EBITDA paid in cash taxes over the past five years),"" Matthew Malinsky, research manager at Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. ""But Tesla has excellent products focused on EVs. So when you apply 50% weight to products and 50% to operations, Tesla is the most sustainable car company in the U.S., and one of the most sustainable companies on the planet.""Tesla electric vehicles are lined up and charging their batteries in this outdoor public charging station just north of Santa Barbara on March 18, 2022, in Goleta, California. Photo by George Rose/Getty Images)Microsoft and Amazon missing from listTwo big corporate names with ambitious climate pledges were noticeably absent from the Clean 200 list.So why aren't Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) among the sustainable giants? It mostly comes down to disclosures.Microsoft's actions have primarily focused on its operations, such as renewable energy projects and managing water usage. However, Malinsky noted, the company doesn't provide enough detailed information about product revenue to determine the portion coming from technologies that are supporting the low-carbon economy transition.Likewise, Amazon shoppers may recognize the ""Climate Pledge Friendly"" label when shopping online, but the actual level of sustainability varies widely for the self-reported eco-label.For instance, Heaps said that some products may receive the label if they have eco-friendly packaging, regardless of what the product is, whereas other products may qualify under more rigorous standards.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announces the Climate Pledge, setting a goal to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 19, 2019. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)Research shows that overall, companies with stronger ESG risk management practices tend to outperform benchmark peers over the long run.Since July 2016, when the list was created, Clean 200 companies have outperformed the MSCI ACWI broad market index by 3.36%, the report stated, despite being underweight U.S. equities and energy stocks in 2022, a year when oil and gas companies benefitted from higher prices.Heaps stressed that this demonstrates that even when investors use a ""fine tooth comb"" to weed out greenwashing — the practice of overstating sustainability credentials — there is no shortage of investable companies.“This transformation that many have said is the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution is in full swing,” As You Sow's Behar said. “It’s not a clean energy future, it is a clean energy present — and it is scaling rapidly.”(As You Sow)Grace is a special projects editor for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Schlumberger is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$43b - US$12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 13%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Energy Services industry average of 7.7% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceIn the above chart we have measured Schlumberger's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Schlumberger.How Are Returns Trending?We're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Schlumberger. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 159%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 45% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. Schlumberger may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesThe Bottom LineFrom what we've seen above, Schlumberger has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Since the total return from the stock has been almost flat over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here if the valuation looks good. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.If you want to continue researching Schlumberger, you might be interested to know about the 3 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Schlumberger isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The academy banned Smith from attending the Oscars for 10 years.Story continuesThe comedy special was the first event streamed live on Netflix, which is testing the technology as it considers expanding into other real-time programming.Netflix agreed to pay $40 million for two Rock comedy specials under a deal reached in 2016, according to a person familiar with the matter. Saturday's special was the second of the two.Rock spent most of the show riffing on topics ranging from Britain's royal family to the Kardashians, abortion and his dating life. He concluded by saying why he did not fight back when Smith hit him.""I got parents, and you know what my parents taught me?"" he said. ""Don't fight in front of white people.""

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.Gold price has been in a seesaw mode as investors continue to weigh and predict the next move of the Federal Reserve in light of fresh data that shows the continuing strength of the US labor market, stubborn inflation and strong consumer spending. The safe-haven asset hardly loses its shine no matter what the market environment is. A CNBC report in January quoted Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, who said in a note that gold price has seen a boost amid the reopening of China. The analyst noted the People’s Bank of China’s announcement that it bought 62 tons of gold during the last two months of the year. In this backdrop, gold stocks like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) have been gaining attention.An ""Outrageous"" Prediction About GoldHansen is making headlines for his “outrageous” prediction that gold price will hit $3,000 in 2023. The analyst thinks inflation is here to stay and gold price will receive a huge boost from a variety of reasons including geopolitical tensions and demand from China. Here is how the analyst explains his rationale:“In 2023, the hardest of currencies receives a further blast of support from three directions. First, the geopolitical backdrop of an increasing war economy mentality of self reliance and minimizing holdings of foreign FX reserves, preferring gold. Second, the massive investment in new national security priorities, including energy sources, the energy transition, and supply chains. Third, rising global liquidity as policy makers move to avoid a debacle in debt markets as a mild real  growth recession (certainly not in nominal prices, however!) takes hold. Gold slices through the double top near USD 2,075 as if it wasn’t there and hurtles to at least USD 3,000 next year.”Story continuesThe report also quoted David Neuhauser, founder and chief investment officer at Livermore Partners, who told CNBC in an interview that he expects gold to gain on the current momentum. Here’s what the analyst said:“I think as you look forward, you start to look around and think ‘where is the safest place for your investment in terms of assets?’ and the only place really to go as an alternative now is gold, in terms of knowing that you are not going to see that debasement of your assets.”Most Promising Gold Stocks According to AnalystsOur MethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify gold stocks whose average analyst price estimates are at least 20% higher than their current levels as of February 21.

SSR Mining is a precious metals mining company that we previously sold in November 2021 after it reached our valuation. SSR Mining’s stock has fallen significantly this year due to lower precious metal prices and the temporary closure of its Copler mine. We repurchased its shares in late September after the Copler mine restarted on schedule, since the stock remained depressed. SSR Mining should generate significant free cash flow at current gold and silver prices and has a very strong balance sheet with over $600 million in net cash and $4.1 billion in stockholders’ equity. While we expect the stock to remain volatile, we believe the company is selling at an attractive price relative to its asset-heavy balance sheet and our net asset valuation.”6.

25,300ee540-3746-32ca-9aca-1eed698039fb,NEM,2023-03-05,The 3 Best Recession Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-recession-stocks-buy-005937030.html,1677718777,STORY,"['PFE', 'NEM', 'COST']","[Be it a slowdown or recession, portfolios need readjustment and relatively high exposure to some of the best recession stocks for 2023. In my opinion, the best recession stocks would typically be low-beta stocks for capital preservation. Additionally, a healthy dividend yield would provide investors with regular cash flows. It’s an added bonus if these stocks are trading at a valuation gap. Total returns can be robust once market sentiments reverse. Coming to the recession fears, economists peg the probability of recession at 61% for the year. Amidst this concern, the good news is that aggressive monetary policy tightening is likely to end. In general, a weaker dollar is positive for risky asset classes. However, for now, it makes sense to remain cautiously optimistic. Let’s discuss three of the best recession stocks for 2023.PFEPfizer$40.18NEMNewmont Corporation$44.10COSTCostco$478.67Pfizer (PFE)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockPfizer (NYSE:PFE) may not have performed well in the last 12 months. However, there are multiple reasons to consider PFE stock at current prices. For one, PFE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.4, which is attractive here. Furthermore, the stock has an attractive dividend yield of 4.08% and appears sustainable. Also, in a recession scenario, it makes sense to consider exposure to the pharmaceutical sector. Reason: cash flows are relatively immune to economic fluctuations.It’s also worth noting that Pfizer has a deep pipeline of drug candidates. As drugs are commercialized, revenue growth is likely to remain steady. Further, with robust free cash flows, Pfizer has been active on the acquisition front. This has helped the company broaden its product pipeline. It’s being reported that Pfizer is in talks for a potential buyout of Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN). The offer could be potentially worth $30 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesNewmont Corporation (NEM)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) was understandably weak in 2022. After all, gold was trending lower with aggressive contractionary monetary policies. However, NEM now appears attractive with a dividend yield of 3.67%. In a recession scenario, the dollar is likely to weaken. This will be positive for gold and I expect the recent uptrend in the precious metal to sustain. Factors such as geopolitical tensions and inflation are also likely to support gold upside. As realized gold prices improve, Newmont will be positioned to deliver healthy free cash flows. I, therefore, expect NEM stock to trend higher in a recession scenario.From a fundamental perspective, Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet and $6.7 billion in liquidity buffer. As free cash flows swell, the company will be positioned to increase dividends. Also, with 96 million ounces of proven reserves, the company has had steady cash flow visibility through the decade.Costco (COST)a figure of a shopper standing on top of a credit cardSource: ShutterstockThe Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock looks attractive among retailers. For Jan. Costco reported sales growth of 6.9% on a year-on-year basis. Sales growth has sustained and Costco continues to report robust cash flows. Costco has also strengthened its omnichannel presence through the pandemic. It’s also worth noting that for the last 12 months, Costco reported $4.3 billion in the membership fee. With a high renewal rate and the opening of new stores, recurring revenue will continue to swell. COST stock is therefore among the best dividend stocks to consider.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As gold bull Juerg Kiener, managing director, and chief investment officer of Swiss Asia Capital, told CNBC late last year, gold could surge to $4,000 per ounce.Undergirding this optimistic thesis stands Kiener’s belief that many economies still suffer from recessionary conditions. Therefore, some central banks may slow their pace of interest rate hikes, making precious metals much more attractive. In turn, this dynamic could bolster compelling gold stocks to buy. As well, the World Gold Council reported that central banks bought 400 tonnes of gold in the third quarter. This tally nearly doubled the previous record of 241 tonnes during the same period in 2018.“Since [the] 2000s, the average return [on] gold in any currency is somewhere between 8% and 10% a year. You haven’t achieved that in the bond market. You have not achieved that in the equity market,” Kiener remarked. If you feel the same way, below are potentially attractive gold stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRGLDRoyal Gold$120.80WPMWheaton Precious Metals$41.61CGAUCenterra Gold$6.54NEMNewmont$44.10AUYYamana Gold$5.22GFIGold Fields$9.24GOLDBarrick Gold$16.31Royal Gold (RGLD)A pile of shining gold bars.Source: ShutterstockBilled as one of the world’s leading precious metals stream and royalty companies, Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) owns a large portfolio of producing, development, evaluation, and exploration stage streams and royalties. Generally, it’s fared better than other gold stocks to buy across recent sessions. Since the Jan. opener, RGLD gained a bit over 1%. And in the trailing year, it’s down 2.5%, mitigating some of the sharp losses seen in the space.While the precious metals complex presents volatility risks, Royal Gold assuages fears with a solid fiscal profile. Operationally, the company commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 12.5%, ranked better than 64.2% of its peers. On the bottom line, the enterprise features a net margin of nearly 40%. This stat outpaces almost 93% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg RGLD as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $132.57, implying over 12% upside potential.Story continuesWheaton Precious Metals (WPM)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockBased in Canada, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) specializes in streaming gold and silver assets. Rather than mining the metals themselves, Wheaton provides upfront capital to mining specialists. In return, Wheaton receives a portion of the metals extracted. Because of the inherently improved predictability of the streaming business model, WPM ranks among the more stable gold stocks to buy.For instance, since the January opener, WPM gained over 1%. In the trailing year, it mitigated losses to 6% below parity. While it’s still in the red, several other direct mining plays suffered far steeper losses.To be fair, Gurufocus.com identifies WPM as a modestly overvalued investment. However, the company enjoys several strong fiscal attributes. Perhaps most notably, it features an extremely stable balance sheet. For instance, its Altman Z-Score shot up into the triple digits, signifying extremely low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, Wheaton benefits from solid sales growth and excellent profit margins.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg WPM as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $47.77, implying 16% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a solid case for gold stocks to buy.Centerra Gold (CGAU)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comAlso based in Canada, Centerra Gold (NYSE:CGAU) owns and operates the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in its home turf of British Columbia. As well, it owns and operates a gold mine in Turkey. As a warning, Centerra represents one of the big movers among gold stocks to buy. But that also applies in both directions.For example, since the Jan. opener, CGAU shot up nearly 18%, an impressive haul. Fundamentally, initial speculation that the Federal Reserve will loosen its aggressive rate hike policy bolstered CGAU. However, in the trailing year, shares gave up more than 35% of equity value.Still, it could be an interesting gamble for gold bugs. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), Centerra rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the market prices CGAU at a trailing book multiple of 0.76. As a discount to book, Centerra ranks better than nearly 79% of the competition. Presently, covering analysts peg CGAU as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $7.69, implying nearly 22% upside potential.Newmont (NEM)A gold bar along with some coins made of precious metals. gold stocksSource: allstars / Shutterstock.comFor those that want to take a speculative walk down gold stocks to buy, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) now offers that opportunity. Fundamentally, that’s not how this was supposed to happen. Per its website, Newmont represents the world’s leading gold company. In addition to yellow metal, it produces copper, silver, zinc, and lead. At the time of writing, Newmont sports a market capitalization of over $35 billion.Despite its massive footprint, investors took a dim view of NEM and its prospects. Since the Jan. opener, NEM gave up almost 13% of its equity value. And in the trailing year, shares plunged over 34%. Looking at the financials, Newmont looks riskier. For instance, Gurufocus.com warns it’s a possible value trap.Still, it still carries positive attributes, including an operating margin of 13.47%. This stat outpaces 68% of sector peers. Also, the sheer size and relevance of this enterprise give it considerable come-back credibility. Wall Street analysts apparently feel the same, pegging NEM as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $55.11, implying over 27% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the possible ideas for gold stocks to buy.Yamana Gold (AUY)Gold nuggets on top of American paper money representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockAnother Canadian mining firm, Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY) owns and operates gold, silver, and copper mines in Canada, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina. To be sure, it’s an odd performer. Since the start of the year, AUY gave up nearly 12% of its equity value. However, in the trailing 365 days, shares gained over 3%.Also, in the trailing five years, AUY stands at nearly 72% above parity. Therefore, slow and steady may be the best way to approach Yamana. At the moment, Gurufocus.com labels AUY as a fairly valued investment. Objectively, the market prices AUY at a trailing book multiple of 1.13. As a discount to this metric, Yamana ranks better than 64.51% of the competition.Operationally, the company enjoys strong profitability. For instance, its operating margin pings at 26.88%, bidding out 83.57% of its rivals. Also, its return on equity is 5.88%, above 81% of its peers, thus reflecting an extremely high-quality business. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg AUY as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $6.68, implying nearly 32% upside potential.Gold Fields (GFI)Closeup of a large gold nugget. stocks under $10Source: ShutterstockRepresenting one of the world’s largest gold mining firms, Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI) calls resource-rich South Africa home. Per its public profile, the company owns and operates mines in South Africa, Ghana, Australia, and Peru. Unfortunately, Gold Fields’ massive size hasn’t been too much of a help in the charts.Since the Jan. opener, shares tumbled nearly 16%. In the trailing year, they gave up 35% of equity value. Still, the erosion in price may be a selling point for speculators. For example, the company’s price-earnings-growth ratio now sits at 0.36 times. In contrast, the sector median PEG ratio is 0.85. This ranks Gold Fields better than 75% of its peers.Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 17.6%, beating out 75.55% of competitors. Its net margin is 16.3%, above 78.43% of the industry. Looking at the Street’s guidance, GFI enjoys a consensus moderate buy rating. Moreover, experts believe GFI will hit $12.50, implying 37% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the higher-risk, higher-reward gold stocks to buy.Barrick Gold (GOLD)gold bars representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) produces gold and copper with 16 operating sites in 13 countries. On paper, it should be one of the more relevant gold stocks to buy. The target asset fundamentally represents a hedge against inflation and overall economic uncertainty. And copper is a critical component of myriad industries, including electric vehicles.Sadly for stakeholders, this relevancy didn’t spare GOLD volatility. Since the Jan. opener, shares stumbled over 10%. And in the trailing year, they gave up over 29% of equity value. Still, Gurufocus.com labels GOLD as modestly undervalued per its FMV calculations. Objectively, the market prices GOLD at a trailing book multiple of 1.23. As a discount to the metric, Barrick ranks better than 60.36% of the industry.Notably, Barrick features an operating margin of 27.25%, beating out 84% of its peers. As well, it enjoys six years of profitability over the past decade. Finally, covering analysts peg GOLD as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $22.09, implying over 38% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

They're often trying to discover assets that a bigger company would later take on,"" Christopher told Bloomberg ahead of the world's premier mineral exploration and mining conference in Toronto beginning on March 5.Weeks before the conference, several major mining deals were announced or completed. Rio Tinto, for example, has completed its acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources for around $3.1 billion, significantly strengthening Rio Tinto's copper portfolio. B2Gold has agreed to buy Sabina Gold &amp; Silver Corp and its gold-mining project in Canada, while mining giant BHP could be close to its biggest acquisition in over a decade with the proposal to buy Australian copper-gold producer OZ Minerals.Companies are adding more copper assets in view of an expected copper supply crunch in the energy transition. A huge shortage of copper is looming, mining and commodities giant Glencore said at the end of last year, reiterating warnings from other industry players and analysts that a supply crunch could slow the energy transition.Growing efforts at decarbonization are raising demand for key metals such as lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel.The energy transition was the key driver behind 25% of the top 20 mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals in mining in 2022, as the industry responded to consumer and shareholder demand for portfolio diversification and sustainability, data and analytics company GlobalData said in a report last month.""Mining companies are shifting their portfolios to focus more on future-facing metals,"" William Tyson, Associate Analyst, Thematic Intelligence at GlobalData, said, commenting on the report.""The shortages of these metals and the growth in demand for EVs have prompted M&amp;A deal activity as mining companies consolidate to fill the gap in supply."" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Trade Is Moving Away From EuropeSmall Nuclear Reactors Get Boost As Western Cities Vote ‘Yes’Shell Is Reviewing Its Plan To Reduce Oil Production This DecadeRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.Gold price has been in a seesaw mode as investors continue to weigh and predict the next move of the Federal Reserve in light of fresh data that shows the continuing strength of the US labor market, stubborn inflation and strong consumer spending. The safe-haven asset hardly loses its shine no matter what the market environment is. A CNBC report in January quoted Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, who said in a note that gold price has seen a boost amid the reopening of China. The analyst noted the People’s Bank of China’s announcement that it bought 62 tons of gold during the last two months of the year. In this backdrop, gold stocks like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) have been gaining attention.An ""Outrageous"" Prediction About GoldHansen is making headlines for his “outrageous” prediction that gold price will hit $3,000 in 2023. The analyst thinks inflation is here to stay and gold price will receive a huge boost from a variety of reasons including geopolitical tensions and demand from China. Here is how the analyst explains his rationale:“In 2023, the hardest of currencies receives a further blast of support from three directions. First, the geopolitical backdrop of an increasing war economy mentality of self reliance and minimizing holdings of foreign FX reserves, preferring gold. Second, the massive investment in new national security priorities, including energy sources, the energy transition, and supply chains. Third, rising global liquidity as policy makers move to avoid a debacle in debt markets as a mild real  growth recession (certainly not in nominal prices, however!) takes hold. Gold slices through the double top near USD 2,075 as if it wasn’t there and hurtles to at least USD 3,000 next year.”Story continuesThe report also quoted David Neuhauser, founder and chief investment officer at Livermore Partners, who told CNBC in an interview that he expects gold to gain on the current momentum. Here’s what the analyst said:“I think as you look forward, you start to look around and think ‘where is the safest place for your investment in terms of assets?’ and the only place really to go as an alternative now is gold, in terms of knowing that you are not going to see that debasement of your assets.”Most Promising Gold Stocks According to AnalystsOur MethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify gold stocks whose average analyst price estimates are at least 20% higher than their current levels as of February 21.

SSR Mining’s stock has fallen significantly this year due to lower precious metal prices and the temporary closure of its Copler mine. We repurchased its shares in late September after the Copler mine restarted on schedule, since the stock remained depressed. SSR Mining should generate significant free cash flow at current gold and silver prices and has a very strong balance sheet with over $600 million in net cash and $4.1 billion in stockholders’ equity. While we expect the stock to remain volatile, we believe the company is selling at an attractive price relative to its asset-heavy balance sheet and our net asset valuation.”6.

But now they are also demanding the resignation of President Dina Boluarte following protests that left dozens dead.Residents of Espinar and Chumbivilcas provinces agreed to the strike in the Cusco region on Monday and from Tuesday will resume the blockade of the ""mining corridor"", used by Chinese MMG Ltd's Las Bambas, Glencore's Antapaccay and Hubbay Minerals's Constancia mines.""We are supporting the protest against the government,"" said the coordinator of the communities in the Antapaccay area of influence in the province of Espinar, Flavio Huanque.According to the Espinar agreement document, seen by Reuters, the communities also agreed to demand the stoppage from Monday of operations at Antapaccay, Las Bambas and Constancia.""That is the agreement, from Monday we start the regional strike and we are going to block the highway,"" Carlos Quispe, one of the leaders of the defense front of the province of Chumbivilcas, told Reuters.Reuters reported this week that large mining companies in the Peruvian Andes were seeking to resume their production gradually after the corridor was unblocked, despite the climate of uncertainty and social upheaval.Las Bambas, which produces 2% of the world's copper and began operating in 2016, has largely withstood the constant stoppages, while the Antapaccay deposit suffered in January the burning of part of its camp after an attack by protesters and is still in the process of reopening.

She landed a 900 and back-to-back 720s. Canadian Rachael Karker took bronze.“It’s unbelievable,” Faulhaber said, according to U.S. Ski and Snowboard. “I’m really at a loss of words right now. I shed a couple tears, and wow. That is really the only word I can use to describe it right now — wow.”China’s Eileen Gu, the Olympic and world champion the previous two years, missed worlds after suffering a season-ending MCL strain, ACL strain and bone bruise in a heavy training crash at X Games practice in January.Faulhaber has been on skis since age 2 1/2, starting in moguls, then inspired to take up halfpipe by watching the X Games near her Colorado hometown.Before Faulhaber, all nine U.S. women to win an individual freestyle skiing world title did it in aerials or moguls, the last being aerialist Ashley Caldwell in 2017. In the freeskiing events of halfpipe, slopestyle and big air, American woman racked up eight silver or bronze medals dating to 2005 before Faulhaber’s breakthrough.Podmilsak scored 91.25 and 96.50 on his first two runs in the three-run big air final, enough for gold over Austrian Lukas Muellauer. Olympic champion Birk Ruud of Norway earned bronze.“Actually nothing was going through my head; I kind of went into this zone where I didn’t actually exist,” said Podmilsak, who made his major championships debut at last month’s X Games, finishing sixth. “I wasn’t nervous. I wasn’t angry. I wasn’t tired.

Perry; CFO &amp; Corporate Secretary; Gold Resource CorporationPresentationOperatorGood morning, and welcome to the Gold Resource Corporation Full Year 2022 Financial and Operating Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, March 3, 2023 at 8 a.m. Mountain Time. I will now turn the conference over to Kim Perry, Gold Resource Corporation's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.Kimberly C. PerryThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Gold Resource team, I would like to welcome you to our conference call covering our full year 2022 results. Before we begin the call, there are a couple of housekeeping matters I would like to address. Please note that certain statements to be made today are forward-looking in nature and, as such, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. All financial measures are unaudited. Audited financial statements will be presented in our 2022 Form 10-K which will be filed at a future date, but no later than March 15 once our audit firm completes their audit procedures. Please note, all amounts referenced during this presentation are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. Joining me on the call today is Allen Palmiere, our President and CEO; and Alberto Reyes, our Chief Operating Officer. Following Allen, Alberto and my prepared remarks, we will be available to answer your questions. This conference call is being webcast. For those of you joining us on the webcast, you can download a PDF copy of the conference call slides. The event will also be available for replay on our website later today. Yesterday's news release issued following the close of the market, and the accompanying updated technical summary report have been filed with the SEC and EDGAR and are also available on our website at www.goldresourcecorp.com. I will now turn the call over to Allen.Story continuesAllen Joseph PalmiereThank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank the listeners for taking the time to join us on this call. While we exceeded production guidance in 2022, the expected production results for 2023 are expected to decline approximately 25%, driven almost entirely by grade. The forecast for 2023, while generating cash flow sufficient to main our capital needs in Mexico and cover our anticipated expenditures elsewhere is tight. We took a very difficult decision to pause the dividend to protect our debt-free balance sheet. Admittedly, it is a conservative stance, but we are strongly of the belief the best way to create long-term value is to preserve our cash to ensure that we can unlock the value in the Don David Gold Mine. Our values underscore transparency and as such, we strive to ensure we keep our investment community fully apprised of information as soon as it is available. Later in the call, Kim will share more details about our 2023 guidance. We are focused on improving our cash flow through productivity improvements assessing our level of staffing and hopefully, through exploration success, which will be discussed in just a moment. A little teaser for the readers, we will publish our inaugural ESG report next week, which highlights the many ESG programs aimed at not only compliance, but also at maintaining our social license to operate by being a good neighbor to our host communities and steward of the environment. After an update on our Don David Gold operations by Alberto and prepared remarks by Kim on our financials, I'd like to provide an update on our Back Forty Project. Lastly, we'll provide a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions from participants. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll provide an update on our Q4 exploration results. Our #1 priority is to continue to fund the capital programs at DDGM, including our infill and expansion exploration programs in Mexico. These programs have only been constrained by available drill sites, and this remains true this year. We have never withheld capital for drilling. Unfortunately, we encountered delays in our exploration development during 2022, which resulted in being approximately 6 months behind in our drilling program. These delays involved ventilation and ground support and as the impact of working conditions and the safety of our employees that were not something that could be ignored and resulted in a delay. The technical issue was resolved in the fourth quarter, and we're currently drilling in highly prospective areas to the southeast of Switchback, the Three Sisters and the Marena target parallel to the Arista vein system. As you will have seen from our press release on Tuesday, the initial results are very encouraging and give us confidence in the potential for additional high-grade results. While it takes time to develop a resource from initial drilling, we are excited about the future. It is our objective to increase our resources and reserves this year through exploration and infill drilling programs. On Slide 5, you can see that our commitment to exploration spending since 2021 has been significant. While 2023 appears to decline from 2022, this is largely due to the development work I mentioned earlier, largely conducted in 2022. We are now in a position with drill stations and drilling has commenced. We will still have additional development requirements in 2023. However, they are not as significant as 2022. As you can see from the graph, the significant spend in 2023 relates to underground exploration expansion and infill drilling. Turning to Slide 6. We are confident in the long term at DDGM, as you'll see in the updated technical summary report filed yesterday with our 8-K. In the 12/31/22 resource model, excluding inferred material and not including the recent drill results, represents more than a 6-year mine life. We are able to replace 88% of our resources by performing infill drilling, a comprehensive view of our geological database and interpretation of the mineralization and the block models derived from them. On Slide 7, you'll see that we were able to replace reserves to the extent of 74%. The largest contributing factors 26% decline was the depletion of the reserves by 0.5 million tons relating to 2022 mining activities, offset by additions due to the reclassification of measured and indicated mineral resources to proven and probable reserves as a result of detailed engineering. I'll now pass the presentation over to Alberto to discuss the Don David Gold's full year operational results.Alberto ReyesThank you, Allen, and also good morning to all. Starting with operational health and safety, I am pleased to report the significant progress the operations team has made in cultivating a mature safety culture. The team has surpassed its quota on leading indicators and the results are reflected in an increased number of reports, while accidents and incidents continue to trend down. I am proud of the team for actively participating in identifying and correcting hazards in the workplace while partaken and campaigns, committees and the type of leadership that reinforces safety. The results and safety stats for 2023 have been impressive so far, and I'm confident that the team will continue improving the safety culture. Regarding the operations, the team was able to achieve production targets, despite the ground support needed during the construction of the ventilation raised between levels 22 and 27. Moreover, the completion of the last leg of the ventilation system has significantly improved working conditions, enabling the team to safely pursue new production targets and continuing exploration from drilling stations at the lower levels. Production increased quarter-over-quarter. The changes made to the sequence in Q4 gave access to the higher-grade material obtained from a section in the upper part of Northern Switchback that was only identified in 2022 through infill drilling. I am pleased to report that we process nearly 0.5 million tonnes of ore and sold approximately 30,000 ounces of gold, 1 million ounces of silver, equating to a combined nearly 43,000 gold equivalent ounces. We further sold over 1,300 tonnes of copper, approximately 5,000 tonnes of lead and more than 14,000 tonnes of zinc. Turning to Slide 9. In 2022, our capital expenditure of $14.8 million paid the road for production in 2023. Some of the highlights include the completion of the gold regrind circuit, the dry stack facility and approximately 4,100 meters of development for exploration purposes as well as for access to other mining levels. In other sustaining capital $3.2 million was invested in replacing some mining equipment, surface mine ventilation infrastructure and an electrical substation for the lower levels. This investment is aligned with the company's vision of sustainably growing Don David Gold Mine. I'll now pass over the presentation to Kim to discuss the financial results.Kimberly C. PerryThank you, Alberto. As previously noted, our 2022 Form 10-K will be filed in a few days Once our Audit firm has an opportunity to wrap up the audit. Therefore, all financial measures discussed are unaudited. We closed the year with a strong balance sheet, consisting of nearly $24 million in cash at December 31, 2022. Cash in 2022 declined by $10 million due to nearly $19 million in tax payments made for both 2021 and 2022, a $22 million investment in DDGM exploration and capital projects, a nearly $9 million investment in the Back Forty Project, a $1.7 million investment in Maritime Resources Corporation and nearly $4 million distributed in dividends prior to suspension. For the full year 2022, we reported net losses of $6.3 million. These losses are primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense and the Back Forty Project costs being reflected as an expense on the P&amp;L. The increase in depreciation expense reflects the addition of the filtration plant dry stack facilities and the addition of the Gold regrind circuit, offset by lower mineral reserve depreciation base. Net sales of nearly $140 million were 11% higher than the same period in 2021 due to both higher sales volumes and commodity prices for gold and zinc. Total production cost of approximately $81 million for the year are 12% higher than the production cost for the same period in 2021. The increase is largely related to increased costs across the board for the same period in 2021. Specifically, labor costs were higher due to both inflation and an increase in headcount as a result of the 2021 Mexican labor reform. However, in Q4 2022, we commenced the exercise of rightsizing our workforce for the future. Secondly, cost of materials consumed and transportation of concentrates for both higher due to inflation. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage this risk. As Alberto mentioned earlier, we incurred additional costs related to ground support and ventilation remediation that will also continue to benefit us in the future. Don David Gold Mine's total cash cost after co-product credits was $458 per gold equivalent ounce sold and total all-in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce sold were $1,022 for the full year. These costs were slightly higher than 2021 costs related to the higher production costs just discussed. Moving on to Slide 11. I'd like to discuss our 2023 guidance. The 2 headlines are the year-over-year reduction in gold equivalent ounces and the increase in cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce. The gold and silver production profile was primarily driven by expected decline in metal grades, as Allen mentioned, However, as both Allen and Alberto mentioned, there are many productivity measures being taken to address this decline in both grade and the overall production profile. With regard to cash cost, you will notice significant increase from 2022. The unit cost increase is driven primarily by the decline in the gold equivalent ounces sold. As mentioned throughout this presentation, we are laser-focused on improving operating cash flows. The 2023 guidance further demonstrates the commitment to continue investing both capital and exploration in Mexico and the final (inaudible) on G&amp;A, which is driven by the addition of highly skilled resources to our team.(technical difficulty)I think Allen might be on mute.Allen Joseph PalmiereNo, I'm here. I apologize. Sorry, operator, can everyone hear me?OperatorYes, this is operator, I can hear you.Allen Joseph PalmiereOkay. It was cutting out for some reason. Thanks, Kim, and I apologize, everyone. With the Back Forty Project, we remain optimistic. We made significant progress on the feasibility study. We've completed the mine and mill design as well as the site infrastructure layout that addressed previously raised environmental concerns. The initial capital and operating cost estimates were influenced by inflation and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 and resulted in higher costs than we felt were acceptable. We made a decision to slow down work on the study to evaluate alternative mining approaches and process flow sheets as well as site infrastructure layouts, all in an effort to reduce capital and operating costs. This work has resulted in a number of potential improvements. And once the work is complete and the costs appear acceptable, we will incorporate them into the feasibility study and continue to advance the project. The timing of this work is difficult to predict as it entails a substantial amount of engineering, which we are hoping we will conclude during the first half of this year. Upon completion of the feasibility study, we will present it to our Board of Directors for a production decision prior to preparing the permit applications for submittal to state agencies. Overall, 2022 was actually quite a good year. We had many accomplishments in both Mexico and Michigan, while enduring and overcoming several challenges. As we enter 2023, we are aware that we will continue to face challenges that we are prepared to handle and have already started to realize improvements. This is made possible by the strength of the team in place, which is unusual for a company of our size. Our focus has been and remains, first off, to maximize value in Mexico as is evidenced by our commitment to exploration and the results are beginning to show that, as evidenced by Tuesday's press release, we are having some encouraging intersections. We will continue to share these results as they become available. We remain focused on engineering productivity improvements to offset the impacts of inflation to improve the overall economics of the Don David Gold Mine and the Back Forty Project. While we have multiple potential opportunities, it's premature to talk about specifics, However, initial results are encouraging. Our target for 2023 is to beat guidance while expanding our resource and advancing accretive growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Allen, there is no question at this time. Please proceed with your closing remarks.Allen Joseph PalmiereWell, I'm a little bit surprised. I will say that we try to be reasonably comprehensive in our formal remarks. If, in fact, anybody does have questions, we can always deal with them in person or over a specific phone call in the future. I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I wish you all a good day. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.]"

In the post, he echoed the statements of Andy Schectman, president of precious metals investment firm Miles Franklin, sharing, “Andy Scheckman says: ‘Silver is the most undervalued asset of a generation.’ I agree.”In another one of his tweets in 2022, as reported by Benzinga, Kiyosaki shared how he put his beliefs in silver into action, saying, “To profit from the crash of US $ I bought many more US silver Buffalo rounds. Silver is a bargain.” The financial whiz has been adamant that the global economy is on the verge of a massive downturn and has been all but pleading with people to put their money into the precious metal as well. “I still believe gold, silver, Bitcoin [are] best for unstable times,” he has said.One person who’d agree with him is Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, who believes precious metals are not only valuable investments, lucrative for retirees who divert their savings into silver and gold. As he told GOBankingRates, it’s a safe option to boost earnings while the country grapples with ongoing economic windfalls.“The U.S. hitting its debt ceiling of $31.4 trillion is one of a very long list of issues contributing to a lack of faith in our country’s economy […] If the federal government defaults on its loans, that would destroy whatever investor faith might be left in the U.S. dollar causing it to weaken dramatically,” said Rose.“But when we have rampant inflation, amongst other issues, gold and silver are very attractive as a safe haven asset. These assets perform consistently in the long-term,” he added, pointing to the example of the last recession in 2008 when “gold [increased] in value almost 300% and silver 400% in just over three years.”Story continuesRose started his career working for Prudential Securities, Morgan Stanley and the London metal exchange in England, but stated that he “always believed in having something tangible” to invest in. So when he moved to the U.S. in 1997, he became involved with gold (as well as working as a financial consultant and commodities trader) and was moved to Genesis Gold Group after seeing the interest grow in precious metals.More: Automatic 401(k) Enrollment Could Be Coming Soon“With what’s happening in the world today, people are interested in learning more about gold or protecting their retirement accounts whether IRAs or 401(k)s,” he said, suggesting gold and even silver are great ways to provide that barrier. “There’s a lot more stability in having something tangible than having fear currency.”How it works, Rose explained, is “if you have a retirement account, the IRS lets you roll over your IRA or 401(k) into a precious metals IRA so it’s still an IRA, you still get your statements. The only difference is you have physical gold and silver that’s held at a licensed depository backed by major exchanges with your name on it so to speak.”Precious metals work in self-directed IRAs (one in which you manage yourself rather than working with a broker, for example). As Rose explained, “People invest real estate in self-directed IRAs, or mineral or oil rights and crypto currencies. There’s also equities they can still invest in this way, self-directed accounts just gives them a lot more control.”Per the IRS, you can generally do one tax-free rollover every year so there’s also safety in the fact that you can change in and out of investments at any time, including precious metals. “So you can roll it into gold and hold onto it for one year or three to five years (we recommend gold as a long-term hold anyway) and then roll it back into equities, whatever you want it to be invested in.”Rose likened the growing interest in gold commodities to the rise of bitcoin the past few years for anyone on the fence about this strategy — it’s just one more unique way to diversify your portfolio.“The past five years, bitcoin was the new gold with everyone touting it as the next generation of investments. I believe there’s space for that and bitcoin is here to stay, but it definitely wasn’t the new gold because a lot of these cryptos have lost 70% of their value and people that actually put cryptos in their IRAs and 401(k)s have lost substantial amounts of money,” he said. “But now people are coming back to the realization that gold is still going to shine and it’s still always going to be a stored value. That’s the thing with gold, it’s got a track record that’s been seen since the dawn of civilization. Whole worlds have been created and fallen on it. It’s not going anywhere.”And when you’re ready to take distributions, it’s pretty simple, said Rose. “It’s one of the things I love about precious metals IRAs. If you have an IRA and take RMDs (required minimum distributions), you can actually liquidate the gold or silver and take the cash value and receive the cash or actually take possession of the metals at that point. That’s something 90-95% of our clients do who are retired or retiring. Rather than cash it out, unless they need the money, they want to take possession of the metal and hold on to it and store it. It’s very simple to liquidate.”Retirement Planning: Average 401(k) Balances Fell 20% in 2022 — Will It Be a Trend?See: 67% of Americans Haven’t Taken This Key Retirement Step — Have You?Rose does caution that, like any other investment, the value of gold goes up and down and should be seen as a long-term option. “We are not day traders. We have a saying: ‘You don’t wait to buy gold, you buy gold and wait.’ So if you’re looking to buy gold and sell it in a month or six months or a year, I’d say gold isn’t for you. It’s really a long-term hold and should be looked at that way. If you look at gold and silver over the past five years, it’s increased 35-40%. And based on what we are seeing, we are very bullish on gold, it looks to repeat those numbers again.”More From GOBankingRates10 US Real Estate Markets To Avoid for NowFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tipsTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Robert Kiyosaki Says This Precious Metal Is ‘Most Undervalued Asset of a Generation’ ]"

(NYSE:NRG) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nrg-energy-inc-nyse-nrg-130508969.html,1678021508,STORY,['NRG'],"[NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$42.45 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$31.03. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NRG Energy's current trading price of US$33.64 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NRG Energy’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for NRG Energy Is NRG Energy Still Cheap?Great news for investors – NRG Energy is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 6.33x is currently well-below the industry average of 19.06x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Another thing to keep in mind is that NRG Energy’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will NRG Energy generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NRG Energy's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 22%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NRG is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NRG for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NRG. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed assessment.If you'd like to know more about NRG Energy as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.More and more data points are now indicating an imminent recession in 2023 as the Federal Reserve’s consistent rate hikes didn’t do any quick wonders to stop inflation or slow down the labor market. In this backdrop, investors are eager to invest in stocks that have low volatility, pay dividends and have long-term growth potential. Industrial stocks may give some refuge to investors in this scenario.According to a report by Fidelity, the industrial sector volatility is among the lowest on record over the past few years. The report made a comparison of the equity market sector volatility (15%) with the volatility of several sectors in the market by tracking top 3,000 U.S. stocks as measured by market capitalization. The comparison data, which spans close to two decades, shows that the volatility of the industrials sector is 18%, compared to the 15% market average. The sector fares better than energy, IT, materials, real estate, consumer discretionary and several other sectors. Only three sectors were better than industrials when it comes to volatility: utilities, healthcare and consumer staples.However, the industrials sector is closely linked to the broader economic cycles. When the economy is thriving and demand is strong, industrials tend to perform better. In a report published in June 2022, Edward Jones said that some of the key growth drivers for the industrial sector are construction and infrastructure investment, manufacturing, increasing regulation for energy and fuel efficiency, growth in China, India, Russia, Brazil and the rising middle class.Some major industrial stocks gaining attention this year include Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Story continuesMost Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Remy Gieling on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked the most popular industrial stocks among these hedge funds which have PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 26.Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Canadian logistics and transportation company TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier in February, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.72, missing estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 8.4% on a YoY basis to $1.96 billion, missing estimates by $110 million. Despite the earnings miss, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) rose amid speculation about the company’s acquisition interest in ArcBest Corp after it was revealed that TFI now owns a 4% stake in ArcBest Corp.12. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Home construction and improvement products maker Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Sell recently. The bank said that Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has provided a “reasonably achievable” guidance for 2023. The bank believes the underperformance of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) when compared to its peers justifies an upgrade.Recently, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) also upped its quarterly dividend by 1.8%.For full-year 2023, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) expects its adjusted EPS to come in between $3.10 to $3.40, less than the consensus estimate of $3.64.  Deutsche Bank's estimate was $3.30.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we added one new position—Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products. We believe the market is failing to properly reward the company’s significant upgrades in its product offerings over the past decade. During this time, management has sold off the company’s more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation and windows and cabinets, and now Masco focuses its efforts on some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products—primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)—are more resilient, lower cost and higher margin categories. Both product segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit solid pricing power, and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair-andremodel markets. Despite this greatly improved business mix, Masco trades at a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity for us to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”11. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Logistics and freight forwarding company Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

(NYSE:CNHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Shares of Italian-American industrials company CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) have gained about 15% over the past 12 months. Still, CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) presents an attractive entry point to investors. Its PE ratio stands at 12.87 as of February 26.

CNH Industrial is the second largest global agricultural equipment company (primarily tractors and combines) with leading brands Case IH and New Holland. The company reported top-line growth of 23.9% in the quarter, which was meaningfully ahead of expectations, and shares rallied on the news. After a long period of relatively stagnant technological developments in the agricultural field, CNH is on a journey to meaningfully expand their technological offerings in areas such as precision agriculture and autonomous technology. Our research indicates that the fleet of agricultural equipment in the world is as old as it has ever been going back 40 years, meaning there is pent-up demand at a time when there is new technological innovation. We believe this sets up CNH for a long-term secular growth opportunity. Last, in our view, additional internal catalysts—a new CEO who previously led an impressive turnaround at Polaris, greater pricing discipline and improvements to its supply chain efficiency—will enable it to narrow its margin gap with competitor John Deere in the periods ahead.”8.

The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”7.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Analysts.Gold price has been in a seesaw mode as investors continue to weigh and predict the next move of the Federal Reserve in light of fresh data that shows the continuing strength of the US labor market, stubborn inflation and strong consumer spending. The safe-haven asset hardly loses its shine no matter what the market environment is. A CNBC report in January quoted Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, who said in a note that gold price has seen a boost amid the reopening of China. The analyst noted the People’s Bank of China’s announcement that it bought 62 tons of gold during the last two months of the year. In this backdrop, gold stocks like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) have been gaining attention.An ""Outrageous"" Prediction About GoldHansen is making headlines for his “outrageous” prediction that gold price will hit $3,000 in 2023. The analyst thinks inflation is here to stay and gold price will receive a huge boost from a variety of reasons including geopolitical tensions and demand from China. Here is how the analyst explains his rationale:“In 2023, the hardest of currencies receives a further blast of support from three directions. First, the geopolitical backdrop of an increasing war economy mentality of self reliance and minimizing holdings of foreign FX reserves, preferring gold. Second, the massive investment in new national security priorities, including energy sources, the energy transition, and supply chains. Third, rising global liquidity as policy makers move to avoid a debacle in debt markets as a mild real  growth recession (certainly not in nominal prices, however!) takes hold. Gold slices through the double top near USD 2,075 as if it wasn’t there and hurtles to at least USD 3,000 next year.”Story continuesThe report also quoted David Neuhauser, founder and chief investment officer at Livermore Partners, who told CNBC in an interview that he expects gold to gain on the current momentum. Here’s what the analyst said:“I think as you look forward, you start to look around and think ‘where is the safest place for your investment in terms of assets?’ and the only place really to go as an alternative now is gold, in terms of knowing that you are not going to see that debasement of your assets.”Most Promising Gold Stocks According to AnalystsOur MethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify gold stocks whose average analyst price estimates are at least 20% higher than their current levels as of February 21.

SSR Mining’s stock has fallen significantly this year due to lower precious metal prices and the temporary closure of its Copler mine. We repurchased its shares in late September after the Copler mine restarted on schedule, since the stock remained depressed. SSR Mining should generate significant free cash flow at current gold and silver prices and has a very strong balance sheet with over $600 million in net cash and $4.1 billion in stockholders’ equity.

But now they are also demanding the resignation of President Dina Boluarte following protests that left dozens dead.Residents of Espinar and Chumbivilcas provinces agreed to the strike in the Cusco region on Monday and from Tuesday will resume the blockade of the ""mining corridor"", used by Chinese MMG Ltd's Las Bambas, Glencore's Antapaccay and Hubbay Minerals's Constancia mines.""We are supporting the protest against the government,"" said the coordinator of the communities in the Antapaccay area of influence in the province of Espinar, Flavio Huanque.According to the Espinar agreement document, seen by Reuters, the communities also agreed to demand the stoppage from Monday of operations at Antapaccay, Las Bambas and Constancia.""That is the agreement, from Monday we start the regional strike and we are going to block the highway,"" Carlos Quispe, one of the leaders of the defense front of the province of Chumbivilcas, told Reuters.Reuters reported this week that large mining companies in the Peruvian Andes were seeking to resume their production gradually after the corridor was unblocked, despite the climate of uncertainty and social upheaval.Las Bambas, which produces 2% of the world's copper and began operating in 2016, has largely withstood the constant stoppages, while the Antapaccay deposit suffered in January the burning of part of its camp after an attack by protesters and is still in the process of reopening.

She landed a 900 and back-to-back 720s. Canadian Rachael Karker took bronze.“It’s unbelievable,” Faulhaber said, according to U.S. Ski and Snowboard. “I’m really at a loss of words right now. I shed a couple tears, and wow.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) shareholders have enjoyed a 84% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 40% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 13% , including dividends .The past week has proven to be lucrative for PulteGroup investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for PulteGroup In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, PulteGroup achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 51% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 4.79.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how PulteGroup has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of PulteGroup, it has a TSR of 96% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that PulteGroup has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 13% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 14% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for PulteGroup (2 don't sit too well with us)  that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

An inflation shock took hold, driving the annualized inflation rate from 1.4% in January 2021 to 7% to close out the year. Moreover, the recently released inflation data suggest that inflation will continue to weigh down the economy for the better half of 2023. Therefore, I wouldn’t blame investors for looking at some of the best stocks to buy to battle what could be yet another inflation shock this year.Perhaps the best action for investors is to increase exposure to safer bets and diversify their holdings. The top sectors to invest in during periods of high inflation typically include real estate, energy, and commodities. You could throw in high-quality tech stocks that have held up well during economic downturns. Additionally, wagering on dividend stocks with a healthy track record of payouts won’t hurt either.Let’s look at some of the best inflation stocks to buy, keeping the above in mind.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsENBEnbridge$37.52MSFTMicrosoft$249.42FCXFreeport-McMoran$40.97JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$153.26NOBLS&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF$90.71PRUPrudential$100.00ORealty Income$63.95Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCanada-based Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is one of the most famous traditional energy stocks. The energy infrastructure giant operates oil and natural gas pipelines, transporting more than 25% of the total crude oil production in the North American region. Moreover, its fee-based business model has allowed the firm to build its colossal cash war chest of over $1.1 billion.The firm benefitted from higher oil and gas prices for the better part of last year, helping it post double-digit top-line growth. Following the slowdown in energy prices, it stumbled in the third quarter of 2022, but returned to generating big bucks last quarter.Story continuesMoreover, it is among the highest dividend-yielding real asset stocks, offering an excellent 7% yield. On top of that, its stock trades at just 2-times forward sales estimates, roughly 16% lower than its 5-year average. The momentum in its stock price has slowed significantly of late, which points to an excellent opportunity to load up on this stock now.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of the most popular tech businesses ever, and is arguably more relevant than ever. With its investments in AI behemoth ChatGPT, and its move to acquire video gaming giant Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), the firm is set to add new chapters to its impressive growth story. Additionally, the massive potential of these business moves hasn’t been fully priced-in, meaning I expect MSFT stock to continue to surge to new heights this year.I believe that the incredible success story that is its Azure cloud division is often underappreciated. Revenues from the segment have grown at a double-digit rate over the past several quarters and have helped effectively balance the sluggishness of its other divisions.Moreover, MSFT Stock has been a remarkable wealth compounder, generating over 750% returns in the past decade. Its record of shareholder wealth creation is as impressive as it gets, having returned over $26.5 billion via share buybacks in the past year alone.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comLeading copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has taken investors on a turbulent ride over the past few years. Its ill-advised foray into the oil and gas sector in 2013 led to the stock shedding over 50% of its value. However, it has returned its attention to copper, establishing itself as the top producer in the niche. Also, the firm has made substantial contributions to the lucrative gold and molybdenum markets over the years.Despite a challenging market, FCX stock has a tremendous wealth compounder, growing over 300% in value over the past three years. Additionally, hedge fund activity in the stock has remained remarkably consistent in the past nine quarters, a testament to the quality of the stock.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comYou don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand why pharma giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) features on my list of stocks to bet on for those worried about an extended inflation shock. Johnson &amp; Johnson boasts a consistent track record of growing its top and bottom lines from its blockbuster lineup of drugs. More importantly, for investors, it’s paid a dividend in the past 60 consecutive years, no small feat.If you’re looking for a wealth compounder, though, JNJ stock wouldn’t be your cup of tea. In its defense, the stock has offered a considerable 18% price return over the past five years. However, its strength lies in the stability of its business, having generated stellar profitability and cash flow growth over the past several years.Despite the current inflationary pressures, JNJ stock has generated a trailing twelve-month free cash flow yield of over 20% and a return on equity of around 23.5%. Therefore, it represents an excellent hedge against inflation.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL)Three wood blocks spelling out ""ETF"". representing best etfsSource: ShutterstockPicking individual stocks carries a significantly higher risk than investing in a diversified basket. Hence, for many investors, it may be more apt to wager on exchange-traded funds (ETFs).The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL) is arguably one of the best-performing ETFs, offering exposure to 64 top-tier businesses with dividend aristocrat status. These companies have successfully grown their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Additionally, NOBL stock has had an excellent record of increasing investor returns, offering a 5-year return of 58% compared to 17.2% (Median of all ETFs).Naturally, these businesses aren’t speculative bets, as they have effectively increased earnings in line with inflation and other macroeconomic pressures. The companies held in this ETF have the potential to dampen the effect of inflation on their businesses by passing along higher costs to the consumer.Prudential (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential (NYSE:PRU) is an excellent choice for long-term investors, offering a healthy balance between stability and growth. With over 140 years in the insurance space, it has proven resilient in the face of multiple economic downturns, while expanding its reach to become one of the leading life insurers worldwide. Having operations in more than 40 countries gives Prudential the scale to spread their risk across multiple geographical markets.Prudential boasts an excellent dividend portfolio offering a robust dividend yield of over 5%, with 14 consecutive years of payout growth. The company’s consistent payouts are supported by its rock-solid cash balance that continues to move from strength to strength.Its cash position soared to $1.7 billion last year, representing a massive 51% bump from its balance in 2013. The firm’s substantial cash reserves allow it to benefit from higher interest rates, as it can invest the cash generated from premiums and annuities in fixed-income instruments.Realty Income (O)Real estate agent handing over a house key, desktop with tools, wood swatches and computer on background, top view. Real estate stocks.Source: Stock-Asso / ShutterstockLike J&amp;J, Realty Income (NYSE:O) boasts an exceptional track record of paying dividends for an extended period. The firm has raised monthly dividends for over 52 years, becoming a dividend aristocrat.The popular real-estate investment trust operates one of the most consistent businesses in its niche. Much of its consistency concerns its business strategy, which revolved around purchasing properties and leasing them to tenants under long-term agreements. Consequently, its operating cash flows have grown steadily over the past several years. Moreover, its average-funds-from-operations growth has improved by 5.7% in the past three years, more than 100% higher than the sector average.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

(NYSE:WMB) For Its Next Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/might-not-great-idea-buy-121027378.html,1678018227,STORY,['WMB'],"[The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Williams Companies' shares before the 10th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.45 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.79 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Williams Companies has a trailing yield of 5.8% on the current share price of $30.97. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Williams Companies's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Williams Companies has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Last year, Williams Companies paid out 101% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (79%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Williams Companies fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Williams Companies's 8.6% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Williams Companies has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.1% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Williams Companies is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.To Sum It UpHas Williams Companies got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been in decline, which is not encouraging. Worse, Williams Companies's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow. Positive cash flows are good news but it's not a good combination. Bottom line: Williams Companies has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.So if you're still interested in Williams Companies despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Williams Companies (1 is a bit concerning) you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.According to a report by T.Rowe Price, healthcare stocks can be generally divided into two categories. The first is high-growth stocks from the life sciences and biotechnology segments. These companies are promising breakthrough therapies, have high valuations and aggressive growth models. However, investing in these stocks is not without risk and volatility. The second category comprises major pharmaceutical companies that are mature and considered as defensive plays. Earnings growth expectations for these companies are more “modest but also expected to be more consistent from quarter to quarter,” the report added. The report also gave some practical advice to investors when it comes to healthcare stocks:“If you are a disciplined long-term investor, health care stocks may be a good addition to the aggressive part of your equity portfolio. For example, of the equity portion of a well- diversified portfolio, 20% might be in health care.”The Bull Case for the US Healthcare IndustryA team of Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted the bull case for the US healthcare sector in a 2019 report. The report said that the US healthcare sector has outperformed broader markets over the past 45 years. Most importantly, the report said that the sector has outperformed during five of the last six recessions, that too by 9% on average. This makes the healthcare sector worthy of investors’ attention as we are in the middle of a recession scenario that is becoming likely by the day amid persistent inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.The Morgan Stanley report highlighted that unlike other sectors, the healthcare sector’s underperformance tends to be short-lived.The report also said that the healthcare sector in the US is undervalued relative to other defensive sectors. The sector, according to the report,  trades at a 17% discount to the average of staples and utilities forward P/E ratios.Story continuesMost Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds’ holdings and picked top 13 healthcare stocks with PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 22 with highest number of hedge fund investors. The idea was the pick the most favorite undervalued healthcare stocks of elite hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:MRVI) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The biggest stakeholder of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) out of these funds was Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP which had a $39 million stake in the firm.In Q4, Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI)’s EPS came in at $0.35, surpassing estimates by $0.01. Revenue however fell 10.4% on a YoY basis to $204.7 million, missing estimates by $0.25 million.12. QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33California-based QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) makes diagnostics products. Recently, QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) posted strong Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.76, beating estimates by $0.34. Revenue in the period jumped about 36% on a YoY basis to reach $866.5 million, beating estimates by $90.69 million.QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) said that for 2023 it expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.00-$5.60. The consensus estimate for this figure was $5.19. Revenue was expected to come in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, versus the consensus estimate of $2.81 billion. QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) said that it expects to deliver high-single-digit top-line growth over the long term.A total of 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes was $720 million. The biggest stakeholder of QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) during this period wasMeridian Funds made the following comment about QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) is a global leader in the diagnostics industry. The merger of Quidel and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics has resulted in a top 10 player in the in-vitro diagnostics industry, combining Quidel’s strong point of care platform with Ortho’s blood chemistry and transfusion platform. We believe the new company will be much more consistent in its ability to deliver steady top-line growth at attractive margins to fuel free cash flow growth. Further boosting our conviction in QuidelOrtho is its robust product pipeline. Pipeline developments include the company’s Savanna platform, which solves a long-term need for near-patient molecular testing that is accurate, fast, and economical. We believe the stock weakness is due to the anticipated decline in COVID-19 testing. However, we believe the long-term earnings and free cash flow profile are underappreciated, and as a result we increased our position in the stock.”11. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) saw a jump in hedge fund sentiment during the fourth quarter, as Insider Monkey’s propritery database of 943 hedge fund holdings shows that 34 hedge funds ended the fourth quarter with BNTX in their portfolios, compared with 18 hedge funds in the previous quarter.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”10. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is known for its kidney dialysis services.

Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $317 million.Some other notable stocks hedge funds are piling into from the healthcare sector include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA). Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)9.

50,cb26b683-7d6d-32d9-a5cf-9946eaa2efb0,TEL,2023-03-05,Has TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/te-connectivity-ltd-nyse-tel-145916971.html,1677941956,STORY,['TEL'],"[TE Connectivity's (NYSE:TEL) stock is up by 4.0% over the past week. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study TE Connectivity's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TE Connectivity is:20% = US$2.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.20 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.TE Connectivity's Earnings Growth And 20% ROETo start with, TE Connectivity's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Yet, TE Connectivity has posted measly growth of 3.9% over the past five years. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that TE Connectivity's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 18% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about TE Connectivity's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is TE Connectivity Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 28% (or a retention ratio of 72% over the past three years, TE Connectivity has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.In addition, TE Connectivity has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 27%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that TE Connectivity's future ROE will be 20% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like TE Connectivity has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.More and more data points are now indicating an imminent recession in 2023 as the Federal Reserve’s consistent rate hikes didn’t do any quick wonders to stop inflation or slow down the labor market. In this backdrop, investors are eager to invest in stocks that have low volatility, pay dividends and have long-term growth potential. Industrial stocks may give some refuge to investors in this scenario.According to a report by Fidelity, the industrial sector volatility is among the lowest on record over the past few years. The report made a comparison of the equity market sector volatility (15%) with the volatility of several sectors in the market by tracking top 3,000 U.S. stocks as measured by market capitalization. The comparison data, which spans close to two decades, shows that the volatility of the industrials sector is 18%, compared to the 15% market average. The sector fares better than energy, IT, materials, real estate, consumer discretionary and several other sectors. Only three sectors were better than industrials when it comes to volatility: utilities, healthcare and consumer staples.However, the industrials sector is closely linked to the broader economic cycles. When the economy is thriving and demand is strong, industrials tend to perform better. In a report published in June 2022, Edward Jones said that some of the key growth drivers for the industrial sector are construction and infrastructure investment, manufacturing, increasing regulation for energy and fuel efficiency, growth in China, India, Russia, Brazil and the rising middle class.Some major industrial stocks gaining attention this year include Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Story continuesMost Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Remy Gieling on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked the most popular industrial stocks among these hedge funds which have PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 26.Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Canadian logistics and transportation company TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier in February, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.72, missing estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 8.4% on a YoY basis to $1.96 billion, missing estimates by $110 million. Despite the earnings miss, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) rose amid speculation about the company’s acquisition interest in ArcBest Corp after it was revealed that TFI now owns a 4% stake in ArcBest Corp.12. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Home construction and improvement products maker Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Sell recently. The bank said that Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has provided a “reasonably achievable” guidance for 2023. The bank believes the underperformance of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) when compared to its peers justifies an upgrade.Recently, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) also upped its quarterly dividend by 1.8%.For full-year 2023, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) expects its adjusted EPS to come in between $3.10 to $3.40, less than the consensus estimate of $3.64.  Deutsche Bank's estimate was $3.30.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we added one new position—Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products. We believe the market is failing to properly reward the company’s significant upgrades in its product offerings over the past decade. During this time, management has sold off the company’s more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation and windows and cabinets, and now Masco focuses its efforts on some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products—primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)—are more resilient, lower cost and higher margin categories. Both product segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit solid pricing power, and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair-andremodel markets. Despite this greatly improved business mix, Masco trades at a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity for us to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”11. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Logistics and freight forwarding company Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) ranks 11th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD). The total value of these stakes was about $352 million. The biggest stakeholder of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

(NASDAQ:EXPD) among a list of companies that are expected to benefit from the reopening of China.10. Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Professional and industrial tools maker Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is one of the notable industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of the December quarter, 29 funds had stakes in Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA).Recently, Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, the same as the previous quarter. Forward dividend yield came in at 2.62%. The dividend is payable on March 10 to shareholders of record as of February 23.9. CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Shares of Italian-American industrials company CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) have gained about 15% over the past 12 months. Still, CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) presents an attractive entry point to investors. Its PE ratio stands at 12.87 as of February 26. Recently, Bank of America picked the industrial stock for 2023 and said in a note that it sees more room for upside potential especially after the spinoff of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)’s on-highway business.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 37 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) during this period was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company. The second biggest stakeholder of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) was John Smith Clark’s Southpoint Capital Advisors which has a $241 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI), Lattice Semiconductor and Ingersoll Rand. CNH Industrial is the second largest global agricultural equipment company (primarily tractors and combines) with leading brands Case IH and New Holland. The company reported top-line growth of 23.9% in the quarter, which was meaningfully ahead of expectations, and shares rallied on the news. After a long period of relatively stagnant technological developments in the agricultural field, CNH is on a journey to meaningfully expand their technological offerings in areas such as precision agriculture and autonomous technology. Our research indicates that the fleet of agricultural equipment in the world is as old as it has ever been going back 40 years, meaning there is pent-up demand at a time when there is new technological innovation. We believe this sets up CNH for a long-term secular growth opportunity. Last, in our view, additional internal catalysts—a new CEO who previously led an impressive turnaround at Polaris, greater pricing discipline and improvements to its supply chain efficiency—will enable it to narrow its margin gap with competitor John Deere in the periods ahead.”8. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) falls under the integrated freight and logistics segment of the broader industrials sector. United Parcel Service, Inc.

UPS, like Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), is one of the most famous stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.In the fourth quarter, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s adjusted EPS came in at $3.62, beating estimates by $0.03. Revenue in the quarter fell 2.7% on a YoY basis to $27 billion, missing estimates by $10.3 billion.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”7.

That company sued Fox in 2021 for $1.6 billion over false claims by Fox hosts during the 2020 election that Dominion helped Joe Biden win a fraudulent election over Donald Trump.The case is currently in its early stages, when the court reviews evidence to decide whether it can rule in favor of a party without a trial. Arguments are currently scheduled to begin April 17.But after weeks of damning public evidence against Fox, including texts and emails that implicate on-air personalities as well as top executives, legal experts say there has rarely been such a clear-cut path to victory for a plaintiff in a high-profile defamation case. Even without going to trial, the case could have long-lasting ramifications for Fox News’ remaining credibility, and much of the legwork may have been done by Fox itself.“This case sets forth more evidence of knowing falsity than most experts in the area are accustomed to seeing in a major media case,” RonNell Andersen Jones, a University of Utah media law professor, told Fortune.Last month, Dominion made public in a Delaware court filing a remarkable series of internal exchanges involving Fox personalities. Dominion claims the released messages reveal that star on-air broadcasters including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham, as well Fox co-founder Rupert Murdoch, did not believe the claims of election fraud in 2020 that they or their network was peddling at the time.Story continuesDuring a deposition in which Murdoch was asked under oath whether the Fox anchors had endorsed Trump’s stolen election claims, the executive acknowledged they had, the New York Times reported this week.“I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight,” he replied.But Murdoch rejected accusations that Fox News, as a whole, endorsed Donald Trump’s stolen election claims and seemingly distanced himself and the Fox Corporation from the anchors’ statements. When asked if the company at large endorsed the narratives, he responded: “Not Fox. No. Not Fox.”Legal experts say Murdoch may try to divert some of the blame for the fraudulent statements away from the company and onto the hosts.“I would guess that there are more than a few people who might suspect that Fox News would try to deflect, and would maybe try to find scapegoats,” Joseph Russomanno, an Arizona State University media law professor, told Fortune.“A lot of what we saw in Rupert Murdoch's comments seem to be his attempt to protect the brand of Fox News, to protect the company, and to protect himself while pointing the finger of blame at others,” he added.Russomanno said the recent evidence, particularly Murdoch’s comments may even suggest that “Fox News is going a long way in helping Dominion prove its case in terms of what has been revealed.” He called it “unusual, if not unprecedented.”Lie or opinion?The foundation of Fox’s defense is that the network was reporting on newsworthy claims of election fraud made by Trump, and that biased reporting is protected by the First Amendment.Fox’s position is that Dominion’s legal interpretation would “prevent journalists from basic reporting,” a Fox spokesperson told Fortune. “According to Dominion, the press is liable for reporting newsworthy allegations made by the sitting President of the United States even if the press makes clear that the allegations are unproven and that many people contest them.”Dominion has rejected Fox’s defense, arguing that the First Amendment does not apply in this situation. “Dominion is a strong believer in the First Amendment and its protections. As long-settled law makes clear, the First Amendment does not shield broadcasters that knowingly or recklessly spread lies,” a company spokesperson told Fortune.The issue for Fox is if the plaintiffs can prove the network knew at the time that its statements were false, which would make it a much easier case for Dominion to argue.“The really important thing to understand is Fox has got a right to be biased,” David Korzenik, a lawyer who specializes in media law and the First Amendment, told Fortune. But he added, “It doesn't have a right to publish things that it knows to be false or believes to be false.”The case will likely come down to whether Dominion can prove Fox published false statements with “actual malice,” a precedent established in the 1964 case New York Times v. Sullivan. It requires “public figures” in defamation suits to prove the defendants made statements with “knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”In most defamation cases, plaintiffs typically argue the precedent’s second part—that an accused party acted with disregard of the truth, according to Arizona State’s Russomanno. But the Fox case stands out because of the evidence that lets Dominion argue for the former—that Fox’s hosts were fully aware they were publishing lies.“In this situation, it is becoming clear through the testimony of Fox itself they knew the information was false and then moved forward and published it,” he said.Contain the fireAccusations of defamation and incriminating testimonies have already boosted Dominion’s chances of a successful suit against Fox, but the network’s brand and credibility may have already suffered even without a judge’s ruling.“[Dominion] has surely succeeded in drawing attention to the behind-the-scenes scramble that happened at Fox News in the aftermath of the election. In that sense, Fox has already lost on some important fronts,” said the University of Utah’s Andersen Jones. She added that the suit has already raised questions as to how far Fox went in perpetuating election denial claims in comments made to its own audience.“That may itself carry ramifications for the brand. It probably also produces pressure to settle, to avoid even more exposure of this material at a trial,” she said.Damage to Fox News’ brand and credibility may not do much to turn away its core viewership, which has long been considered more loyal than audiences of other channels, although some viewers may well be deterred from tuning in as often.“I think there's a good amount of the viewing population that simply doesn't care about lies, as long as they’re pro-Trump lies,” Richard Painter, a law professor who served as the White House’s chief ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, told Fortune. “But I don't think they're going to hold the larger audience. I think they're going to lose a good portion of the conservative but moderate group.”A ruling against Fox could lead to an organizational reshuffling and shareholder blowback, Jeffrey Sonnenfield, the senior associate dean of leadership studies at Yale University who has spent four decades advising CEOs and U.S. presidents on leadership, told CNN this week.“The board has a duty to remove such officials for proven misconduct,” he said, referring to executives such as Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott. He added that Fox could expect shareholder lawsuits, loss of insurance protections, and even an SEC investigation for “deceptive practices of the board for conspiring to conceal known misconduct.”Fox News, which accounts for most of the Fox Corporation’s revenue, has long been accused of excessively focusing on sustaining its viewership to maintain profits and to increase shareholder returns, something that may have contributed to its election denialism and may hurt the network’s credibility in the long run, according to Painter.“I think they're going to lose that credibility very quickly if they don't categorically reject shareholder primacy,” Painter said. “They could destroy their business model to the detriment of the shareholders, which is the great irony.”What happens next for Fox depends on whether Dominion can prove actual malice, if executives like Murdoch are found to be at fault as well as the hosts, and how Fox reacts. But in many ways, some damage to Fox may have already been done.“This is a defense of containment on how to contain the fire. I don't think it’s overall likely to prevent Dominion from landing a punch,” Korzenik said. “They may do some containment but they're not going to stop the fist from landing.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

But don’t take my word for it; listen to the CEO of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, who told CNBC on Feb. 23 that “The U.S. economy is doing quite well. Consumers have a lot of money, and they’re spending it.” Indeed, The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 24, “Spending by U.S. households rose a seasonally adjusted 1.8% in January from the prior month, the largest increase in nearly two years.” In that environment, it’s not surprising that many companies, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), have recently reported solid results, propelling their stocks significantly higher. And given that most companies’ businesses, directly or indirectly, are based on consumer spending, many other firms are likely to report very strong financial results om the current environment, greatly boosting their stocks. Given those points, investors should look for stocks to buy on weakness.These seven names, which all have strong fundamentals and benefit from powerful, ongoing trends that should last indefinitely, are great stocks to buy on the dip.TickerCompanyPricePYPLPayPal$74.10TRIPTripAdvisor$21.58CATCaterpillar$247.49ARVLArrival$0.27SEDGSolarEdge$328.64BNGOBionano$1.29VWAGYVolkswagen$17.82InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported very strong fourth-quarter results, showing that my bullish thesis on the company remains intact.Specifically, as I’ve stated in the past, I think that the company has a firm position in the digital payments market and that it is likely to continue to maintain that position over time. And, of course, the digital payments sector continues to grow rapidly.Story continuesMeanwhile, activist investor Elliott Management, which has acquired a $2 billion stake in PayPal, should have a significant, positive impact on PayPal and PYPL stock. In my experience, activist investors do tend to find ways to boost their targets’ stocks. Moreover, CNBC reports that “Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor, particularly in the technology sector.Regarding the Q4 results, PayPal’s revenue jumped 10% year-over-year, excluding currency fluctuations, while its free cash flow climbed 4% YOY to $5.1 billion.Also noteworthy is that PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, who’s due to leave the position at the end of this year, recently bought over 26,065 shares of PYPL stock.The shares have tumbled 10.5% over the month that ended on Feb. 23.TripAdvisor (TRIP)The TripAdvisor logo representing LTRPA and LTRPB Stock.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comBenefiting from the travel boom, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) reported very strong fourth-quarter results. The company’s revenue jumped 47% versus the same period a year earlier, and its EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared 50% YOY to $43 million. The company’s Q4 revenue was 6% higher than in Q4 of 2019. Moreover, despite high inflation, TRIP’s margins rose in 2022 versus 2021.The company should benefit as the trend of more consumers booking their vacations online instead of offline continues, and TRIP plans to increase its monetization of experiences, the company’s CEO, Jane Jie Sun, said on its fourth-quarter earnings conference call.TRIP’s cash rose nearly $300 million year-over-year to $1.02 billion.After sinking 8% in the last month, TRIP has an attractive price-earnings ratio of 16.7. Last quarter, institutions bought or held nearly 90 million shares of TRIP stock and only sold 13.3 million shares of the name, according to Nasdaq.com.Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT), a huge construction-equipment and mining-equipment maker, is well-positioned to benefit from multiple, powerful trends, and it reported outstanding fourth-quarter results in January. Moreover, the valuation of CAT stock is very attractive.Among the trends likely to boost CAT going forward are Washington’s infrastructure law, the onshoring trend in general, and the construction of many semiconductor, electric-vehicle, battery, and renewable-energy plants.On the earnings front, CAT’s revenue jumped 20% year-over-year last quarter, while its Q4 earnings per share, excluding certain items, soared 43% YOY. For all of 2022, its sales jumped 17% YOY, while its bottom line increased 7% to a record of $13.84. And, most impressively and most importantly, its backlog soared 32% last year to a huge $30.4 billion.“While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, overall demand remains healthy across our segments, and we expect 2023 [to] be better than 2022 on both top and bottom line,” CAT CEO James Umpleby III stated on the company’s Q4 earnings call.CAT stock has a low forward price-earnings ratio of just 15, while the shares slipped 7% between Jan. 27 and Feb. 24. Given all of CAT’s positive attributes and its recent pullback, it is a great stock to buy on weakness.Arrival (ARVL)Person holding cellphone with webpage of electric vehicle manufacturer Arrival Ltd (ARVL) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comShowing a significant amount of faith in beleaguered automaker Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL), Antara Capital Master Fund LP agreed to buy up to $50 million of ARVL stock.The deal dramatically lowers the chances of ARVL going bankrupt and tremendously raises the chances of the automaker becoming successful. That’s because the agreement cuts ARVL’s debt by nearly $122 million, or 38%. Moreover, even Seeking Alpha contributor Mobility Matters Research, who’s extremely bearish on Arrival, calculates that the automaker’s current cash will hold up until the firm is slated to begin production in 2024.Predictably, much if not most of the Street, which tends to focus on quantitative measures and ignore much more important quantitative ones, is, like Mobility Matters, quite pessimistic about ARVL.But most of the same types were also sure that JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) would all go bankrupt at one point or another over the last ten years. And all four of those firms are very much surviving and thriving today. At the same time, they all rewarded their shareholders quite handsomely before the Street soured on growth stocks starting in 2021 because of higher inflation and the Fed’s interest rate hikes. (In line with my previous predictions, the Street is finally starting to see the folly of that view this year).In Arrival’s case, its crucial, quantitative, positive catalysts include its partnerships with UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) and the huge demand for electric delivery vehicles.After tumbling 91% over the last year and 28% in the last month, ARVL stock has a market capitalization of just $187 million, vastly understating its outlook.SolarEdge (SEDG)the solar edge logo on an iPhone. SEDG stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comThe Street has turned bearish on solar because of its worries about California’s decision to reduce the amount of money it pays its residents for the energy its solar panels send to the grid. Partly because of that fear, the shares of SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), which makes solar inverters, tumbled 44% from Feb. 15 to Feb. 24.However, the outlook for solar energy in both the U.S. and Europe, SolarEdge’s two largest markets, is robust. Both markets’ solar energy utilization is expected to jump tremendously this year.In the U.S., America’s Energy Information Administration recently forecasted that “54.5 GW of total capacity is expected to come online this year,” up from just 10.3 gigawatts last year.And in Europe, there will be over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity linked to the grid in the EU after the bloc’s solar activations jumped 47% in 2022 to 41 gigawatts.“We are confident that further annual market growth will beat all expectations, exceed 50 GW deployment level in 2023, and more than double from today to 85 GW in 2026,” SolarPower asserted.For the fourth quarter, SolarEdge’s revenue soared 61% year-over-year to a record $891 million and came in $11.6 million above analysts’ average estimate. Its operating profit, excluding certain items, was an impressive $150 million, representing an all-time high. For all of 2022, it generated a net income, excluding certain items, of $351 million.Given the company’s strong growth and solar’s positive future, its current market cap of $16.63 billion is way below its long-term outlook.Bionano (BNGO)Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the backgroundSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comStrong evidence indicates that Bionano’s (NASDAQ:BNGO) optical genome technology is tremendously useful, and its usefulness will continue to increase. In a document previously found by a YouTube broadcaster, Mr. INVEST ALOT, a Department of Paediatric Endocrinology professor at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, Paul Dimitri, explains that OGM is extremely useful and will become very widely utilized in the future.Specifically, Dimitri wrote that “Optical genome mapping (OGM)…is now recognised as key genomic technology capable of detecting of all classes of structural variants in many disorders, which will undoubtedly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis of rare disorders in children.”He added that studies have shown that OGM is superior to standard testing for detecting acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. Additionally, the professor predicted that “Given the extended capabilities of OGM, many undiagnosed conditions in [pediatric patients] will be explored using OGM.”And in more very bullish news, a recent press release from Bionano indicates that the Chinese government has become a backer of OGM and, by extension, Bionano. That’s because, on Feb. 22, Bionano announced that its Chinese partner had obtained approval from Beijing to utilize “Bionano’s DNA extraction kit and labeling products.” Of course, China is a potentially huge market for Bionano.With BNGO down 40% over the last year and its market cap sunk to $377 million, the stock is poised to surge over the long term, given the company’s extraordinarily bright future.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comVolkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) reported a net cash flow of roughly 5 billion euros last year. That was impressive but significantly below the automaker’s target of 8.6 billion euros. However, the company explained that supply-chain issues were primarily responsible for the miss. So with global supply chains generally improving meaningfully, Volkswagen’s profits should jump meaningfully this year. Also worth noting is that the automaker’s operating profit came in at a much higher 22.5 billion euros.Meanwhile, boding very well for Volkswagen’s longer-term outlook, in the third quarter of last year, its “total deliveries” climbed 10% year-over-year. In contrast, its deliveries of electric vehicles soared 25% YOY. And in Europe, where electric vehicles accounted for 24% of total vehicle sales last year, Volkswagen EV brands ranked third and fourth on the top-selling list in December, trailing only Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y.The company’s sales slipped 7% for the full year, but it was still the second-leading automaker by unit sales, behind only Toyota (NYSE:TM). What’s more, its EV sales climbed 26% in 2022.With China and the EU rapidly switching to EVs and the U.S. beginning to follow suit, Volkswagen’s future looks bright.Volkswagen has tumbled 34% in the last year, and it’s changing hands at a very cheap trailing price-earnings ratio of 5.1 while it pays a handsome dividend yield of 4.55%.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of ARVL,JKS,PLUG, BB, and BNGO.

Companies turn to AI technology for solutions as the world population grows and the agricultural industry faces challenges. By investing in agriculture AI stocks, investors can benefit from the potential of this technology and its potential returns.AI has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by making it easier to regulate the surrounding environment, providing consumers with organic food, and saving farmers a lot of time and money.AI in the agricultural industry has undergone tremendous growth due to many factors. Perhaps the most pressing reason is the shortage of skilled labor and an aging farming population. This has become an obstacle for farmers, and AI offers a plausible solution. In addition, since young people don’t find farming an interesting field of work, automated farming operations have become increasingly significant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith the growth of nations, fewer people are engaged in agricultural activities, as compared to other industries.AI solutions are becoming increasingly popular in agriculture for many reasons. There is a need for innovation and new opportunities to streamline production and improve efficiency. Robotics replace labor and do weeding, hay bailing, and seeding with exactness and productivity.In the next three decades, the world’s population is forecasted to rise from 8 billion to 9.7 billion by 2050, possibly reaching 10.4 billion by the 2080s. This surge will propel the rising demand for agricultural produce.As a result, agriculture AI stocks are expected to grow exponentially as more companies invest in this technology. The immense growth potential could result in significant profits for those who invest early on. With the right strategy, investors can capitalize on this emerging trend and reap the rewards from their investments in agriculture AI stocks.Story continuesTickerCompanyPriceMSFTMicrosoft$248.02IBMIBM$128.39AMZNAmazon$92.82Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most influential companies in the world.

The program aims to support sustainable food and regenerative agriculture across France.Danone and Microsoft will collaborate to provide a hub for AI startups in the agri-food sector. AI startups will have three months of acceleration during this collaboration, helping them develop their business infrastructure and providing a great learning experience.This program is the third series about implementing AI solutions within business situations.Whenever there is talk about Microsoft in investing circles, there is sure to be talk about its potential acquisition of Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI). There is often discussion on the future of the two companies.The all-cash transaction deal valued at $68.7 billion is subject to several regulatory hurdles. Analyst Dan Ives recently weighed in on the merger, saying he believes it will go through. In raising his per-share price target on Microsoft to $290, Ives said the software giant had seen a “steady” flow of cloud computing deals since December.Shares are up just 4.42% in 2023, making MSFT attractive among agriculture AI stocks.International Business Machines (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

These companies usually have solid track records of stable earnings growth, which indicates their financial stability. Moreover, dividend growers exhibit strong performance than their peers in times of market downturn. According to a report by Capital Group, dividend growers delivered a 9.3% return to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, representing a volatility of 14.5%. In contrast, non-dividend payers returned 4% during the same period, with a volatility of 19.7%. The report also mentioned that nearly one-third of the market’s total return came from dividend income from 1926 to 2021.Nuveen, an American asset management company, revealed that dividends represented 67% and 72% of the total return in the 1940s and the 1970s, respectively. These were the decades when inflation reached its record high in the US. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 10% growth in dividends per share in 2022 and is expected to grow by 5% in 2023.  Another report by IHS Markit shed light on the outlook of dividend stocks this year. The report mentioned that the energy, banking, and industrial goods sectors will represent roughly 40% of global dividends in 2023. Moreover, dividends in the US are expected to reach $706 billion this year, up 3% from 2022.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”7. A. O.

The company uses its earnings to consistently grow its dividends and share repurchases. Over the past three years the company’s performance has been hurt by its exposure to China as its business there suffered due to the US-China trade war and poor execution. We believe the China business is back on track and the all-important US business is doing better than ever as housing demand heats up in the US. The company beat earnings estimates over the past several quarters and is currently enjoying very good performance as the hot U.S housing market continues to be strong.19 A.O.

(NYSE:V),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-visa-inc-140029256.html,1677938429,STORY,['V'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Visa is US$203 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$224 suggests Visa is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 28% higher than Visa's analyst price target of US$260In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Visa The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$18.0bUS$20.2bUS$22.4bUS$24.3bUS$26.5bUS$28.1bUS$29.4bUS$30.6bUS$31.6bUS$32.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.03%Est @ 4.84%Est @ 4.01%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 3.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$16.7kUS$17.3kUS$17.7kUS$17.8kUS$17.9kUS$17.5kUS$17.0kUS$16.3kUS$15.6kUS$14.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$169bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$33b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$545bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$545b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$248bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$417b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$224, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Visa as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.028. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for VisaStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.More and more data points are now indicating an imminent recession in 2023 as the Federal Reserve’s consistent rate hikes didn’t do any quick wonders to stop inflation or slow down the labor market. In this backdrop, investors are eager to invest in stocks that have low volatility, pay dividends and have long-term growth potential. Industrial stocks may give some refuge to investors in this scenario.According to a report by Fidelity, the industrial sector volatility is among the lowest on record over the past few years. The report made a comparison of the equity market sector volatility (15%) with the volatility of several sectors in the market by tracking top 3,000 U.S. stocks as measured by market capitalization. The comparison data, which spans close to two decades, shows that the volatility of the industrials sector is 18%, compared to the 15% market average. The sector fares better than energy, IT, materials, real estate, consumer discretionary and several other sectors. Only three sectors were better than industrials when it comes to volatility: utilities, healthcare and consumer staples.However, the industrials sector is closely linked to the broader economic cycles. When the economy is thriving and demand is strong, industrials tend to perform better. In a report published in June 2022, Edward Jones said that some of the key growth drivers for the industrial sector are construction and infrastructure investment, manufacturing, increasing regulation for energy and fuel efficiency, growth in China, India, Russia, Brazil and the rising middle class.Some major industrial stocks gaining attention this year include Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Story continuesMost Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Remy Gieling on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked the most popular industrial stocks among these hedge funds which have PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 26.Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Canadian logistics and transportation company TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier in February, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.72, missing estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 8.4% on a YoY basis to $1.96 billion, missing estimates by $110 million. Despite the earnings miss, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) rose amid speculation about the company’s acquisition interest in ArcBest Corp after it was revealed that TFI now owns a 4% stake in ArcBest Corp.12. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Home construction and improvement products maker Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Sell recently. The bank said that Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has provided a “reasonably achievable” guidance for 2023. The bank believes the underperformance of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) when compared to its peers justifies an upgrade.Recently, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) also upped its quarterly dividend by 1.8%.For full-year 2023, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) expects its adjusted EPS to come in between $3.10 to $3.40, less than the consensus estimate of $3.64.  Deutsche Bank's estimate was $3.30.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we added one new position—Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products. We believe the market is failing to properly reward the company’s significant upgrades in its product offerings over the past decade. During this time, management has sold off the company’s more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation and windows and cabinets, and now Masco focuses its efforts on some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products—primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)—are more resilient, lower cost and higher margin categories. Both product segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit solid pricing power, and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair-andremodel markets. Despite this greatly improved business mix, Masco trades at a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity for us to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”11. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Logistics and freight forwarding company Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) ranks 11th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

(NASDAQ:EXPD) among a list of companies that are expected to benefit from the reopening of China.10. Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Professional and industrial tools maker Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is one of the notable industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of the December quarter, 29 funds had stakes in Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA).Recently, Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, the same as the previous quarter. Forward dividend yield came in at 2.62%. The dividend is payable on March 10 to shareholders of record as of February 23.9. CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Shares of Italian-American industrials company CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) have gained about 15% over the past 12 months. Still, CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) presents an attractive entry point to investors. Its PE ratio stands at 12.87 as of February 26. Recently, Bank of America picked the industrial stock for 2023 and said in a note that it sees more room for upside potential especially after the spinoff of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)’s on-highway business.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 37 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) during this period was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company. The second biggest stakeholder of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) was John Smith Clark’s Southpoint Capital Advisors which has a $241 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI), Lattice Semiconductor and Ingersoll Rand. CNH Industrial is the second largest global agricultural equipment company (primarily tractors and combines) with leading brands Case IH and New Holland. The company reported top-line growth of 23.9% in the quarter, which was meaningfully ahead of expectations, and shares rallied on the news. After a long period of relatively stagnant technological developments in the agricultural field, CNH is on a journey to meaningfully expand their technological offerings in areas such as precision agriculture and autonomous technology. Our research indicates that the fleet of agricultural equipment in the world is as old as it has ever been going back 40 years, meaning there is pent-up demand at a time when there is new technological innovation. We believe this sets up CNH for a long-term secular growth opportunity. Last, in our view, additional internal catalysts—a new CEO who previously led an impressive turnaround at Polaris, greater pricing discipline and improvements to its supply chain efficiency—will enable it to narrow its margin gap with competitor John Deere in the periods ahead.”8. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36United Parcel Service, Inc.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NVIDIA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$24b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in NVIDIA. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors.

(NYSE:APD) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$872.8m-US$516.5m-US$1.11bUS$1.96bUS$4.09bUS$5.97bUS$7.93bUS$9.80bUS$11.5bUS$12.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x13Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 45.95%Est @ 32.79%Est @ 23.57%Est @ 17.12%Est @ 12.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% -US$808-US$443-US$878US$1.4kUS$2.8kUS$3.8kUS$4.6kUS$5.3kUS$5.7kUS$6.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$221bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$221b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$102bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$130b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$295, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Air Products and Chemicals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.004. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Air Products and ChemicalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Chemicals industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

That company sued Fox in 2021 for $1.6 billion over false claims by Fox hosts during the 2020 election that Dominion helped Joe Biden win a fraudulent election over Donald Trump.The case is currently in its early stages, when the court reviews evidence to decide whether it can rule in favor of a party without a trial. Arguments are currently scheduled to begin April 17.But after weeks of damning public evidence against Fox, including texts and emails that implicate on-air personalities as well as top executives, legal experts say there has rarely been such a clear-cut path to victory for a plaintiff in a high-profile defamation case. Even without going to trial, the case could have long-lasting ramifications for Fox News’ remaining credibility, and much of the legwork may have been done by Fox itself.“This case sets forth more evidence of knowing falsity than most experts in the area are accustomed to seeing in a major media case,” RonNell Andersen Jones, a University of Utah media law professor, told Fortune.Last month, Dominion made public in a Delaware court filing a remarkable series of internal exchanges involving Fox personalities. Dominion claims the released messages reveal that star on-air broadcasters including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham, as well Fox co-founder Rupert Murdoch, did not believe the claims of election fraud in 2020 that they or their network was peddling at the time.Story continuesDuring a deposition in which Murdoch was asked under oath whether the Fox anchors had endorsed Trump’s stolen election claims, the executive acknowledged they had, the New York Times reported this week.“I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight,” he replied.But Murdoch rejected accusations that Fox News, as a whole, endorsed Donald Trump’s stolen election claims and seemingly distanced himself and the Fox Corporation from the anchors’ statements. When asked if the company at large endorsed the narratives, he responded: “Not Fox. No. Not Fox.”Legal experts say Murdoch may try to divert some of the blame for the fraudulent statements away from the company and onto the hosts.“I would guess that there are more than a few people who might suspect that Fox News would try to deflect, and would maybe try to find scapegoats,” Joseph Russomanno, an Arizona State University media law professor, told Fortune.“A lot of what we saw in Rupert Murdoch's comments seem to be his attempt to protect the brand of Fox News, to protect the company, and to protect himself while pointing the finger of blame at others,” he added.Russomanno said the recent evidence, particularly Murdoch’s comments may even suggest that “Fox News is going a long way in helping Dominion prove its case in terms of what has been revealed.” He called it “unusual, if not unprecedented.”Lie or opinion?The foundation of Fox’s defense is that the network was reporting on newsworthy claims of election fraud made by Trump, and that biased reporting is protected by the First Amendment.Fox’s position is that Dominion’s legal interpretation would “prevent journalists from basic reporting,” a Fox spokesperson told Fortune. “According to Dominion, the press is liable for reporting newsworthy allegations made by the sitting President of the United States even if the press makes clear that the allegations are unproven and that many people contest them.”Dominion has rejected Fox’s defense, arguing that the First Amendment does not apply in this situation. “Dominion is a strong believer in the First Amendment and its protections. As long-settled law makes clear, the First Amendment does not shield broadcasters that knowingly or recklessly spread lies,” a company spokesperson told Fortune.The issue for Fox is if the plaintiffs can prove the network knew at the time that its statements were false, which would make it a much easier case for Dominion to argue.“The really important thing to understand is Fox has got a right to be biased,” David Korzenik, a lawyer who specializes in media law and the First Amendment, told Fortune. But he added, “It doesn't have a right to publish things that it knows to be false or believes to be false.”The case will likely come down to whether Dominion can prove Fox published false statements with “actual malice,” a precedent established in the 1964 case New York Times v. Sullivan. It requires “public figures” in defamation suits to prove the defendants made statements with “knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”In most defamation cases, plaintiffs typically argue the precedent’s second part—that an accused party acted with disregard of the truth, according to Arizona State’s Russomanno. But the Fox case stands out because of the evidence that lets Dominion argue for the former—that Fox’s hosts were fully aware they were publishing lies.“In this situation, it is becoming clear through the testimony of Fox itself they knew the information was false and then moved forward and published it,” he said.Contain the fireAccusations of defamation and incriminating testimonies have already boosted Dominion’s chances of a successful suit against Fox, but the network’s brand and credibility may have already suffered even without a judge’s ruling.“[Dominion] has surely succeeded in drawing attention to the behind-the-scenes scramble that happened at Fox News in the aftermath of the election. In that sense, Fox has already lost on some important fronts,” said the University of Utah’s Andersen Jones. She added that the suit has already raised questions as to how far Fox went in perpetuating election denial claims in comments made to its own audience.“That may itself carry ramifications for the brand. It probably also produces pressure to settle, to avoid even more exposure of this material at a trial,” she said.Damage to Fox News’ brand and credibility may not do much to turn away its core viewership, which has long been considered more loyal than audiences of other channels, although some viewers may well be deterred from tuning in as often.“I think there's a good amount of the viewing population that simply doesn't care about lies, as long as they’re pro-Trump lies,” Richard Painter, a law professor who served as the White House’s chief ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, told Fortune. “But I don't think they're going to hold the larger audience. I think they're going to lose a good portion of the conservative but moderate group.”A ruling against Fox could lead to an organizational reshuffling and shareholder blowback, Jeffrey Sonnenfield, the senior associate dean of leadership studies at Yale University who has spent four decades advising CEOs and U.S. presidents on leadership, told CNN this week.“The board has a duty to remove such officials for proven misconduct,” he said, referring to executives such as Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott. He added that Fox could expect shareholder lawsuits, loss of insurance protections, and even an SEC investigation for “deceptive practices of the board for conspiring to conceal known misconduct.”Fox News, which accounts for most of the Fox Corporation’s revenue, has long been accused of excessively focusing on sustaining its viewership to maintain profits and to increase shareholder returns, something that may have contributed to its election denialism and may hurt the network’s credibility in the long run, according to Painter.“I think they're going to lose that credibility very quickly if they don't categorically reject shareholder primacy,” Painter said. “They could destroy their business model to the detriment of the shareholders, which is the great irony.”What happens next for Fox depends on whether Dominion can prove actual malice, if executives like Murdoch are found to be at fault as well as the hosts, and how Fox reacts. But in many ways, some damage to Fox may have already been done.“This is a defense of containment on how to contain the fire. I don't think it’s overall likely to prevent Dominion from landing a punch,” Korzenik said. “They may do some containment but they're not going to stop the fist from landing.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Cummins'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Cummins How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cummins is:21% = US$2.2b ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Cummins' Earnings Growth And 21% ROEAt first glance, Cummins seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Cummins' moderate 7.3% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Cummins' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 7.5% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is CMI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CMI is currently mispriced by the market.Is Cummins Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 40% (implying that the company retains 60% of its profits), it seems that Cummins is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Cummins is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 34%. Regardless, the future ROE for Cummins is predicted to rise to 27% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Cummins' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.37bUS$6.90bUS$9.47bUS$13.2bUS$15.9bUS$17.9bUS$19.5bUS$20.9bUS$22.1bUS$23.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x13Analyst x10Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 12.45%Est @ 9.34%Est @ 7.16%Est @ 5.63%Est @ 4.56% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$4.0kUS$5.9kUS$7.4kUS$9.5kUS$10.5kUS$10.9kUS$11.0kUS$10.8kUS$10.5kUS$10.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$91bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$23b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.1%) = US$363bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$363b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$159bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$250b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$101, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.094. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for DIS.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”7. A. O.

Smith is the largest US manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters, boilers and water treatment products. The company generates close to $3 billion in annual sales.

Approximately 80% of demand is replacing existing heaters and 20% is tied to new construction. The company continues to benefit from a shift towards higher efficiency, but more expensive, tankless heaters.A.O. Smith generates returns on invested capital in the high teens. The company uses its earnings to consistently grow its dividends and share repurchases. Over the past three years the company’s performance has been hurt by its exposure to China as its business there suffered due to the US-China trade war and poor execution. We believe the China business is back on track and the all-important US business is doing better than ever as housing demand heats up in the US. The company beat earnings estimates over the past several quarters and is currently enjoying very good performance as the hot U.S housing market continues to be strong.19 A.O.

But don’t take my word for it; listen to the CEO of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, who told CNBC on Feb. 23 that “The U.S. economy is doing quite well. Consumers have a lot of money, and they’re spending it.” Indeed, The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 24, “Spending by U.S. households rose a seasonally adjusted 1.8% in January from the prior month, the largest increase in nearly two years.” In that environment, it’s not surprising that many companies, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), have recently reported solid results, propelling their stocks significantly higher. And given that most companies’ businesses, directly or indirectly, are based on consumer spending, many other firms are likely to report very strong financial results om the current environment, greatly boosting their stocks. Given those points, investors should look for stocks to buy on weakness.These seven names, which all have strong fundamentals and benefit from powerful, ongoing trends that should last indefinitely, are great stocks to buy on the dip.TickerCompanyPricePYPLPayPal$74.10TRIPTripAdvisor$21.58CATCaterpillar$247.49ARVLArrival$0.27SEDGSolarEdge$328.64BNGOBionano$1.29VWAGYVolkswagen$17.82InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported very strong fourth-quarter results, showing that my bullish thesis on the company remains intact.Specifically, as I’ve stated in the past, I think that the company has a firm position in the digital payments market and that it is likely to continue to maintain that position over time. And, of course, the digital payments sector continues to grow rapidly.Story continuesMeanwhile, activist investor Elliott Management, which has acquired a $2 billion stake in PayPal, should have a significant, positive impact on PayPal and PYPL stock. In my experience, activist investors do tend to find ways to boost their targets’ stocks. Moreover, CNBC reports that “Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor, particularly in the technology sector.Regarding the Q4 results, PayPal’s revenue jumped 10% year-over-year, excluding currency fluctuations, while its free cash flow climbed 4% YOY to $5.1 billion.Also noteworthy is that PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, who’s due to leave the position at the end of this year, recently bought over 26,065 shares of PYPL stock.The shares have tumbled 10.5% over the month that ended on Feb. 23.TripAdvisor (TRIP)The TripAdvisor logo representing LTRPA and LTRPB Stock.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comBenefiting from the travel boom, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) reported very strong fourth-quarter results. The company’s revenue jumped 47% versus the same period a year earlier, and its EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared 50% YOY to $43 million. The company’s Q4 revenue was 6% higher than in Q4 of 2019. Moreover, despite high inflation, TRIP’s margins rose in 2022 versus 2021.The company should benefit as the trend of more consumers booking their vacations online instead of offline continues, and TRIP plans to increase its monetization of experiences, the company’s CEO, Jane Jie Sun, said on its fourth-quarter earnings conference call.TRIP’s cash rose nearly $300 million year-over-year to $1.02 billion.After sinking 8% in the last month, TRIP has an attractive price-earnings ratio of 16.7. Last quarter, institutions bought or held nearly 90 million shares of TRIP stock and only sold 13.3 million shares of the name, according to Nasdaq.com.Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT), a huge construction-equipment and mining-equipment maker, is well-positioned to benefit from multiple, powerful trends, and it reported outstanding fourth-quarter results in January. Moreover, the valuation of CAT stock is very attractive.Among the trends likely to boost CAT going forward are Washington’s infrastructure law, the onshoring trend in general, and the construction of many semiconductor, electric-vehicle, battery, and renewable-energy plants.On the earnings front, CAT’s revenue jumped 20% year-over-year last quarter, while its Q4 earnings per share, excluding certain items, soared 43% YOY. For all of 2022, its sales jumped 17% YOY, while its bottom line increased 7% to a record of $13.84. And, most impressively and most importantly, its backlog soared 32% last year to a huge $30.4 billion.“While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, overall demand remains healthy across our segments, and we expect 2023 [to] be better than 2022 on both top and bottom line,” CAT CEO James Umpleby III stated on the company’s Q4 earnings call.CAT stock has a low forward price-earnings ratio of just 15, while the shares slipped 7% between Jan. 27 and Feb. 24. Given all of CAT’s positive attributes and its recent pullback, it is a great stock to buy on weakness.Arrival (ARVL)Person holding cellphone with webpage of electric vehicle manufacturer Arrival Ltd (ARVL) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comShowing a significant amount of faith in beleaguered automaker Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL), Antara Capital Master Fund LP agreed to buy up to $50 million of ARVL stock.The deal dramatically lowers the chances of ARVL going bankrupt and tremendously raises the chances of the automaker becoming successful. That’s because the agreement cuts ARVL’s debt by nearly $122 million, or 38%. Moreover, even Seeking Alpha contributor Mobility Matters Research, who’s extremely bearish on Arrival, calculates that the automaker’s current cash will hold up until the firm is slated to begin production in 2024.Predictably, much if not most of the Street, which tends to focus on quantitative measures and ignore much more important quantitative ones, is, like Mobility Matters, quite pessimistic about ARVL.But most of the same types were also sure that JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) would all go bankrupt at one point or another over the last ten years. And all four of those firms are very much surviving and thriving today. At the same time, they all rewarded their shareholders quite handsomely before the Street soured on growth stocks starting in 2021 because of higher inflation and the Fed’s interest rate hikes. (In line with my previous predictions, the Street is finally starting to see the folly of that view this year).In Arrival’s case, its crucial, quantitative, positive catalysts include its partnerships with UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) and the huge demand for electric delivery vehicles.After tumbling 91% over the last year and 28% in the last month, ARVL stock has a market capitalization of just $187 million, vastly understating its outlook.SolarEdge (SEDG)the solar edge logo on an iPhone. SEDG stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comThe Street has turned bearish on solar because of its worries about California’s decision to reduce the amount of money it pays its residents for the energy its solar panels send to the grid. Partly because of that fear, the shares of SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), which makes solar inverters, tumbled 44% from Feb. 15 to Feb. 24.However, the outlook for solar energy in both the U.S. and Europe, SolarEdge’s two largest markets, is robust. Both markets’ solar energy utilization is expected to jump tremendously this year.In the U.S., America’s Energy Information Administration recently forecasted that “54.5 GW of total capacity is expected to come online this year,” up from just 10.3 gigawatts last year.And in Europe, there will be over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity linked to the grid in the EU after the bloc’s solar activations jumped 47% in 2022 to 41 gigawatts.“We are confident that further annual market growth will beat all expectations, exceed 50 GW deployment level in 2023, and more than double from today to 85 GW in 2026,” SolarPower asserted.For the fourth quarter, SolarEdge’s revenue soared 61% year-over-year to a record $891 million and came in $11.6 million above analysts’ average estimate. Its operating profit, excluding certain items, was an impressive $150 million, representing an all-time high. For all of 2022, it generated a net income, excluding certain items, of $351 million.Given the company’s strong growth and solar’s positive future, its current market cap of $16.63 billion is way below its long-term outlook.Bionano (BNGO)Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the backgroundSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comStrong evidence indicates that Bionano’s (NASDAQ:BNGO) optical genome technology is tremendously useful, and its usefulness will continue to increase. In a document previously found by a YouTube broadcaster, Mr. INVEST ALOT, a Department of Paediatric Endocrinology professor at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, Paul Dimitri, explains that OGM is extremely useful and will become very widely utilized in the future.Specifically, Dimitri wrote that “Optical genome mapping (OGM)…is now recognised as key genomic technology capable of detecting of all classes of structural variants in many disorders, which will undoubtedly improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis of rare disorders in children.”He added that studies have shown that OGM is superior to standard testing for detecting acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. Additionally, the professor predicted that “Given the extended capabilities of OGM, many undiagnosed conditions in [pediatric patients] will be explored using OGM.”And in more very bullish news, a recent press release from Bionano indicates that the Chinese government has become a backer of OGM and, by extension, Bionano. That’s because, on Feb. 22, Bionano announced that its Chinese partner had obtained approval from Beijing to utilize “Bionano’s DNA extraction kit and labeling products.” Of course, China is a potentially huge market for Bionano.With BNGO down 40% over the last year and its market cap sunk to $377 million, the stock is poised to surge over the long term, given the company’s extraordinarily bright future.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comVolkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) reported a net cash flow of roughly 5 billion euros last year. That was impressive but significantly below the automaker’s target of 8.6 billion euros. However, the company explained that supply-chain issues were primarily responsible for the miss. So with global supply chains generally improving meaningfully, Volkswagen’s profits should jump meaningfully this year. Also worth noting is that the automaker’s operating profit came in at a much higher 22.5 billion euros.Meanwhile, boding very well for Volkswagen’s longer-term outlook, in the third quarter of last year, its “total deliveries” climbed 10% year-over-year. In contrast, its deliveries of electric vehicles soared 25% YOY. And in Europe, where electric vehicles accounted for 24% of total vehicle sales last year, Volkswagen EV brands ranked third and fourth on the top-selling list in December, trailing only Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y.The company’s sales slipped 7% for the full year, but it was still the second-leading automaker by unit sales, behind only Toyota (NYSE:TM). What’s more, its EV sales climbed 26% in 2022.With China and the EU rapidly switching to EVs and the U.S. beginning to follow suit, Volkswagen’s future looks bright.Volkswagen has tumbled 34% in the last year, and it’s changing hands at a very cheap trailing price-earnings ratio of 5.1 while it pays a handsome dividend yield of 4.55%.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of ARVL,JKS,PLUG, BB, and BNGO.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.More and more data points are now indicating an imminent recession in 2023 as the Federal Reserve’s consistent rate hikes didn’t do any quick wonders to stop inflation or slow down the labor market. In this backdrop, investors are eager to invest in stocks that have low volatility, pay dividends and have long-term growth potential. Industrial stocks may give some refuge to investors in this scenario.According to a report by Fidelity, the industrial sector volatility is among the lowest on record over the past few years. The report made a comparison of the equity market sector volatility (15%) with the volatility of several sectors in the market by tracking top 3,000 U.S. stocks as measured by market capitalization. The comparison data, which spans close to two decades, shows that the volatility of the industrials sector is 18%, compared to the 15% market average. The sector fares better than energy, IT, materials, real estate, consumer discretionary and several other sectors. Only three sectors were better than industrials when it comes to volatility: utilities, healthcare and consumer staples.However, the industrials sector is closely linked to the broader economic cycles. When the economy is thriving and demand is strong, industrials tend to perform better. In a report published in June 2022, Edward Jones said that some of the key growth drivers for the industrial sector are construction and infrastructure investment, manufacturing, increasing regulation for energy and fuel efficiency, growth in China, India, Russia, Brazil and the rising middle class.Some major industrial stocks gaining attention this year include Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Story continuesMost Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Remy Gieling on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked the most popular industrial stocks among these hedge funds which have PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 26.Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Canadian logistics and transportation company TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier in February, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.72, missing estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 8.4% on a YoY basis to $1.96 billion, missing estimates by $110 million. Despite the earnings miss, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) rose amid speculation about the company’s acquisition interest in ArcBest Corp after it was revealed that TFI now owns a 4% stake in ArcBest Corp.12. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Home construction and improvement products maker Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Sell recently. The bank said that Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has provided a “reasonably achievable” guidance for 2023. The bank believes the underperformance of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) when compared to its peers justifies an upgrade.Recently, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) also upped its quarterly dividend by 1.8%.For full-year 2023, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) expects its adjusted EPS to come in between $3.10 to $3.40, less than the consensus estimate of $3.64.  Deutsche Bank's estimate was $3.30.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we added one new position—Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products. We believe the market is failing to properly reward the company’s significant upgrades in its product offerings over the past decade. During this time, management has sold off the company’s more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation and windows and cabinets, and now Masco focuses its efforts on some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products—primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)—are more resilient, lower cost and higher margin categories. Both product segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit solid pricing power, and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair-andremodel markets. Despite this greatly improved business mix, Masco trades at a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity for us to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”11. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Logistics and freight forwarding company Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) ranks 11th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD). The total value of these stakes was about $352 million. The biggest stakeholder of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $286 million stake in the firm.Goldman Sachs recently named Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) among a list of companies that are expected to benefit from the reopening of China.10. Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Professional and industrial tools maker Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is one of the notable industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of the December quarter, 29 funds had stakes in Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA).Recently, Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, the same as the previous quarter. Forward dividend yield came in at 2.62%. The dividend is payable on March 10 to shareholders of record as of February 23.9. CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Shares of Italian-American industrials company CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) have gained about 15% over the past 12 months. Still, CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) presents an attractive entry point to investors. Its PE ratio stands at 12.87 as of February 26. Recently, Bank of America picked the industrial stock for 2023 and said in a note that it sees more room for upside potential especially after the spinoff of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)’s on-highway business.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 37 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) during this period was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company. The second biggest stakeholder of CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) was John Smith Clark’s Southpoint Capital Advisors which has a $241 million stake in the company.Artisan Global Discovery Fund made the following comment about CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI), Lattice Semiconductor and Ingersoll Rand. CNH Industrial is the second largest global agricultural equipment company (primarily tractors and combines) with leading brands Case IH and New Holland. The company reported top-line growth of 23.9% in the quarter, which was meaningfully ahead of expectations, and shares rallied on the news. After a long period of relatively stagnant technological developments in the agricultural field, CNH is on a journey to meaningfully expand their technological offerings in areas such as precision agriculture and autonomous technology. Our research indicates that the fleet of agricultural equipment in the world is as old as it has ever been going back 40 years, meaning there is pent-up demand at a time when there is new technological innovation. We believe this sets up CNH for a long-term secular growth opportunity. Last, in our view, additional internal catalysts—a new CEO who previously led an impressive turnaround at Polaris, greater pricing discipline and improvements to its supply chain efficiency—will enable it to narrow its margin gap with competitor John Deere in the periods ahead.”8. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) falls under the integrated freight and logistics segment of the broader industrials sector. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) ranks 8th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 36 hedge funds reported owning stakes in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). Recently, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, which was a 6.6% increase from the previous dividend. Forward dividend yield came in at 3.66%. The dividend is payable on March 10 for shareholders of record as of February 21. UPS, like Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), is one of the most famous stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.In the fourth quarter, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s adjusted EPS came in at $3.62, beating estimates by $0.03. Revenue in the quarter fell 2.7% on a YoY basis to $27 billion, missing estimates by $10.3 billion.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”7. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) falls under the category of heavy machinery within the broader industrials sector.

We decided to sell the position with a looming risk of European energy rationing that could impact manufacturing output this winter. Its shares edged forward by 3% for the time it was held in the quarter.”6.

In a report published in June 2022, Edward Jones said that some of the key growth drivers for the industrial sector are construction and infrastructure investment, manufacturing, increasing regulation for energy and fuel efficiency, growth in China, India, Russia, Brazil and the rising middle class.Some major industrial stocks gaining attention this year include Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)  and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).Story continuesMost Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Remy Gieling on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked the most popular industrial stocks among these hedge funds which have PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 26.Most Undervalued Industrial Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Canadian logistics and transportation company TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued industrial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier in February, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.72, missing estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 8.4% on a YoY basis to $1.96 billion, missing estimates by $110 million. Despite the earnings miss, TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) rose amid speculation about the company’s acquisition interest in ArcBest Corp after it was revealed that TFI now owns a 4% stake in ArcBest Corp.12. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Home construction and improvement products maker Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to Hold from Sell recently. The bank said that Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has provided a “reasonably achievable” guidance for 2023. The bank believes the underperformance of Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) when compared to its peers justifies an upgrade.Recently, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) also upped its quarterly dividend by 1.8%.For full-year 2023, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) expects its adjusted EPS to come in between $3.10 to $3.40, less than the consensus estimate of $3.64.  Deutsche Bank's estimate was $3.30.Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we added one new position—Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products. We believe the market is failing to properly reward the company’s significant upgrades in its product offerings over the past decade. During this time, management has sold off the company’s more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation and windows and cabinets, and now Masco focuses its efforts on some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products—primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)—are more resilient, lower cost and higher margin categories. Both product segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit solid pricing power, and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair-andremodel markets. Despite this greatly improved business mix, Masco trades at a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity for us to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”11. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Logistics and freight forwarding company Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

CNH Industrial is the second largest global agricultural equipment company (primarily tractors and combines) with leading brands Case IH and New Holland. The company reported top-line growth of 23.9% in the quarter, which was meaningfully ahead of expectations, and shares rallied on the news. After a long period of relatively stagnant technological developments in the agricultural field, CNH is on a journey to meaningfully expand their technological offerings in areas such as precision agriculture and autonomous technology. Our research indicates that the fleet of agricultural equipment in the world is as old as it has ever been going back 40 years, meaning there is pent-up demand at a time when there is new technological innovation. We believe this sets up CNH for a long-term secular growth opportunity. Last, in our view, additional internal catalysts—a new CEO who previously led an impressive turnaround at Polaris, greater pricing discipline and improvements to its supply chain efficiency—will enable it to narrow its margin gap with competitor John Deere in the periods ahead.”8.

The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”7.

101,099606c5-4d56-3d6f-8061-77a0ea0d7e30,AWK,2023-03-05,3 Top Defensive Stocks to Own for a Focus on Quality,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-defensive-stocks-own-192842779.html,1677698922,STORY,"['ABBV', 'AWK', 'MCD']","[In today’s volatile and uncertain market, investors increasingly seek stable, reliable, and resilient companies to add to their portfolios. Defensive stocks, which are typically associated with companies that operate in industries that provide essential goods and services, can provide a hedge against market downturns while still delivering consistent returns.While many may seek growth, having a portion of one’s portfolio providing stability can be important. Indeed, in these times, playing it safe may be the best course of action.Accordingly, let’s dive into three top-notch defensive stocks to buy for those looking to focus on quality. Each of these companies have strong financials, durable competitive advantages and long-term growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceMCDMcDonald’s$262.68ABBVAbbVie$153.83AWKAmerican Water Works$139.55McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comAs far as defensive stocks are concerned, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a well-loved classic. The company has historically provided a lengthy track record of steady returns, making it a favorite among investors. Its widespread global presence also reduces its vulnerability to fluctuations in the U.S. economy. For numerous investors, McDonald’s has been an essential player in the global fast-food sector and is viewed as a viable long-term investment. With noteworthy growth figures, the company has proven its capacity to thrive as a top-tier brand, expanding internationally and driving sales growth at existing locations.While there are numerous explanations for why McDonald’s stock performs well in a bullish market, there are three primary factors to consider why this stock is worth owning during periods of turmoil.First, it is less punishing for investors who make incorrect economic predictions, given the trade-down effect consumers are likely to see in the dining sphere in times of economic hardship. Second, its business and stock benefit from favorable market conditions. Finally, the company boasts robust financials, adding to its attractiveness as a stock option.Story continuesMCD’s stock is relatively pricier when compared to its industry peers, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 32 times and a meager dividend yield of 2.3%. With that said, McDonald’s is an ideal option for those who anticipate an upswing but also recognize the possibility of being wrong about its timing. The company’s sound financial footing and stable demand in robust and weak economies make it a perfect safe-haven choice.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comAmong the impressive defensive stocks to consider in the biotech space is AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). This healthcare giant has both a BBB+ rating from S&amp;P Global Ratings as well as a substantial dividend yield of 3.8%. The company has raised its dividend for eleven consecutive years. Although the patent on AbbVie’s crucial Humira drug has expired, investors remain optimistic about the company’s performance this year following its success in 2022. Moreover, ABBV has increased its quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share from $1.41, resulting in a current yield of slightly below 4%.To surpass significant market indices, AbbVie’s most crucial objective is to exceed expectations. The corporation’s revenue and earnings are projected to decrease substantially this year, which is already factored into the stock’s price. However, if AbbVie can outperform expectations, even when they are pessimistic, there is a strong possibility that its shares will increase.AbbVie might experience better performances from other medications in its portfolio. Rinvoq and Skyrizi, Humira’s two successors, have the potential to offer an additional boost. AbbVie predicts the two drugs will generate a combined revenue of $7.5 billion this year.American Water Works (AWK)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockAmerican Water Works (NYSW:AWK), the primary provider of water and wastewater services in the United States, announced its results on Wednesday after the market closed. The company’s Q4 results exceeded expectations, but the company’s stock still declined modestly as investors assess this stock relative to other better-yielding options in the utilities sector.American Water maintained strong acquisition momentum in the regulated water and wastewater utilities market. In 2022, the company acquired 26 utilities across seven states, resulting in approximately 70,000 new customer connections. Investors searching for a secure utility stock that pays dividends and offers strong potential for overall capital appreciation may need help to discover a more suitable option than American Water Works. Despite not being among the top-performing water utility stocks in 2022, the company has consistently outperformed its industry peers over an extended period.Although it is essential to monitor interest rates, the company’s size gives it advantages in terms of scalability and the ability to make acquisitions. As of March 2022, it pays a quarterly dividend of $2.41, which translates to a yield of 1.5%.American Water Works generated $3.8 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ended Dec. 31. In the most recent quarter, year-over-year sales decreased by 2.1%. Analysts anticipate that adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year will reach $4.80 per share. The company’s current dividend yield is 1.9%.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

An inflation shock took hold, driving the annualized inflation rate from 1.4% in January 2021 to 7% to close out the year. Moreover, the recently released inflation data suggest that inflation will continue to weigh down the economy for the better half of 2023. Therefore, I wouldn’t blame investors for looking at some of the best stocks to buy to battle what could be yet another inflation shock this year.Perhaps the best action for investors is to increase exposure to safer bets and diversify their holdings. The top sectors to invest in during periods of high inflation typically include real estate, energy, and commodities. You could throw in high-quality tech stocks that have held up well during economic downturns. Additionally, wagering on dividend stocks with a healthy track record of payouts won’t hurt either.Let’s look at some of the best inflation stocks to buy, keeping the above in mind.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsENBEnbridge$37.52MSFTMicrosoft$249.42FCXFreeport-McMoran$40.97JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$153.26NOBLS&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF$90.71PRUPrudential$100.00ORealty Income$63.95Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCanada-based Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is one of the most famous traditional energy stocks.

Moreover, its fee-based business model has allowed the firm to build its colossal cash war chest of over $1.1 billion.The firm benefitted from higher oil and gas prices for the better part of last year, helping it post double-digit top-line growth. Following the slowdown in energy prices, it stumbled in the third quarter of 2022, but returned to generating big bucks last quarter.Story continuesMoreover, it is among the highest dividend-yielding real asset stocks, offering an excellent 7% yield. On top of that, its stock trades at just 2-times forward sales estimates, roughly 16% lower than its 5-year average. The momentum in its stock price has slowed significantly of late, which points to an excellent opportunity to load up on this stock now.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of the most popular tech businesses ever, and is arguably more relevant than ever. With its investments in AI behemoth ChatGPT, and its move to acquire video gaming giant Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), the firm is set to add new chapters to its impressive growth story. Additionally, the massive potential of these business moves hasn’t been fully priced-in, meaning I expect MSFT stock to continue to surge to new heights this year.I believe that the incredible success story that is its Azure cloud division is often underappreciated. Revenues from the segment have grown at a double-digit rate over the past several quarters and have helped effectively balance the sluggishness of its other divisions.Moreover, MSFT Stock has been a remarkable wealth compounder, generating over 750% returns in the past decade. Its record of shareholder wealth creation is as impressive as it gets, having returned over $26.5 billion via share buybacks in the past year alone.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comLeading copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has taken investors on a turbulent ride over the past few years. Its ill-advised foray into the oil and gas sector in 2013 led to the stock shedding over 50% of its value. However, it has returned its attention to copper, establishing itself as the top producer in the niche. Also, the firm has made substantial contributions to the lucrative gold and molybdenum markets over the years.Despite a challenging market, FCX stock has a tremendous wealth compounder, growing over 300% in value over the past three years. Additionally, hedge fund activity in the stock has remained remarkably consistent in the past nine quarters, a testament to the quality of the stock.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comYou don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand why pharma giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) features on my list of stocks to bet on for those worried about an extended inflation shock. Johnson &amp; Johnson boasts a consistent track record of growing its top and bottom lines from its blockbuster lineup of drugs. More importantly, for investors, it’s paid a dividend in the past 60 consecutive years, no small feat.If you’re looking for a wealth compounder, though, JNJ stock wouldn’t be your cup of tea. In its defense, the stock has offered a considerable 18% price return over the past five years. However, its strength lies in the stability of its business, having generated stellar profitability and cash flow growth over the past several years.Despite the current inflationary pressures, JNJ stock has generated a trailing twelve-month free cash flow yield of over 20% and a return on equity of around 23.5%. Therefore, it represents an excellent hedge against inflation.S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL)Three wood blocks spelling out ""ETF"". representing best etfsSource: ShutterstockPicking individual stocks carries a significantly higher risk than investing in a diversified basket. Hence, for many investors, it may be more apt to wager on exchange-traded funds (ETFs).The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL) is arguably one of the best-performing ETFs, offering exposure to 64 top-tier businesses with dividend aristocrat status. These companies have successfully grown their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Additionally, NOBL stock has had an excellent record of increasing investor returns, offering a 5-year return of 58% compared to 17.2% (Median of all ETFs).Naturally, these businesses aren’t speculative bets, as they have effectively increased earnings in line with inflation and other macroeconomic pressures. The companies held in this ETF have the potential to dampen the effect of inflation on their businesses by passing along higher costs to the consumer.Prudential (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential (NYSE:PRU) is an excellent choice for long-term investors, offering a healthy balance between stability and growth. With over 140 years in the insurance space, it has proven resilient in the face of multiple economic downturns, while expanding its reach to become one of the leading life insurers worldwide. Having operations in more than 40 countries gives Prudential the scale to spread their risk across multiple geographical markets.Prudential boasts an excellent dividend portfolio offering a robust dividend yield of over 5%, with 14 consecutive years of payout growth. The company’s consistent payouts are supported by its rock-solid cash balance that continues to move from strength to strength.Its cash position soared to $1.7 billion last year, representing a massive 51% bump from its balance in 2013. The firm’s substantial cash reserves allow it to benefit from higher interest rates, as it can invest the cash generated from premiums and annuities in fixed-income instruments.Realty Income (O)Real estate agent handing over a house key, desktop with tools, wood swatches and computer on background, top view.

The firm has raised monthly dividends for over 52 years, becoming a dividend aristocrat.The popular real-estate investment trust operates one of the most consistent businesses in its niche.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Suggests It's 34% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-cisco-systems-inc-140014734.html,1677938414,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsCisco Systems' estimated fair value is US$74.21 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$49.28 suggests Cisco Systems is potentially 34% undervalued Analyst price target for CSCO is US$56.76 which is 24% below our fair value estimateToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.7bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$18.6bUS$19.5bUS$20.2bUS$20.8bUS$21.3bUS$21.9bUS$22.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.98%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.52%Est @ 2.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$14.6kUS$14.9kUS$13.9kUS$13.6kUS$13.2kUS$12.7kUS$12.1kUS$11.5kUS$10.9kUS$10.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$128bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$382bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$382b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$176bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$304b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$49.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?
