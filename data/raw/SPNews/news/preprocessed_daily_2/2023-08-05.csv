The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Charles Schwab's shares before the 10th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.00 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Charles Schwab has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current share price of $64.92. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Charles Schwab paying out a modest 27% of its earnings.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Charles Schwab's earnings per share have been growing at 17% a year for the past five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Charles Schwab has increased its dividend at approximately 15% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Charles Schwab for the upcoming dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. In summary, Charles Schwab appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.So while Charles Schwab looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example - Charles Schwab has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$186 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$161. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Texas Instruments' current trading price of US$172 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Texas Instruments’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What Is Texas Instruments Worth?According to my valuation model, Texas Instruments seems to be fairly priced at around 6.2% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Texas Instruments today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $183.09, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Texas Instruments’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Texas Instruments?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 16% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Texas Instruments. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TXN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TXN, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Texas Instruments at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Texas Instruments (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Texas Instruments, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

9,9392f680-cd62-3ea6-8f82-34b081ac25fa,USB,2023-08-05,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 75%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-favorite-120218575.html,1691236938,STORY,['USB'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies U.S. Bancorp's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions46% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have been buying lately If you want to know who really controls U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of U.S. Bancorp, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 6.8% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$123m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with U.S. Bancorp , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:WMT) Will Be Trading Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-four-days-till-walmart-120557880.html,1691237157,STORY,['WMT'],"[Readers hoping to buy Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Walmart's shares before the 10th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 5th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.57 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.28 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Walmart has a trailing yield of 1.4% on the current stock price of $158.34. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Walmart Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Walmart is paying out an acceptable 54% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 31% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Walmart's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Walmart earnings per share are up 5.0% per annum over the last five years. Earnings growth has been slim and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Walmart has lifted its dividend by approximately 1.9% a year on average.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Walmart? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Walmart paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Walmart you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Easter spending tops out at $24 billion. Halloween and July Fourth sales bring in about $10 billion each.Billions more are spent on New Year’s, the Labor Day and Memorial Day weekends, and Juneteenth celebrations. Every three months, retailers discount to mark the end of a season with more deals. And then there are retail-specific events, like Amazon’s Prime Day.“The seasonality is unique to the retail business, with surges of promotions and demand,” says Anil Madan, corporate vice president of cloud data platforms at Walmart.That ebb and flow of demand is what makes cloud computing so alluring to retailers. The elasticity of the cloud allows retailers like Walmart to migrate quickly to public cloud services when demand surges, but only pay for that computation power when it’s needed.Experts say that retailers are adopting cloud effectively compared with many other sectors, especially brands that were built on e-commerce, like Wayfair or Warby Parker. And the cloud has vast applications for retailers, ranging from transactions; management of their supply chain; pricing, tracking, and accounting for returns; and figuring out shoppers’ every attribute to more effectively recommend goods, which ultimately increases sales.“They are playing 3D chess,” says David Linthicum, Deloitte’s chief cloud strategy officer. “They are able to understand how you buy things and move you to another retail site and upsell you there. They are leveraging cloud strategically as an innovative weapon.”All the major retail players are talking up how they are using the cloud to better connect with customers. Starbucks’ systems that record digital ordering and loyalty run on Amazon’s AWS, using analytics and data to better understand customers’ preferences. Best Buy also leans on AWS to allow shoppers to virtually interact with experts and see live demos of physical items. Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, last month announced it would use AWS’s palm recognition service to identify customers at all U.S. locations by the end of the year. Target takes a hybrid-multicloud approach—relying on AWS, IBM, Google, and Microsoft, saying each server has its own strengths for the retailer to leverage.Story continuesWalmart pairs public clouds from Google and Microsoft with the retailer’s own private cloud to connect distribution and fulfillment centers with Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, ensuring a speedy system to meet demand for shopping habits that are increasingly blurring the lines between in-person and online experiences. Madan says there’s also greater flexibility and resiliency in Walmart’s triple-cloud model.“Cloud today powers every part of our omnichannel experience,” says Madan, who spoke with Fortune in July.Walmart’s customers, Madan claims, are shifting their mindsets from “do it with me” to a more proactive demand that retailers “do it for me,” meaning they want a more seamless end-to-end experience when buying goods.An example of the role of cloud computing can be seen in voice assistant ordering through smart-home devices like Google Home. A Walmart shopper can add items to their cart—a loaf of bread, orange juice, a dozen eggs—and preselect how they want these orders to be filled, including deliveries to their home. Cloud enables fulfillment of the purchase from warehouse to fridge.A family checks out new holiday toys in a Walmart store.Cloud also can help improve the in-person shopping experience. When shoppers visit a Walmart or Sam’s Club today, if they need help finding headphones or a piece of furniture, associates can use the Ask Sam app on their phone to pull up store maps and locate the product.Walmart doesn’t differentiate between an online and in-person shopper, and this represents both the greatest challenge and the biggest opportunity as retailing continues to evolve. “How do you blend these experiences?” asks Madan. “Recognizing more and more that consumers are omnichannel in nature.”Broadly, retailers are using cloud to manage their supply chain and logistics, as the technology allows for greater automation to obtain data, better strategies for how to use it, and stronger prediction models.“You don’t need to be sitting on a pile of inventory to make sure you don’t run out,” says Sebastian Bak, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group. “You can run much leaner because you are more sophisticated and you anticipate things better.”Scott Russell, a member of SAP’s executive board and head of global customer success, sees the trend similarly. “More recently, we’ve seen a lot of companies in the retail segment use cloud technology to manage their returns, their supply-chain process, and demand signals to better predict what supply they need and manage that more effectively,” he says.Consumers return more than $816 billion worth of merchandise annually in the United States. The use of cloud for more intelligent return management can help predict where those returns are coming from, guide customers on how to make a return efficiently, and better track the returns that flow back into the supply chain.SAP works with major retailers and consumer-product companies on their cloud strategies and says all the major players are predominantly cloud first. Apparel makerHanesBrands uses cloud to better inform decision-making in managing its supplier base. Cloud helps athletic retailing giant Nike better target customers by using consumer insights to ensure its campaigns reach the right shoppers.Russell says retailers today are more focused on the life-cycle behavior of their customers—not only what they bought and when, but whether they returned to buy the same item. Did they return anything? And if so, why? And what other products did they attach to that order?“Retailers are getting sharper at this,” says Russell. “So they can not only predict the demand signals, but they are able to predict what a customer’s next ongoing steps will be as a result of these recommendations and insights.”And while retailers often talk about their omnichannel expertise—the connection between their brick-and-mortar stores and online channels—experts say those points of interaction are often limited to a single email address. Retailers are looking to create a more continuous connection, and one way to do that is with generative A.I. and cloud. This technology, while not used much yet, could better empower virtual assistants that interact with shoppers to make recommendations more effectively than a human could.Generative A.I. and cloud can also help unlock better models to determine what prices to charge for goods. “Today it is almost impossible to be a sophisticated pricing retailer without having cloud infrastructure in the background,” says Bak.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Slack's CEO moves forward with her plan to integrate the platform with Salesforce, women are leaving VC roles in Europe, and Lo Bosworth's Love Wellness went from an easy target to Target and Walmart. - World of wellness. Seven years ago, Lo Bosworth launched her brand Love Wellness. Bosworth was best known for appearing on the reality TV series Laguna Beach and The Hills as a teen. Her brand's first products were for vaginal health. Headlines like ""Reality TV star sells vaginal health treatments"" didn't make for an easy debut.""It was not an immediate success,"" Bosworth recalls now. ""The media was confused. The brand was made fun of and I was made fun of.""But they don't get made fun of anymore. The brand has expanded its assortment from vaginal health products—which it always intended to support gut health—to other popular wellness products like probiotics, sleep aids, and antibloating pills. Love Wellness's products are sold for around $25 a bottle in Ulta, Target, and as of last month, 1,650 Walmart stores.Love Wellness employs about 45 people. The startup raised a $4 million Series A round in 2019. Bosworth, who started as a solo operator in her living room, stepped down as CEO earlier this year. She brought on Maria Dempsey, the former CEO of Nest and and alum of Lancôme and Clarins, to replace her.Lo Bosworth, CEO and founder of Love WellnessAs the brand has expanded, Bosworth has learned about the power of retail shelves. ""When you provide women with the products they really need, in a place in the store where they're not embarrassed to be, you will see the results you're hoping for,"" she says. Love Wellness's products are sold in the natural beauty aisle at Target and the digestive health aisle at Walmart. ""If you go into the condom or tampon aisle, you're running in and out—it's not a place you want to stay to hang out,"" she adds. ""But in a different part of the store where you're more comfortable picking up products and reading labels, you're much more open to discovery.""Story continuesStarting a brand was Bosworth's own form of personal discovery. ""I was trying to transition away from the entertainment industry,"" she says. She moved from California, where the TV shows she appeared on were filmed, to New York. She found her ""sweet spot"" as the founder and operator of a consumer brand. ""In the entertainment industry, you never know when your next job is going to come. It's very hard to be the master of your own destiny,"" she says. ""When you do something like what I'm doing now, it's a much different story.""Seeing other wellness brands dip their toes into the more stigmatized women's health space where Love Wellness started has been rewarding for Bosworth, especially after experiencing so much skepticism at first. Then there are the vaginal health-focused startups like Evvy and Uqora. ""I'm relieved we were so early to the category,"" she says.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance.training, closeup, technician, micro, technical, printed, tool, solder, engineering, processor, mount, digital, engineer, circuit, technology, microchip, computer, soldering,Posonskyi Andrey/Shutterstock.com Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share based compensation and certain other adjustments that are described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation on our website. Net sales in the June quarter were $2.289 billion, which was up to 2.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.4%, operating expenses were at 20.3% and operating income was a record 48.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $905.3 million and Non-GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basis was a record $1.64. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter gross margins were a record at 68.1%. Total operating expenses were $655.3 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of a $151.5 million, special charges of $1.7 million, share bases compensation of $37.7 million and a benefit of $0.4 million for other matters. GAAP net income was a record $666.4 million, resulting in a record $1.21 in per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 14.2% in the June quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal ‘24 cash tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal ‘23 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses, tax credits, lower tax depreciation and our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal ’24, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&amp;D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&amp;D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If that were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchips, non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2023 was $1.336 billion. We had 167 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was down two days from the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory days in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked to, as we accommodated requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. We also continue to invest in building inventory for products with long lives and high margins, whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners, and these last-time buys represented eight days of inventory at the end of June. We expect dollars and days of inventory on our balance sheet to reduce in the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter – excuse me, in the June quarter was at 29 days, which was up five days from the prior quarter's level. Compared to our other regions, inventory at our Asia distributors grew the most in the quarter, as sell-through activity was down significantly on a sequential basis in this region, heavily driven by unfavorable business conditions in China. Our cash flow from operating activities was $993.2 million in the June quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $106.1 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time, as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $776 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $271.2 million. We paid down $413 million of total debt in the June quarter, and our net debt was reduced by $450.2 million. Over the last 24 quarters, since we closed the Microsemi acquisition, and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $6.76 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. In the June quarter, we retired $1 billion in bonds that matured using our line of credit to do so. Our line of credit had $725 million of borrowings against it at June 30, 2023, after paying off the $1 billion in bonds. During the June quarter we also retired $38 million of total principal amounts of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible bonds for a total cash payment of $90.1 million. The amount paid above the principal amount essentially works like a synthetic stock buyback, reducing any current and future share count dilution that will result if these convertible bonds were ever converted into shares. The over $50 million we paid above the par value for the convertible bonds was in addition to our normal share buyback activity that we executed during the quarter, resulting in an additional reduction in the dilutive shares outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record at $1.172 billion and 51.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.473 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was $1.29 at June 30, 2023, down from $1.45 at March 31, 2023, and down from $2.05 at June 30, 2022. Capital expenditures were $111.1 million in the June quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $400 million, as we still have a lot of equipment that was ordered with long lead times that we will be receiving over the next year. We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $50.5 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh, to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter, as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh? Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Our June quarter results were strong in the context of a slowing macro environment, marked by our continued disciplined execution, as well as our resilient end markets and diversified customer base. Net sales grew 2.5% sequentially and 16.6% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record of $2.29 billion. The June quarter represented our 11th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins were both records at 68.4% and 48.1% respectively. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64 per share, another record by a whisker and up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was a record 51.2% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow was 33.9% of net sales in the June quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation characteristics of our business. Our net leverage exiting June dropped to 1.29x. We returned $349.2 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the June quarter, representing 67.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow. Our capital return to shareholders in the September quarter will increase to 72.5% of our June quarter adjusted free cash flow, as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. My profuse thanks to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results despite the increasingly challenging macro environment, and especially to the worldwide Microchip team whose tireless efforts and agility to adapt are what enable us to navigate effectively through the business cycles. Taking a look at our June quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed signal microcontroller net sales set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 0.8% in the June quarter and up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our analog net sales also set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 2.5% in the June quarter and up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. Our FPGA net sales, which we comment on from time-to-time, had another record quarter with annualized revenue growth continuing to be in the double digits. Now for some color on the June quarter. While our overall business remains steady, our customers continue to feel the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty. Starting in early June, we saw business conditions deteriorate in three areas. First, our China business was much weaker than our expectations and has not recovered from the shutdowns of last year and the Lunar New Year holidays in the March quarter. This manifested in weak sell-through activity and the building of inventory in the distribution channel in China. Second, we started to see initial signs of weakness and uncertainty in the automotive and industrial segments, reflecting the impact of high inflation and high interest rates driving more cautious spending. And third, we are seeing early signs of an impending slowdown in Europe, exacerbated by some of our European customers being dependent on exports to countries like China, whereas we know that the business environment is much weaker than expected. As a result, we continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers start to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and increased uncertainty they were experiencing. We were able to push out meaningful amounts of non-reschedulable backlog to later quarters to help many customers with inventory positions. While the rate of cancellation and push-out requests appears to be stabilizing, we expect request to push out or cancel backlog will likely be with us through the rest of calendar 2023, as customers adjust to their new demand environment and attempt to de-risk their inventory position commensurately. We are also seeing an increasing direct and indirect impact from the cumulative effect of U.S. export control actions, especially in China. These actions were less of an issue over the last few quarters when demand was significantly higher than supply, but are more of an issue now as demand and supply come more into balance. Despite all the factors mentioned so far, in the June quarter we were able to reverse the growth in days of inventory on our balance sheet, with inventory dropping by two days to 167 days, of which, eight days of inventory were from an investment in last-time buys of high-margin, long-lived products whose manufacturing capacity was being end of life by our supply chain. Reflecting the slowing macro-environment, especially in China, our channel inventory grew by 5 days to 29 days. We continue to take actions to further reduce the days of inventory on our balance sheet, while maintaining absorption in our internal wafer fabrication factories. We're also working with our channel partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve customers and to be positioned for an eventual strengthening of business conditions. Finally, while our overall inventory is still a bit higher than our target, we made excellent progress to position our inventory at the best locations in manufacturing to be able to rapidly respond to demand growth when the macro environment strengthens. Consistent with the slowing macro environment and the higher than target level of inventory on our balance sheet, as well as with some of our customers and channel partners, most of our internal factory expansion actions remain paused. This we expect will result in lower capital investments in fiscal year ‘24 and fiscal year ‘25. During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe shorter lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully, and improve the quality of backlog placed on us. We have been able to reduce average lead time from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly 26 weeks by the end of the June quarter, and we expect to continue to drive lead times down farther in the coming months. We have heard concerns from some of the investment community about falling lead times, because it results in lower backlog. While this is often true, we believe the level of backlog does not equate to true end market consumption. And in the final analysis, shorter lead times enable our customers and Microchip to navigate an uncertain environment with agility and more effectively. So now let's get into the guidance for the September quarter. Although our backlog for the September quarter is strong, we are continuing to take active steps to help customers with inventory positions to push out their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be between up 1% and down 3% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance for the September quarter, our year-over-year growth for the quarter would be 9.3%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.3% and 68.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.1% and 20.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.8% and 48.4% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.64. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 11% despite a much higher tax rate than the year-ago quarter. As supply and demand come into balance, we expect normal seasonality to return to our business. Historically, the December quarter has been our seasonally weakest quarter. This year, we expect that our normal seasonality in the December quarter will likely be amplified by the macro weakness and business uncertainty that our customers are experiencing. As a result, we anticipate further business headwinds in the December quarter. However, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the markets and applications we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continues to fuel strong design momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. Finally, as you can see from our June quarter results and our September quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy which we launched 21 months ago, continues to be the foundation of our results, as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high-growth, high-margin, high-cash generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. However, we recognize that we operate in a cyclical industry and that we're not immune to the business cycles. If you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, which is included in the investor presentation posted on our website, you will observe our robust and consistent cash-generation, gross margin and operating margin results. Although we don't know what exactly the future holds, if we were to experience a semiconductor inventory correction like what the industry has seen in the past, we are highly confident that our non-GAAP operating margins would remain well above 40%, and we expect our cash-generation, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle. And with that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve. Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflective on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA, and all of that in a continuing challenging environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 36.2% from the year ago quarter to $0.41 per share. During the last quarter we purchased $140.3 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $208.9 million in dividends, thus the total cash return was $349.2 million. This amount was 67.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $517.3 million during the March 2023 quarter. Our pay down of debt, as well as record adjusted EBITDA, drove down a net leverage at the end of June 2023 quarter to 1.29x from 2.05x at the end of June 2022. Ever since we achieved an investment great rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $2.686 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2023 by a combination of dividends and stock buybacks. In the current September quarter we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter to target the cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $106.1 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the June quarter was $776 million. We plan to return 72.5% or $562.6 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $223 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $339.6 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of our adjusted free cash flow return to shareholders. This will take six more quarters, and dividends over time we expect will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned. With that operator will you please poll for questions?

Our first question is going to come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open. Tore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your orders. I mean up backlog and the backlog that will make sense, but I was just wondering if you could update us on orders especially by region, and are you seeing any sort of signs of life at all from China, because obviously they are trying to stimulate the economy and just wondering if you’ve seen any data points there at all. Ganesh Moorthy: I think going through the month of July, we have not yet seen China recover. There are discussions I understand about things they may do in the rest of this quarter, those have to be seen. So I don't have anything more to add with respect to China. Our bookings have been weak. We do expect in time that those will begin to strengthen. There is still a lot of backlog that we are carrying and we are pushing out backlog. So there is not an immediate requirement for bookings to spring back to where they used to be. Tore Svanberg: Perfect. Thank you. Ganesh Moorthy: You’re welcome. Eric Bjornholt: Maybe I can just add to that. You know bookings are a reflection of where lead times are and with lead times coming down, the customers just aren't viewing that they need to put the backlog in place, because our lead times are falling pretty rapidly. Tore Svanberg: Make sense. Thank you, Eric. Operator: Our next question is going to come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open. Vijay Rakesh : Yes, hi. Just a quick question. I was wondering, when you look at your supply chain, where are you seeing any – what are you seeing on the pricing side if you were to look at China or just globally? Ganesh Moorthy: You know, supply chains are stable in most places where we buy wafers from, where we buy some of our assembly and test services from. Clearly, on some of the materials, there may have been some movement in certain cases. I don't think we track it at the level that perhaps you may be interested in. But I would say supply chains are stable, lead times have come down, we’re able to get what we need. Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And in general, if you look at trends as you look out on the pricing side, any thoughts you could share? I mean, what has been trends and what have you seen in the last two, three years and how you see that going forward, I guess. That's it, thanks a lot. Ganesh Moorthy: In our business, for the embedded solutions business, pricing tends to be a lot more stable. Pricing is something you establish at the point of doing your new design and activity, not at the point at which you're fulfilling demand that's coming in. And outside of the last two years where there was significant inflation that we faced and that we passed on to our customers, pricing is usually relatively stable over time. We're not looking to reduce pricing or to increase pricing. And as we go forward, I don't expect that it's going to change in the way that our business runs. Vijay Rakesh : All right, thank you. Eric Bjornholt: You’re welcome. Operator: Our next question is going to come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. You're in line as open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Sort of a multi-part, but related Ganesh. When I look at the September quarter outlook, it's kind of flattish, even though you're describing the situation at getting somewhat tougher. And then as I look out to the December quarter, I think you mentioned it could be worse than seasonal. But even with the headwinds, do you see a scenario where Microchip could continue to grow year-on-year or you think we should be thinking about, the first quarter of year-on-year declines. And if they were to, right, decline year-on-year, what would be the effect on gross margins? Ganesh Moorthy: We haven't modeled what the December quarter nor are we guiding to what the December quarter is going to be. There are a range of scenarios that we are working with, and I don't really have any more color to offer on it. With respect to the gross margins, as we have said many times, we have a pretty strong resilience to the way the gross margin works. If you look at our inside-outside mix, we still have a 60% outside mix. We are continuing to run our fact, where for absorption purposes we are building the product that we need to build and building some inventory. So really, I'm not trying to provide any guidance for December that you might have, but you're absolutely right. We are expecting that the December quarter is going to be weaker than normal seasonality.Vivek Arya : Thank you. Operator: Our next question is going to come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ambrish Srivastava : Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about automotive and industrial. Industrial has weakened for some of the competitors for quite a few quarters, and auto's continues to be strong, you know more or less, although the growth rate seems to be descending. What's your take on having these for several cycles? We just started here and lead times on our contracting. So how many quarters do you think the weakness in auto, and to that matter industry for your business we should expect loss? Ganesh Moorthy: You know, it's very difficult for me to answer that question. There is that question of, which part of this is just inventory digestion that's taking place. And how much of it is consumption changes and how consumptions changes might change? So just using China as the example, China consumption was weak or weaker than anyone expected in the June quarter. Now, how does it come back in the September or December quarters is anybody's guess and where it's at. So I don't have a clear view of how long does automotive or industrial stay weak. We've gone through many cycles. They don't last forever obviously, and there are some typical cycles you can look back on and see how they perform. Ambrish Srivastava : Well, it's true. I just had a quick follow-up, Ganesh. I'm struggling with the R part of the NCNRs. What's the learning here? Has it allowed you to reduce the volatility that usually used to occur when we were going into a downturn, because you keep rescheduling these. I shouldn't say keep. A couple of quarters you rescheduled these, and you expect another reschedule next quarter. What's the right way investors should think about this? Because we've seen NCNRs by many companies improve, and so I don't know what's the learning from this. A - Ganesh Moorthy: Well, the purpose of the NCNR was to get a mutual commitment of investment we were going to make and benefit a customer was going to get. It's based on a set of assumptions about where business is going to go, and I think as lead times go farther and farther out, everybody's visibility gets to be less clear. And the vast majority of the customers who were part of the NCNR programs have been extremely happy with what they were able to get in an extremely different environment in 2021 and 2022. You know, no program is perfect. I believe that our programs have had substantially more benefit than issues with them. We are at a point of the cycle where the demand curve has changed, and as that demand curve changes, we have to adjust. And by the way, the same demand curve will change again as we go into 2024. So I think we have to look beyond the short-term view of where this all ends up and look at how do these programs provide mutual benefit in the medium to long term. Ambrish Srivastava : Makes sense. Thank you. A - Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome. Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you, guys. I guess you're describing an environment in which you're seeing weakness in multiple regions, weakness in multiple end markets, and you're characterizing that as kind of early signs of that, and yet you're only guiding down 1% quarter-on-quarter. So I guess its like, do you have a level of demand that's lower than this? I mean, you have a lot of backlog right now. What happens as that backlog runs out. Can you just give us a sense for what type of drawdown we might be looking at over the course of the next few quarters? Just anything qualitative you can help, so that would be great. A - Ganesh Moorthy: We’re calling it as we see it. We've given you a guidance for September quarter that brackets between plus one and minus three, and that reflects what we see today in our backlog and what we see in the tone of the business. We're giving you a sense that the December quarter is going to be seasonally weaker than normal. And again, it has a number of puts and takes that could go into it. I don't know what more I can say, Joe. It's the best that we're able to peer into the future and provide some insight as to where we think business is going. Joe Moore : I can appreciate that. Thank you. And then, in terms of the 40% operating margin, can you give us a sense for what the parameters are of that? Like how much – you know, is that kind of a normal revenue weakness that you might have seen two or three years ago? Could you still do a north of 40% if it's worse than that? Can you just give us a sense for your confidence in the durability of that number?Ganesh Moorthy: Our confidence is pretty high. We have looked at a number of scenarios. We've looked at how other cycles have gone, and I think we'll be well above 40% in the way that we have modeled it in the different scenarios that we have brought. Eric, do you want to add more to it? A - Eric Bjornholt: Yes, I think you've summed it up well Ganesh. We've done scenario planning and do not see a scenario where our operating margins on a non-GAAP basis could fall below 40%. So we're very comfortable in making that statement. Maybe the other piece that I would add to Ganesh's first response is, I think it's a little bit tricky for investors to understand what is normal seasonality for microchip, because the supply constraints have been under for the last couple of years now, they did play a part in that, and then we've done a lot of acquisitions historically, right? But we would say that probably a normal December seasonal might be down 3% or 4%. So hopefully that provides some context, and we're saying that based on the conditions that we're seeing, it you know likely could be – what's the word, Ganesh? [Cross Talk] yes, amplified. Joe Moore : Great. Thanks so much for your candor. Much appreciated. Operator: Our next question is going to come from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Joshua Buchalter: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. In the past you've sort of given us rough levels of where you expected inventory to come in in the quarter. I guess given we're going through this digestion period, can you give us any level that you would feel comfortable with? What sort of targets are you thinking about for on-books and in the channel when you would feel more comfortable that you're shipping closer to end demand? Thank you. Ganesh Moorthy: You know, I think the channel inventory is driven by in part what the channel wants to carry, what we can supply, and what their demand intensity is. So we don't try to guide where's the channel inventory going to go. It goes where it goes based on those factors. We do take a lot of effort on the internal inventory inside microchip and we have an added factor at this point, which is we are customers who have inventory positions and are looking for push-out help. And that has caused us to go slower than we would normally have liked, but it's the right long-term answer for us and for our customers. And we do expect as Eric said, to have both, a reduction in absolute and days of inventory on our balance sheet in the September quarter. Joshua Buchalter: I appreciate the color there. As my follow-up, I mean given that dynamic, your gross margin suggests that there's no real material cut, at least on your internal utilization rates. Can you talk about how you're thinking about running your factory through this period of digestion, and then I guess the same question for your foundry partners as well. Thank you. A - Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. So, our internal fabs are continuing to run relatively unchanged. These products are very long-lived products. In many cases had been depleted in the inventory points that we typically need to be able to serve at a high level of certainty, as well as the lead time we want. So our internal factories and the internal fabs in particular are continuing to run. And our foundry partners, depending on where the inventory levels were, in some cases, we will be adjusting and have adjusted the purchasing to bring that inventory into line with where we want to be long-term. Joshua Buchalter: Thank you. A - Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome. Operator: Our next question is going to come from Chris Caso with Wolf Research. Your line is open. Chris Caso: Yes. Good evening, thank you. First question is about, I guess something we haven't spoken about in a while, a potential for the requirement for turns. And can you speak about that, given the reduction in lead times, the fact that customers are booking closer in? Are we in a situation… [Audio Gap] A - Ganesh Moorthy: Chris, we may have lost you. Can you hear us? Operator: It looks like this is line hijacked. So, until he calls back, we'll just move on to the next person in queue. And that's going to be Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.Harlan Sur: Hi, Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, the team had a target to get average lead times down to 26 weeks in the second half. I mean you're there now given the scheduling activity and the near-term demand weakness, improving boundary capacity, right? I think normal average, historical lead times for you guys have been in that eight to 12-week range. Is this that kind of a range that you expect as you move to the second half of the year now? And just a quick follow-up, do you guys expect to see your channel distribution inventories continue to rise from the 29-day level in this weak environment? A - Ganesh Moorthy: So first, to take the lead times. You know, we are continuing to drive lead times down. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that short lead times is what makes us all effective and agile in an unpredictable business environment that we're in. And we're, on average, at just under 26 weeks right now. I think we will end the year at well under 13 weeks. It could be under 10 weeks by that time, but we'll know how we progress in that time. Four to eight weeks is where our lead times are for 90% or so of our line items as a historical benchmark for where we were. With respect to distribution inventory, as I mentioned a little earlier on, it has many functions. It's a function of what kind of sell-through are they seeing? What kind of inventory do they want to carry? What are we able to supply, that maybe they've been asking for some time to be able to do it? So, I don't have any color on what distribution inventory is likely to be doing, you know outside of what we've provided so far for June. Harlan Sur: Okay. Thanks, Ganesh. A - Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome. Thanks Harlan. Chris, are you back? Operator: Yes. Chris Caso, your line is open again. Chris Caso : Yes. Not sure what happened, but thank you. So, the question was on the terms environment. Yes, obviously you haven't seen turns in several quarters given the high backlog. Is that something you contemplate either for the September quarter and December quarter? And can you tell us how you're thinking about that returns business under the context of shortening lead time? A - Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, we certainly expect that turns will be a requirement as we go into the December quarter. And then also, the normal part of the business that we have done right, and so most things are starting to normalize again with respect to lead times, what kind of backlog coverage we'll have and turns is just something else we'll have to manage as we normally do, starting from the December quarter onwards. Chris Caso : Okay. But it starts in December, not in September? A - Ganesh Moorthy: There may have been small parts in the September quarter. I mean we're one-third of the way in through the September quarter. Chris Caso : Right, right, that's helpful. As a follow-up, I wonder if you could expand on some of the comments about Europe. And we heard from various others in the industry, you know obviously we can say about China, you know there's been a bit here and there about industrial and auto, but really not any comments about Europe, that's something new, and if you could expand upon what you're seeing there. A - Ganesh Moorthy: Yes, as I mentioned, I think Europe is more – as I look forward, there are more headwinds that European economies are facing. I believe technically Germany is now in a recession. It's had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP and interest rates are still high, inflation is still high. There's energy inflation, which is larger than in the U.S. and some of the large European economies rely on export, China being one. To the extent China is weak, we're going to see some of that weakness in China, but we'll also see some of the weakness in Europe, when their exports are not quite realized. That's the addition of all of what we see as we look into where are things going, and the impact from Europe.Chris Caso : Got it. It’s helpful. Thank you and thank you for coming back to my question. A - Ganesh Moorthy: You're welcome. Thanks Chris and welcome back. Operator: Our next question is going to come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I had a question on cancellations. And in the past or you know, you've been working with customers on – allowing push outs. But in the past, you've sort of – you know, you've been offering customers to cancel for a fee. So if you want to bring down backlog, are you sort of increasingly forcing cancellation versus just allowing customers to push out shipments? I guess if you want to bring down backlog, one quick way to do that, force them to cancel versus just allowing them to push things out. Thanks. A - Ganesh Moorthy: You know, we're not intentionally trying to bring backlog down. We are trying to help customers who have backlog placed on us, but would prefer to receive it, in some cases, later than what it’s presently scheduled for. Backlog will – over time has been coming down, as the fever of what was in 2022 and 2021, where people are placing huge amounts of backlog out in time. It starts to settle out, especially at these time are starting to come in. As the industry starts to normalize, backlog will get back to what it used to be normally, pre-COVID, and so that's really what's happening with backlog. We're not trying to force it down in any way. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. And then just as a quick follow-up, in China – do you think any of the weakness in China – are you seeing examples of locally sourced product that you're being displaced by? I know that you don't have very much exposure there. If you net out the proprietary stuff, it's probably only 5% that's kind of subject to some sort of going local, but are you seeing any of that? Thanks. A - Ganesh Moorthy: In fact, it's a timely question. We just had a review with our China team here yesterday on exactly that topic, and there is little to no loss to the local China producers that we're able to see, either in design or in things that are in production today. So no, it is actual consumption that is weak. There is a lot of uncertainty in China with respect to what the amount of debt people are carrying are, what kind of stimulus is going to take place. And I think there is a consumption that is waiting to happen, and I hope it will open up at some point in time. But at the moment, I think things are uncertain enough that consumption is being held down. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you so much. Thanks. Ganesh Moorthy: Welcome. Operator: Our next question is going to come from William Stein with Truist. Your line is open. William Stein : Great. Thank you. I wanted to address the similar question about cancellations that we understand with the PSP and the NCNRs, you've been much more flexible, at least somewhat flexible on rescheduling, but much less so on cancelling, which I think we all respect. But when we look at the growth rates of a wide variety of competitors, they've seen this downturn. Operator: Okay, William Stein's line has disconnected as well. So, our next question is going to come from Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital. Your line is open. Janet Ramkissoon: Hi Steve, Ganesh. There’s somewhat of a different tone for this question. Could you provide a little bit of color on your efforts with the RISC-V and the PolarFire SoC FPGA program? Anything you could share with us about design-win activity and markets where you're gaining traction with this program? And any sense of when we're likely to see any real revenue growth from this area? My understanding is that there's a lot of interest in RISC-V for embedded applications. Ganesh Moorthy: Sure. Thank you, Janet. So, we were among the very early proponent of using RISC-V for our FPGA solutions as you mentioned. Those products have been in production. They are ramping. In fact, the PolarFire family as you mentioned it, it's the fastest-growing FPGA that we have, if you look like-for-like, what is it doing after X amount of quarters and where it's at. It is winning in the traditional markets that FPGA, that came to us from Microsemi was winning, which is in aerospace and defense, some in the communication space. But also increasingly it is winning quite significantly in industrial, and it is winning in some automotive applications as well. So quite broadly present, it is doing exceedingly well. It is contributing to the results that we have been quoting on FPGA, both last quarter for the fiscal year and this quarter to reflect that it is hitting new records every quarter, and we are very, very optimistic about how RISC-V based FPGAs, along with all of the other elements that we have integrated on the solution, is going to play out.And it will be a huge growth driver for Microchip. Steve Sanghi : Good to hear from you Janet. This is Steve. Janet Ramkissoon: Hi. Nice to hear from you Steve. But just one quick follow-up if I may. Given the capability that is made possible by this new architecture, and its ability to integrate analog and digital functionality in a very effective way, shouldn't this also be, have positive implications for gross margins on these products above corporate average? Ganesh Moorthy: So, I wouldn't place the RISC-V architecture as the reason for the gross margin or the performance of the product line. The product line is an enormously complex product. It comes with lots of software, lots of tools, a lot of application information that we put together. How we put it all together and turn it from a complex capability to an easy-to-use solution is what determines design wins, revenue growth, gross margins, customer adoption, etcetera. So it’s much, much more than anything about RISC-V alone or any other core for that matter. Steve Sanghi : The product line's gross margins are definitely well above corporate average, but as Ganesh said, they are not because of the RISC-V. It's because of the overall architecture of the FPGA, the tools, the value we provide, and the markets we sell into. Janet Ramkissoon: Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it. Ganesh Moorthy: Great. You're welcome. Were we able to get Will back? Operator: Yes. William Stein, your line is open again. William Stein : Great. I'll try to do a shorter preamble and just say, Microchip is clearly experiencing this down cycle later than others. I think it's pretty clear it's because you've had these – the PSP and other flavors of NCNR, and you've been clear that you're allowing customers to reschedule and not so flexible on the cancellations. If we look at number guidance, I'm guessing that if you told every customer that wanted to reschedule or cancel, no, then you would have had higher revenue or had higher guidance. Likewise, if you allowed everyone to... Operator: Unfortunately, it looks like his line has dropped again. Steve Sanghi : We have no idea why the lines are dropping. Will can just call us back after the call, and we'll take his question. Ganesh Moorthy: Where there other questions or other callers that are still in the queue? Operator: No, there are no more questions in queue. Steve Sanghi : Close it out then. Ganesh Moorthy: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for attending today and for your questions. And we have follow-up meetings with many of you as well. But I look forward to talking to you either at those calls or in the many events we will be at during the course of this quarter. So, thank you.]"

I will now turn the call over to today's host, Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer of Microchip. You may begin.James Eric BjornholtGood afternoon, everybody. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of our operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliation on our website. Net sales in the June quarter were $2.289 billion, which was up 2.5% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record at 68.4%. Operating expenses were at 20.3% and operating income was a record 48.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $905.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basis was a record $1.64. On a GAAP basis in the June quarter, gross margins were a record at 68.1%. Total operating expenses were $655.3 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $151.5 million, special charges of $1.7 million, share-based compensation of $37.7 million and a benefit of $0.4 million for other matters. GAAP net income was a record $666.4 million resulting in a record $1.21 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 14.2% in the June quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be about 14%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal '24 cash tax rate is expected to be higher than our fiscal '23 tax rate for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes such as nonoperating losses, tax credits, lower tax depreciation and our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal '24, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&amp;D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&amp;D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If that were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2023, was $1.336 billion. We had 167 days of inventory at the end of the June quarter, which was down 2 days from the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory days in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked to as we accommodated requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. We also continue to invest in building inventory for products with long life and high margins, whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-lifed by our supply chain partners and these last-time buys represented 8 days of inventory at the end of June. We expect dollars and days of inventory on our balance sheet to reduce in the September quarter. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter -- excuse me, in the June quarter was at 29 days, which was up 5 days from the prior quarter's level. Compared to our other regions, inventory at our Asia distributors grew the most in the quarter as sell-through activity was down significantly on a sequential basis in this region, heavily driven by unfavorable business conditions in China. Our cash flow from operating activities was $993.2 million in the June quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $106.1 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $776 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $271.2 million. We paid down $413 million of total debt in the June quarter and our net debt was reduced by $450.2 million. Over the last 20 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $6.76 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buybacks to bring down this debt. In the June quarter, we retired $1 billion in bonds that matured using our line of credit to do so. Our line of credit had $725 million of borrowings against it at June 30, 2023 after paying off the $1 billion in bonds. During the June quarter, we also retired $38 million of total principal amount of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible bonds for a total cash payment of $90.1 million. The amount paid above the principal amount essentially works like a synthetic stock buyback reducing any current and future share count dilution that will result if these convertible bonds were ever converted into shares. The over $50 million we paid above the par value for the convertible bonds was in addition to our normal share buyback activity that we executed during the quarter, resulting in an additional reduction in the diluted shares outstanding. Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was a record at $1.172 billion and 51.2% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $4.473 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.29 at June 30, 2023, down from 1.45 at March 31, 2023, and down from 2.05 at June 30, 2022. Capital expenditures were $111.1 million in the June quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $400 million as we still have a lot of equipment that was ordered with long lead times that we will be receiving over the next year. We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us with increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $50.5 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter as well as our guidance for the September quarter. Ganesh?Story continuesGanesh MoorthyThank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results were strong in the context of a slowing macro environment, marked by our continued disciplined execution as well as our resilient end markets and diversified customer base. Net sales grew 2.5% sequentially at 16.6% on a year-over-year basis to achieve another all-time record of $2.29 billion. The June quarter represented our 11th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins were both records at 68.4% and 48.1%, respectively. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64 per share, another record by a whisker, and up 19.7% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was a record 51.2% of net sales and adjusted free cash flow was 33.9% of net sales in the June quarter, continuing to demonstrate the robust cash generation characteristics of our business. Our net leverage exiting June dropped to 1.29x. We returned $349.2 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the June quarter, representing 67.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow. Our capital return to shareholders in the September quarter will increase to 72.5% of our June quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. My profuse thanks to all our stakeholders who enabled us to achieve these outstanding results despite the increasingly challenging macro environment, and especially to the worldwide Microchip team, whose tireless efforts and agility to adapt are what enable us to navigate effectively through the business cycles. Taking a look at our June quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed-signal microcontroller net sales set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 0.8% in the June quarter and up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our analog net sales also set another all-time record, coming in sequentially up 2.5% in the June quarter and up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. Our FPGA net sales, which we comment on from time to time, had another record quarter with annualized revenue growth continuing to be in the double digits. Now for some color on the June quarter. While our overall business remains steady, our customers continue to feel the effects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty. Starting in early June, we saw business conditions deteriorate in 3 areas. First, our China business was much weaker than our expectations and has not recovered from the shutdowns of last year and the Lunar New Year holidays in the March quarter. This manifested in weak sell-through activity and the building of inventory in the distribution channel in China. Second, we started to see initial signs of weakness and uncertainty in the automotive and industrial segments, reflecting the impact of high inflation and high interest rates driving more cautious spending. And third, we are seeing early signs of an impending slowdown in Europe, exacerbated by some of our European customers being dependent on exports to countries like China, whereas we noted, the business environment is much weaker than expected. As a result, we continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers sought to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and increased uncertainty they were experiencing. We were able to push out meaningful amounts of non-reschedulable backlog to later quarters to help many customers with inventory positions. While the rate of cancellation and pushout requests appears to be stabilizing, we expect requests to push out or cancel backlog will likely be with us through the rest of calendar 2023 as customers adjust to the new demand environment and attempt to derisk their inventory position commensurately. We are also seeing an increase in direct and indirect impact from the cumulative effect of U.S. export control actions, especially in China. These actions were less of an issue over the last few quarters when demand was significantly higher than supply, but are more of an issue now as demand and supply come more into balance. Despite all the factors mentioned so far, in the June quarter, we were able to reverse the growth in days of inventory on our balance sheet, with inventory dropping by 2 days to 167 days, of which 8 days of inventory were from an investment in last-time buys of high-margin, long-life products whose manufacturing capacity was being end-of-lifed by our supply chain. Reflecting the slowing macro environment, especially in China, our channel inventory grew by 5 days to 29 days. We continue to take actions to further reduce the days of inventory on our balance sheet while maintaining absorption in our internal wafer fabrication factories. We're also working with our channel partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve customers and to be positioned for an eventual strengthening of business conditions. Finally, while our overall inventory is still a bit higher than our target, we made excellent progress to position our inventory at the best locations in manufacturing to be able to rapidly respond to demand growth when the macro environment strengthens. Consistent with the slowing macro environment and the higher than target level of inventory on our balance sheet as well as with some of our customers and channel partners, most of our internal factory expansion actions remain paused. This we expect will result in lower capital investments in fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25. During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe shorter lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed on us. We have been able to reduce average lead time from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly 26 weeks by the end of the June quarter. And we expect to continue to drive lead times down further in the coming months. We have heard concerns from some of the investment community about falling lead times because it results in lower backlog. While this is often true, we believe the level of backlog does not equate to true end market consumption. And in the final analysis, shorter lead times enable our customers and Microchip to navigate an uncertain environment with agility and more effectively. Now let's get into the guidance for the September quarter. Although our backlog for the September quarter is strong, we are continuing to take active steps to help customers with inventory positions to push out their backlog. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the September quarter to be between up 1% and down 3% sequentially. At the midpoint of our net sales guidance for the September quarter, our year-over-year growth for the quarter would be 9.3%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 68.3% and 68.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 20.1% and 20.5% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 47.8% and 48.4% of sales. And we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.60 and $1.64. At the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, our year-over-year growth for the September quarter would be 11% despite a much higher tax rate than the year ago quarter. As supply and demand come into balance, we expect normal seasonality to return to our business. Historically, the December quarter has been our seasonally weakest quarter. This year, we expect that our normal seasonality in the December quarter will likely be amplified by the macro weakness and business uncertainty that our customers are experiencing. As a result, we anticipate further business headwinds in the December quarter. However, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the markets and applications we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market mega trends continues to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. Finally, as you can see from our June quarter results and our September quarter guidance, our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we launched 21 months ago, continues to be the foundation of our results as we continue to build and improve what we believe is one of the most diversified, defensible, high-growth, high-margin, high-cash-generating businesses in the semiconductor industry. However, we recognize that we operate in a cyclical industry and that we're not immune to the business cycle. If you review Microchip's peak to trough performance through the business cycles over the last 15-plus years, which is included in the investor presentation posted on our website, you will observe our robust and consistent cash generation gross margin and operating margin results. Although we don't know what exactly the future holds, if we were to experience a semiconductor inventory correction, like what the industry has seen in the past, we are highly confident that our non-GAAP operating margins will remain well above 40% and we expect our cash generation, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin to once again demonstrate consistency and resiliency through the cycle. And with that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?Stephen SanghiThank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to reflect on our financial results announced today and provide you further updates on our cash return strategy. Reflecting on our financial results, I continue to be very proud of all employees of Microchip that have delivered another exceptional quarter while making new records in many respects, namely record net sales, record non-GAAP gross margin percentage, record non-GAAP operating margin percentage, record non-GAAP EPS and record adjusted EBITDA. And all of that in a continuing challenging environment. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 36.2% from the year ago quarter to $0.41 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $140.3 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $208.9 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $349.2 million. This amount was 67.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $517.3 million during the March 2023 quarter. Our paydown of debt as well as record adjusted EBITDA drove down our net leverage at the end of June 2023 quarter to 1.29x from 2.05x at the end of June 2022. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $2.686 billion to shareholders through June 30, 2023, by a combination of dividends and stock buybacks. In the current September quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the June quarter to target the cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $106.1 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the June quarter was $776 million. We plan to return 72.5% of, or $562.6 million, of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $223 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $339.6 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase free cash flow return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. This will take 6 more quarters and dividends over time we expect will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned. With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is going to come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.Tore Egil SvanbergI was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your orders. I mean backlog and the backlog, that all make sense. But I was just wondering if you could update us on orders, especially by region. And are you seeing any sort of signs of life at all from China? Because obviously, they are trying to stimulate the economy. And I'm just wondering if you've seen any data points there at all?Ganesh MoorthyI think going through the month of July, we have not yet seen China recover. There are discussions, I understand, about things they may do in the rest of this quarter. Those have yet to be seen. So I don't have anything more to add with respect to China. Our bookings have been weak. We do expect in time that those will begin to strengthen. There is still a lot of backlog that we're carrying and we are pushing out backlog. So there's not an immediate requirement for bookings to spring back to where they used to be.James Eric BjornholtMaybe I can just add to that. Bookings are a reflection of where lead times are. And with lead times coming down, the customers just aren't viewing that they need to put the backlog in place because our lead times are falling pretty rapidly.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.Vijay Raghavan RakeshJust a question. I was wondering, when you look at your supply chain, where are you seeing any -- what are you seeing on the pricing side, if you were to look at China or just globally?Ganesh MoorthySupply chains are stable in most places where we buy wafers from, where we buy some of our assembly and test services from. Clearly, on some of the materials, there may have been some movement in certain cases. I don't think we track it at the level that perhaps you may be interested in. But I would say supply chains are stable, lead times have come down, we're able to get what we need.Vijay Raghavan RakeshGot it. And in general, if you look at trends as you look out on the pricing side, any thoughts you could share? I mean what has been trends? And what do you see in the last 2, 3 years and how you see that going forward? I guess that's it.Ganesh MoorthyIn our business, for the embedded solutions business, pricing tends to be a lot more stable. Pricing is something you establish at the point of doing your new design-in activity, not at the point at which you're fulfilling demand that's coming in. And outside of the last 2 years where there was significant inflation that we faced and that we passed on to our customers, pricing is usually relatively stable over time. We're not looking to reduce pricing or to increase pricing. And as we go forward, I don't expect that is going to change in the way that our business runs.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.Vivek AryaSort of a multipart but related, Ganesh. When I look at the September quarter outlook, it's kind of flattish even though you're describing the situation as getting somewhat tougher. And then as I look out to the December quarter, I think you mentioned it could be worse than seasonal. But even with the headwinds, do you see a scenario where Microchip could continue to grow year-on-year? Or you think we should be thinking about the first quarter of year-on-year declines? And if they were to, right, decline year-on-year, what would be the effect on gross margins?Ganesh MoorthyWe haven't modeled what the December quarter nor are we guiding to what the December quarter is going to be. There are a range of scenarios that we are working with. And I don't really have any more color to offer on it. With respect to the gross margins, as we have said many times, we have a pretty strong resilience to the way the gross margin works. If you look at our inside outside mix, we still have a 60% outside mix. We are continuing to run our fabs -- where, for absorption purposes, we are building the product that we need to build and building some inventory. So really, I'm not trying to provide any guidance for December that you might have. But you're absolutely right. We are expecting that the December quarter is going to be weaker than normal seasonality.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.Ambrish SrivastavaI wanted to ask about automotive and industrial. Industrial has weakened for some of your competitors for quite a few quarters and auto continues to be strong, more or less, although the growth rate seems to be decelerating? What's your take on navigating through several cycles? We just started here and lead times are contracting, so how many quarters do you think the weakness in autos, and for that matter, industrial business, we should expect to last?Ganesh MoorthyIt's very difficult for me to answer that question. There is a question of which part of this is just inventory digestion that's taking place and how much of it is consumption changes and how consumption changes might change? So just using China as the example, China consumption was weak or weaker than anyone expected in the June quarter. How does it come back in the September or December quarter is anybody's guess on where it's at. So I don't have a clear view of how long does automotive or industrial stay weak. We've gone through many cycles. They don't last forever, obviously, and there are some typical cycles you can look back on and see how they performed.Ambrish SrivastavaTrue. Just had a quick follow-up, Ganesh. I'm struggling with the R part of the NCNR. What's the learning here? Has it allowed you to reduce the volatility that usually used to occur when we were going into a downturn? Because you keep rescheduling these. I shouldn't say keep -- a couple of quarters, you've rescheduled these, then you expect another reschedule next quarter. What's the right way investors should think about this? Because we've seen NCNRs by many companies and so I don't know what's the learning from this.Ganesh MoorthyWell, the purpose of the NCNR was to get a mutual commitment of investment we were going to make and benefit a customer was going to get. It's based on a set of assumptions about where business is going to go. And I think as lead times go farther and farther out, everybody's visibility gets to be less clear. And the vast majority of the customers who were part of the NCNR programs have been extremely happy with what they were able to get in an extremely (inaudible) environment in 2021 and 2022. No program is perfect. I believe that our programs have had substantially more benefit than issues with them. We're at a point of the cycle where the demand curve has changed. And as that demand curve changes, we have to adjust. And by the way, the same demand curve will change again as we go into 2024. So I think we have to look beyond a short-term view of where this all ends up and look at how do these programs provide mutual benefit in the medium to long term.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question is going to come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreI guess you're describing an environment in which you're seeing weakness in multiple regions, weakness in multiple end markets and you're characterizing that as kind of early signs of that. And yet you're only guiding down 1% quarter-on-quarter. So I guess it's like [see] a level of demand that's lower than this? I mean you have a lot of backlog right now. What happens as that backlog runs out? Can you just give us a sense for what type of drawdown we might be looking at over the course of the next few quarters? Just anything qualitative you can help us with that would be great.Ganesh MoorthyWe call it as we see it. We've given you a guidance for September quarter that brackets between plus 1% and minus 3%, and that reflects what we see today in our backlog and what we see in the tone of the business. We're giving you a sense that the December quarter is going to be seasonally weaker than normal. And again, it has a number of puts and takes that could go into it. I don't know what more I can say, Joe. It's the best that we're able to peer into the future and provide some insight as to where we think business is going.Joseph Lawrence MooreI can appreciate that. And then in terms of the 40% operating margin, can you give us a sense for what the parameters are of that? Like how much -- is that kind of a normal revenue weakness that you might have seen 2 or 3 years ago? If -- could you still do a north of 40% if it's worse than that? Can you just give us a sense for your confidence in the durability of that number?Ganesh MoorthyOur confidence is pretty high. We have looked at a number of scenarios. We've looked at how other cycles have gone and I think we'll be well above 40% in the way that we have modeled it in the different scenarios that we have brought. Eric, do you want to add more to it?James Eric BjornholtYes. I think you've summed it up well, Ganesh. We've done scenario planning and do not see a scenario where our operating margins on a non-GAAP basis could fall below 40%. So we're very comfortable in making that statement. Maybe the other piece that I would add to Ganesh's first response is I think it's a little bit tricky for investors to understand what is normal seasonality for Microchip because of the supply constraints we've been under for the last couple of...(technical difficulty) Seasonality didn't play a part in that. And then we've done a lot of acquisitions historically, right? But we would say that probably a normal December seasonal might be down 3% or 4%. So hopefully, that provides some context and we're saying that based on the conditions that we're seeing, it likely could be -- what's the word, Ganesh? Yes, amplified.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.Joshua Louis BuchalterIn the past, you've thought -- you've sort of given us rough levels of where you expected inventory to come in, in the quarter. I guess given we're going through this digestion period, can you give us any level that you would feel comfortable with? What sort of targets are you thinking about for on books and in the channel, when you would feel more comfortable that you're shipping closer to end demand?Ganesh MoorthyI think the channel inventory is driven by in part what the channel wants to carry, what we can supply and what their demand intensity is. So we don't try to guide where the channel inventory is going to go. It goes where it goes based on those factors. We do take a lot of effort on the internal inventory inside Microchip. And we have an added factor at this point, which is we are trying...(technical difficulty) Customers who have inventory positions and are looking for pushout help. And that has caused us to go slower than we would normally have liked, but it's the right long-term answer for us and for our customers. And we do expect, as Eric said, to have both a reduction in absolute and days of inventory on our balance sheet in the September quarter.Joshua Louis BuchalterI appreciate the color there. And as my follow-up, I mean given that dynamic, your gross margin suggests that there's no real material cut, at least on your internal utilization rates. Can you talk about how you're thinking about running your factories through this period of digestion? And I guess the same question for your foundry partners as well.Ganesh MoorthySure. So our internal fabs are continuing to run relatively unchanged. These products are very long-lived products, in many cases, had been depleted in the inventory points that we typically need to be able to serve at a high level of certainty as well as the lead times we want. So our internal factories and the internal fabs in particular, are continuing to run. And our foundry partners, depending on where the inventory levels were, in some cases, we will be adjusting and have adjusted the purchasing to bring that inventory into line with where we want to be long term.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.Christopher CasoFirst question is about, so I guess something we haven't spoken about in a while, the potential for the requirement for turns? And can you speak about that given the reduction in lead times, the fact that customers are booking closer -- I know we had a situation...Ganesh MoorthyChris, we may have lost you. Can you hear us?OperatorIt looks like Chris' line has dropped. So until he calls back, we'll just move on to the next person in queue. And that's going to be Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan L. SurThe team had a target to get average lead times down to 26 weeks in the second half. I mean you're there now, given the scheduling activity, kind of near-term demand weakness, improving foundry capacity, right? I think normal average historical lead times for you guys have been in that 8- to 12-week range. Is this that kind of a range that you expect as you move to the second half of the year now? And just a quick follow-up. Do you guys expect to see your channel distribution inventories continue to rise from the 29-day level in this weak environment?Ganesh MoorthySo first to take the lead times. We are continuing to drive lead times down. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that short lead times is what makes us all effective and agile in an unpredictable business environment that we're in. And we're on average, at just under 26 weeks right now. I think we will end the year at well under 13 weeks, could be under 10 weeks by that time. But we'll know how we progress in that time. 4 to 8 weeks is where our [up] lead times are for 90% or so of our line items as a historical benchmark for where we were. With respect to distribution inventory, as I mentioned a little earlier on, it has many functions. It's a function of what kind of sell-through are they seeing, what kind of inventory do they want to carry, what are we able to supply that maybe they've been asking for some time to be able to do it. So I don't have any color on what distribution inventory is likely to be doing outside of what we've provided so far for June. Chris, are you back?OperatorYes. Chris Caso, your line is open again.Christopher CasoYes. Not sure what happened, but thank you. So the question was on the turns environment. It's obviously, you haven't seen turns in several quarters given the high backlog. Is that something you contemplate either for the September quarter and December quarter? And can you tell us how you're thinking about that, the turns business, under the context of shortening lead time?Ganesh MoorthyYes. We certainly expect that turns will be a requirement as we go into the December quarter. And it's a normal part of the business that we have done with. And so most things are starting to normalize again with respect to lead times, what kind of backlog coverage we'll have and turns is just something else we'll have to manage as we normally do, starting from the December quarter onwards.Christopher CasoOkay. But it starts in December, not in September?Ganesh MoorthyThere may have been small parts in the September quarter. And we're 1/3 of the way in through the September quarter.Christopher CasoRight, right. That's helpful. As a follow-up, I wonder if you could expand on some of the comments about Europe. And we've heard from various others in the industry, obviously, weakness about China. There's been a bit here and there about industrial and auto, but really, not any comments about Europe. That's something new. And if you can expand upon what you're seeing there?Ganesh MoorthyYes. As I mentioned, I think Europe is more -- as I look forward, there are more headwinds that European economies are facing. I believe technically, Germany is now in a recession. It's had 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP. And interest rates are still high. Inflation is still high. There's energy inflation, which is larger than in the U.S. And some of the large European economies rely on export, China being one. And to the extent China is weak, we're going to see some of that weakness in China, but we'll also see some of the weakness in Europe, when their exports are not quite that. So that's the addition of all of what we see as we look into where are things going and the impact from Europe.Christopher CasoThat's helpful. And thank you for coming back to my question.Ganesh MoorthyYou're welcome. Thanks, Chris, and welcome back.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.Timothy Michael ArcuriI had a question on cancellations. And in the past or you've been working with customers on allowing pushouts, but in the past, you sort of -- you've been offering customers to cancel for a fee. So if you want to bring down backlog, are you sort of increasingly forcing cancellation versus just allowing customers to push out shipments? I guess if you want to bring down backlog, 1 quick way to do that -- force them to cancel versus just allowing them to push things out.Ganesh MoorthyWe're not intentionally trying to bring backlog down. We are trying to help customers who have backlog placed on us, but would prefer to receive it, in some cases, later than what it's presently scheduled for. Backlog will, over time, has been coming down as the fever of what was in 2022 and 2021, where people were placing huge amounts of backlog out in time, starts to settle out, especially as these times starting to come in, as the industry starts to normalize, backlog will get back to what it used to be normally, pre-COVID. And so that's really what's happening with backlog. We're not trying to force it down in any way.Timothy Michael ArcuriAnd then just as a quick follow-up. In China, do you think any of the weakness in China, are you seeing examples of locally-sourced product that is being -- that you're being displaced by? I know that you don't have very much exposure there. If you net out the proprietary stuff, it's probably only 5% that's kind of subject to some sort of going local. But are you seeing any of that?Ganesh MoorthyIn fact, it's a timely question. We just had a review with our China team here yesterday on exactly that topic. And there is little to no loss to the local China producers that we're able to see, either in design or in things that are in production today. So no, it is actual consumption that is weak. There is a lot of uncertainty in China with respect to what the amount of debt people are carrying are, what kind of stimulus is going to take place. And I think there is a consumption that is waiting to happen and I hope it will open up at some point in time. But at the moment, I think things are uncertain enough that consumption is being held down.OperatorOur next question is going to come from William Stein with Truist.William SteinI wanted to address the similar question about cancellations, that we understand with PSP and the NCNRs, you've been much more flexible, at least somewhat flexible on rescheduling, but much less so on canceling, which I think we all respect. But when we look at the growth rate of a wide variety of competitors, they've seen this downturn in...OperatorOkay. William Stein's line has disconnected as well. So our next question is going to come from Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital.Janet RamkissoonSteve, Ganesh, there is somewhat of a different tone over this question. Could you provide a little bit of color on your efforts with RISC-V and the PolarFire SoC FPGA program? Anything you could share with us about design win activity, end markets where you're gaining traction with this program? And any sense where we're likely to -- any sense of when we're likely to see any real revenue growth from this area? My understanding is that there's a lot of interest in RISC-V for embedded applications.Ganesh MoorthySure. Thank you, Janet. So we were among the very early proponents of using RISC-V for our FPGA solutions, as you mentioned. Those products have been in production. They are ramping. In fact, the PolarFire family, as you mentioned it, it's the fastest-growing FPGA that we have. If you look like-for-like, what is it doing after X amount of quarters and where it's at? It is winning in the traditional markets that FPGA -- that came to us from Microsemi was winning, which is in aerospace and defense, some in the communications space, but also increasingly, it is winning quite significantly in industrial and it is winning in some automotive applications as well. So quite broadly present. It is doing exceedingly well. It is contributing to the results that we have been quoting on FPGA, both last quarter for the fiscal year and this quarter to reflect that it is hitting new records every quarter. And we are very, very optimistic about how RISC-V based FPGAs, along with all of the other elements that we have integrated on the solution, is going to play out. And it will be a huge growth driver for Microchip.Stephen SanghiGood to hear from you, Janet. This is Steve.Janet RamkissoonNice to hear from you, too, Steve. But just 1 quick follow-up, if I may. Given the capability that is made possible by this new architecture and its ability to integrate analog and digital functionality in a very effective way, shouldn't this also be -- you have positive implications for gross margins on these products, above corporate average?Ganesh MoorthySo I wouldn't place the RISC-V architecture as the reason for the gross margin or the performance of the product line. The product line is an enormously complex product, comes with lots of software, lots of tools, a lot of application information that we put together. How we put it all together and turn it from a complex capability to an easy-to-use solution is what determines design wins, revenue growth, gross margin adoption, et cetera. So it's much, much more than anything about RISC-V or any other core for that matter.Stephen SanghiThe product lines' gross margins are definitely well above corporate average, but as Ganesh said, they're not because of the RISC-V. It's because of the overall architecture of the FPGA, the tools, the value we provide in the markets we sell into.Ganesh MoorthyDid we -- were we able to get Will back?OperatorYes. William Stein, your line is open again.William SteinI'll try to do a shorter preamble and just say Microchip has clearly experiencing this down cycle later than others. I think it's pretty clear it's because you've had these -- the PSP and other flavors of NCNR and you've been clear that you're allowing customers to reschedule and not so flexible on the cancellations. If we look at number guidance, I'm guessing that if you told every customer that wanted to reschedule or cancel, no, then you would have had higher revenue, or rather, higher guidance. Likewise, if you allowed everyone to...OperatorUnfortunately, it looks like his line has dropped again.Stephen SanghiWe have no idea why the lines are dropping. Will can just call us back after the call and we'll take his question.Ganesh MoorthyWere there other questions or other callers that are still in the queue?OperatorNo, there are no more questions in queue.Ganesh MoorthyOkay. Well, thank you, everyone, for attending today and for your questions. And we have follow-up meetings with many of you as well. But I look forward to talking to you either at those calls or in the many events we will be at during the course of this quarter. So thank you.]"

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Verizon have declined -11.8% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s decline of -13.0%. The company’s continued retail prepaid and postpaid net losses are hindering its top-line growth. Stiff competition from other major players and saturation in the U.S. wireless market is hurting profits.Heavy spending on promotional activities to attract customers is also weighing on margins. It has reiterated its soft guidance for 2023 due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, Verizon is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum.It is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans that has led to solid customer additions. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products are tailwinds.

The company's first-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Jun 30) results show higher revenues, robust loans and deposit balance and a rise in provisions. Increased dependence on domestic loans, a rise in retail loan demand, higher interest rates and a stable funding base are expected to support the company's financials.Furthermore, efforts of digitizing banking operations will help generate non-interest income, thereby supporting revenue growth. However, weak asset quality remains a major near-term headwind. Macroeconomic concerns, including high inflation across the globe, make us apprehensive.Moreover, elevated operating expenses, mainly on the back of technology investments and ongoing branch expansion initiatives, will likely impede the bottom-line growth.(You can read the full research report on ICICI Bank here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Argentina-based MercadoLibre have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. -3.5%).

Increasing total payments volume (TPV), courtesy of the robust Mercado Pago, aided the company.MercadoLibre’s rising gross merchandise volume (GMV) remained another positive. Strong shipment growth also contributed well to the reported results. MercadoLibre is benefiting from strength in its commerce and fintech businesses. Further, robust mobile-point-of-sale business and growing adoption of MercadoPago are driving the TPV.Also, rapid adoption of Mobile Wallet remains a positive.

Listen insteadTo the long list of miseries being caused by the unrelenting extreme heat, add the recent dramatic spike in gas prices.Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, on July 31 reported that the abrupt rise in fuel prices starting the last week of July was due to heat-related outages at some of the nation's biggest refineries, causing inventories to fall to their lowest July level since 2015 during peak summer demand for gasoline.""In addition, oil prices surged to their highest level in months, rising to over $80 per barrel due to (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) releases coming to an end and concerns over cuts in supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia, the second and third largest oil producers in the world,"" he said. ""Motorists have seen average gasoline and diesel prices rise at the fastest pace in over a year, but the rise seen (the last week of July) should now start slowing.""According to AAA, the national average price of a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.83 as of Friday, with Texas being among the states with the lowest average prices. The cheapest gallon of regular available in Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen on Friday was $3.11, $3.39 and $3.34, respectively, according to GasBuddy.DeHaan warned that the approaching peak of hurricane season could make matters even worse.""Any new issues could easily push the national average over $4 per gallon for the first time in 2023,"" he said. ""Drivers may want to brace for potentially higher prices yet.""Refineries aren't built to operate in sustained temperatures over 95 degrees and are having to reduce the output of refined products for safety reasons, which further squeezes supply, according to industry experts. Meanwhile, four of the largest refineries in country are located along the Texas Gulf coast, which has been broiling under unrelenting heat for more than a month, along with the rest of the southern United States.Story continuesTemperatures in Houston are expected to hit at least 100 on eight of the next nine days. Baton Rouge, La., home to a large ExxonMobil refinery, is as hot as Houston if not slightly hotter.July ended with five straight weeks of gains in the oils markets, with oil prices almost 5 percent higher the last week of July compared to the week preceding it, DeHaan said. This was partly a result of worries over tight supply from OPEC Plus (the 13 OPEC nations plus 10 oil-producing, non-OPEC nations), but mostly Russia and Saudi Arabia, he said.The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil reached $83.24 early Friday afternoon tapering off. A barrel of Brent crude oil hit $86.65 before dropping during the same period Friday. Oil markets have lurched higher in recent days on news that Saudi Arabia plans to continue production into September that it began in July, DeHaan said.""With additional economic data looking healthy, the U.S. may be able to avoid a broad recession, adding to the sentiment that oil demand will be stronger as a result, putting the production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia front and center to the recent rally in oil,"" he said.]"

""In their madness, they need world food markets to collapse, they need a price crisis, they need disruptions in supplies.""The Kremlin's attacks came after it refused to extend a key grain deal held with Ukraine that helped secure safe passage for 33 million tons of crop exports since the deal was reached in July 2022.Meanwhile, Ukraine's drone strike adds a new threat to Russia's commodity outflows, which are already limited Western sanctions and price caps.The attack is unlikely to be a one-off event, drone-expert Stephen Wright told Insider, but only signals more to come. Ukraine is focusing on building bigger and more powerful sea drones, and wants to ""get more explosives on board"" to ramp up its attacks, he said.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Lipow Oil Associates President Andrew Lipow tells Yahoo Finance Live the move is ""very significant."" Lipow say the cuts ""really emphasize the point that they are looking for higher prices, because the domestic budgets of these OPEC+ countries simply could not last when oil was under $70 a barrel.""Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Oil prices rising for a sixth straight week. And today's gains driven by Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision to extend production cuts. Remaining OPEC plus members though deciding to keep output unchanged in a meeting today causing prices to rally further. It comes as extreme weather poses threats to US production.Let's bring in Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Andy, good to talk to you today. I'm looking at where oil prices are trading today-- oil futures, I should say, above that $80 a barrel mark. How supportive do you think these cuts announced by Saudi Arabia, as well as Russia will be in terms of price action?ANDREW LIPOW: Well, thanks for having me. I think these cuts are very significant. If we look back to October of last year, OPEC plus has cut over 5 million barrels a day from their production quotas. And these last voluntary cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia really emphasized the point that they're looking for higher prices because the domestic budgets of these OPEC plus countries simply could not last when oil was under $70 a barrel.- So Andy, do we expect to see oil hit $90 a barrel before the year is out?ANDREW LIPOW: I think there's a very good possibility, especially as we've seen Saudi Arabia take these proactive steps to get the price of oil higher. I think they'd be quite comfortable to see Brent crude oil prices at around $90 a barrel and WTI at about $85. But the market could move higher because OPEC plus tends to be reactive. And of course, as prices rise, they're certainly going to think it's in their benefit to keep those higher prices higher for a longer period of time without triggering a recession around the world.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Andy, what are the supply-demand dynamics looking like right now? You know, on the one hand, we've got the prices above $80 a barrel, you've got the Russian cuts taking shape more. And yet you look at the demand picture at least in China where the biggest market is, we just haven't seen the kind of pickup in economic activity.ANDREW LIPOW: Well, I think that their economic activity is lagging, but we do see in the physical oil market China is buying record amounts of crude oil and processing record amounts of that oil in their new refineries and existing refineries. So the oil market is seeing the demand. The latest cut of 500,000 barrels a day by Russia was actually impacting China at the most because China, India, Turkey, and Bulgaria have become the four main customers of that Russian oil. So it does look to me like inventories around the world are declining and supplies are getting tighter- Andy, I want to ask you about just the impact of heat. It's not something over the years-- I've covered crude oil and it's not something that's been often in the conversation when you're talking about oil prices, oil inventories. What is the impact of extreme weather on that market?ANDREW LIPOW: Well, there's a number of impacts. The first is that in the Middle East, we see them burning more crude oil for power generation to run their air conditioners during the summer. As far as refinery operations go, refineries, like people, do not like it when the heat index is 110 to 115. They simply can't have the equipment work as efficiently. And as a result, they're cutting their operating rates not only here in the Southern us, but in places like Greece and Italy where temperatures are even higher than what we see here in Texas.AKIKO FUJITA: So when you think about refineries having a breakdown, I mean this is already coming at a time when US inventory is low. To what extent is this-- as in the factor with the heat-- driving prices higher?ANDREW LIPOW: Well, it certainly exacerbates the problem along with these refinery unscheduled outages that we've seen around the coast, as well as in the Midwest. So as-- gasoline demand is increased about 3% over the last four weeks compared to last year and inventories are declining and makes for a mix of higher gasoline prices for the consumer- Andy, I want to ask you about this. I've seen the Biden administration delaying some plans to restock the emergency oil reserves. Given where prices are, they've canceled this planned purchase. The energy department canceling this, this week.So what does that say to you? Is that a good move? I mean, considering, especially given that you see WTI heading towards $85 a barrel, what's your thought on that?ANDREW LIPOW: I think that the Biden administration is very focused on gasoline prices because it's such a pocketbook issue. I think the fact that the administration canceled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve purchases of 3 million barrels a month, they're really very small in the scheme of the oil market. It's less than 100,000 barrels a day when world oil demand is over 100 million barrels a day.AKIKO FUJITA: Looking at gas prices right now, Andy, I'm looking at $3.80 right now a gallon. We have seen that number continue to tick up over the last few weeks. Are we going to see it push even higher going into year end or is this just something that we're seeing given the inventory picture right now?ANDREW LIPOW: Well, I think over the next couple of weeks, we could see gasoline prices tick a little bit higher. We've got the bulk of the hurricane season ahead of us in the Gulf of Mexico. But as we get into the winter months being October for the oil market, we see that refiners are able to make the cheaper grade of winter gasoline. And that would mitigate further price rises.- All right, Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Thank you so much, and have a great weekend, and try to stay cool in Texas.ANDREW LIPOW: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.]"

35,5038944b-f56c-32f3-8ec9-2483bf4617d4,CRM,2023-08-05,"Institutional owners may ignore Salesforce, Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) recent US$11b market cap decline as longer-term profits stay in the green",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-ignore-salesforce-110108833.html,1691233268,STORY,['CRM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Salesforce's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 81% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$11b last week. However, the 13% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Salesforce. See our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Salesforce, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Salesforce. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.5%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.7% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$6.4b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

36,9902edf4-f6dd-3367-8398-51e904414179,SEE,2023-08-05,Sealed Air (SEE) to Report Q2 Earnings: What to Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sealed-air-see-report-q2-161000210.html,1691165400,STORY,['SEE'],"[Sealed Air Corporation SEE is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 8 before the opening bell.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.42 billion, suggesting a 0.2% dip from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings is pinned at 68 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 32.7%.Q1 PerformanceSealed Air’s first-quarter 2022 earnings and sales decreased year over year. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the metrics. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.97%, on average.Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSealed Air Corporation price-eps-surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sealed Air this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Sealed Air has an Earnings ESP of -4.90%. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Key FactorsSealed Air has been witnessing a downtrend in overall volumes over the past five quarters. The volume decline has been more pronounced in the Protective segment where it was down 11% in 2022 and 18% in the first quarter of 2023. This reflects recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets. In the Food segment, volumes decreased 2% in 2022 and 2.6% in the first quarter of 2023. This was driven by food retail market declines and the impact of supply disruptions.We anticipate these factors, along with customer destocking, to have impacted volumes in the second quarter. Throughout the quarter, industry participants have noted that the supply chain-issues have been abating. Reflecting this, we expect the volume decline to moderate from the previous quarters.Our model projects the Food segment to witness a decline of 1% in volumes in the second quarter, which is an improvement from the 2.6% decline in the first quarter of 2023. For the Protective segment, our model factors in a volume decline of 13.8% in the second quarter, which suggests an improvement from the 22.5% decline in the first quarter of 2023.Our model estimate for the Food segment’s second-quarter net sales is $903.5 million, suggesting growth of 12% from the prior-year period’s reported figure. The impact of lower volumes is likely to have been offset by improved pricing (1.9%) and a 11.7% contribution from the recent Liquibox acquisition. Our estimate for the segment’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stands at $188 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 12%.Story continuesOur estimate for the Protective segment’s second-quarter net sales is $525 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 14%. This is mainly due to the volume decline of 13.8% which is likely to have offset the pricing growth of 1.2%. Our estimate for the segment’s adjusted EBITDA is $104.6 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 17%.Sealed Air’s overall volumes are expected to decline 6.5%, as per our model. We expect pricing growth of 1.6% in the quarter and a contribution of 6.6% from acquisitions. The company’s second-quarter performance is likely to have been supported by the sustained demand for packaging of food, beverage and healthcare products, and e-commerce activities.Savings from the company’s Reinvent SEE Strategy initiatives have been driving productivity gains and mitigating supply-chain challenges. This is expected to have driven the operating margin performance in the June-ended quarter. We expect the impact of inflationary costs (material, freight) to have lessened in the second quarter. However, the company has been increasing its R&amp;D investments in innovation and automation, which are anticipated to have weighed on its margins.Price PerformanceIn the past year, shares of Sealed Air have lost 21.4%, compared with the industry’s 1.5% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderHere are some Industrial Products stocks, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases.Tetra Tech TTEK has an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

Continued global demand for its comfort technology footwear is also yielding results.These strengths have aided the company post sturdy results for second-quarter 2023, with the top and bottom lines outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Results gained from strength in brands and demand for comfort technology products, aided by solid marketing and distribution capabilities.Also, continued broad-based strength globally, mainly in the DTC unit, further drove the performance. We note that sturdy demand for comfort technology footwear, enhanced in-store product availability and effective demand creation resulted in 29% growth.Markedly, shares of this footwear leader have appreciated 21.7%, outperforming the industry’s 9.9% decrease in the past six months. This upside run is buoyed by the aforesaid tailwinds.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s Dive DeeperSkechers has been directing resources to enhance its digital capabilities, including augmenting website features, mobile applications and a loyalty program. Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are likely to drive greater sales.

Initiatives such as “Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store” and “Buy Online, Pickup at Curbside” are worth mentioning.The company has concluded the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor. We note that the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor has helped Skechers build its brand in the Nordic region with stores and e-commerce platforms, and a network of wholesale customers in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.Management also remains focused on store expansion. In the second quarter of 2023, management opened 50 company-owned stores while closing 39 stores. Store openings consisted of 28 in China, eight of which were transferred from franchise to company-owned, eight big box stores in the United States, and three each in Chile and Vietnam. Also, it added 56 Skechers outlets in four Nordic countries and two stores in Germany from the acquisition of the company’s Scandinavian distributor.Story continuesThird quarter to date, the company has introduced two company-owned stores in the United States, and one each in Colombia and Chile. For the rest of the year, it intends to open 90-100 company-owned stores worldwide.Furthermore, Skechers’ international business remains a significant sales growth driver. SKX is poised to enhance its global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and joint ventures. In the last reported quarter, international sales increased 17.9% year over year, accounting for 60% of the overall sales for the quarter.What Else?For 2023, management believes to accomplish sales between $7.95 billion and $8.1 billion, compared with the earlier view of $7.9-$8.1 billion and $7.44 billion recorded last year. It envisions earnings per share (EPS) between $3.25 and $3.40 versus the prior expectation of $3.00-$3.20 and $2.38 delivered last year. Management expects the acquisition of the Scandinavia distributor deal to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2023. The company looks forward to achieving its goal of $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.Analysts seem optimistic about the stock.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Guy Baber, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Guy Baber: Thank you, Danielle, and thank you as well to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Yesterday, after the close, we issued a press release, a slide presentation and investor packet that address our second quarter 2023 results. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, Executive VP and CFO; Pat Wagner, Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy; and Mike Henderson, Executive VP of Operations. As a reminder, today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as the risk factors described in our SEC filings. We'll also reference certain non-GAAP terms in today's discussion, which have been reconciled and defined in our earnings materials. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee and the rest of the team who will provide prepared remarks today. After the completion of these remarks, we'll move to a question-and-answer session. Lee?Lee Tillman: Thank you, Guy, and good morning to everyone listening to our call today. First, I want to again kick off our call by expressing my thanks to our employees and contractors for another quarter of comprehensive execution against our framework for success. We don't take such delivery for granted, and I'm especially grateful for your commitment to safety and environmental excellence in addition to delivering on all of our operational and financial objectives. Well done on another great quarter, while staying true to our core values. There are a few takeaways I want to leave you all with this morning. First, we delivered another very strong quarter on all fronts, highlighted by sequential increases to our cash flow from operations, free cash flow and our total company oil and oil-equivalent production.Story continuesWe delivered around $530 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, with a significant increase from first quarter driven by strong execution and improving production trend and a catch-up in EG cash distributions. Second key takeaway. We continue to lead our peer group and the broader S&amp;P 500 in returning capital to our shareholders. During second quarter, we returned $434 million to shareholders, including $372 million of share repurchases. Through the first half of 2023, we've returned over $830 million to our shareholders, representing 40% of our top line cash flow from operations consistent with our framework. Our differentiated cash flow-driven return of capital framework continues to prioritize our shareholders as the first call on our cash flow, not the drill bit and non inflation.First half 2023 return of capital represents a double-digit total shareholder distribution yield on an annualized basis and the highest in our E&amp;P peer space. Our commitment and consistency and returning significant capital is contributing to peer-leading growth in our per share metrics. We've now reduced our outstanding share count by 24% in just the last 7 quarters, and we are on track to deliver 30% year-over-year production growth per share. Our third and final key takeaways this morning. Our forward outlook remains compelling and differentiated. We are on track to deliver a 2023 business plan that benchmarks at the top of our high-quality E&amp;P peer group on the metrics that matter most: shareholder distributions, free cash flow generation, reinvestment rate, capital efficiency, free cash flow breakeven and production growth per share.Our business plan remains on track with operational and financial momentum improving over the second half of the year. More specifically, our first half weighted capital spending and completion activity will drive our third quarter total company oil and oil equivalent production to at or above the high end of our annual guidance range. With both higher production and lower CapEx over the second half of 2023, we expect continued sequential improvement to our underlying free cash flow generation across the third and fourth quarters. And finally, to our annual production guidance ranges remain unchanged, our full year oil equivalent production is trending above the midpoint of that guidance. Looking ahead to 2024. While it's too early to share any specific guidance, rest assured that our framework for success and core priorities will remain unchanged.Our case debate will be another year of maintenance level oil production that maximizes our sustainable free cash flow and prioritizes shareholder distributions and per share growth. My expectation is that we will once again lead the peer group on the metrics that matter most in 2024, benefiting from any deflation that might present itself in the market, as well as from the added tailwind of a significant financial uplift in EG from our increased exposure to the global LNG market. With that, I'll turn it over to Dane, who will provide a brief financial update.Dane Whitehead: Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everyone. As we mentioned, second quarter was a tremendous financial quarter for us as we generated $531 million of adjusted free cash flow and returned $434 million of capital back to shareholders. That's a 10% increase in shareholder distributions relative to the first quarter. Importantly, we expect our financial delivery to improve even further over the second half of the year. On a price normalized basis, we expect our free cash flow generation to improve across the third and fourth quarters relative to the second quarter's already meaningful level, driven by higher expected production and lower capital spending consistent with the phasing of our 2023 program. Returning significant capital back to our shareholders remains foundational to our value proposition in the marketplace.We're focused on building a long-term track record of consistent shareholder returns through the cycle that can be measured in years, not just quarters, and the first half of 2023 represents another successful step in that journey. Through the first 2 quarters of the year, we returned over $830 million to shareholders, representing 40% of our adjusted CFO. First half return of capital translates to a double-digit shareholder distribution yield on an annualized basis, and that's the highest in our peer group. Over the trailing 7 quarters, we've now returned approximately $4.6 billion back to shareholders. That's almost 30% of our current market capitalization that we've returned in less than 2 years. We repurchased $4.2 billion of our stock at attractive levels, driving a 24% reduction in our outstanding share count, contributing to pure leading growth in our per share metrics.We remain confident. Our cash flow-driven return of capital framework is uniquely advantaged versus peers, providing investors with first call on cash flow and offering them a differentiated shareholder return profile. Our framework is sector-leading and transparent, providing clear visibility to one of the strongest shareholder distribution yields in the entire S&amp;P 500. For the full year, we expect to continue to deliver against our framework, returning a minimum of 40% of our top line CFO to shareholders. We're committed to the powerful combination of a competitive and sustainable base dividend and material share repurchases. More or less our base dividend unchanged this quarter. Keep in mind that we've raised it basically last 11 quarters, and we're well positioned for another dividend raise later this year, with the increase expected to be fully funded by the share count reduction from our buyback program.This is consistent with our focus on sustainability and our objective to maintain one of the lowest post-dividend free cash flow breakevens in the peer space. Additionally, we have ample capacity to continue buying back a significant amount of our stock with $1.8 billion of share repurchase authorization outstanding. Our plan is to maintain our return of capital leadership and improve our already investment-grade balance sheet through gross debt reduction. We can do both, and that's exactly what we're demonstrating. We paid down $200 million of high-coupon U.S. debt so far this year and remarketed $200 million of tax in bonds at a favorable interest rate. The strength and durability of our shareholder return and balance sheet enhancement initiatives are underpinned by the quality of our assets, our disciplined capital allocation framework, our peer-leading capital efficiency and our strong free cash flow generation.This is proven out by our leadership position when it comes to the most important metrics for our sector. For full year 2023, we expect to deliver the best free cash flow yield in the high-quality E&amp;P space, the lowest reinvestment rate and among the best capital efficiency, all while maintaining the lowest enterprise free cash flow breakeven on a pre- and post-dividend basis. With that summary, I'll turn it over to Mike to provide a brief update of our 2023 execution that's delivering the sector-leading outcomes.See also 10 Best Oil Refinery Stocks to Buy and 15 Biggest Oil Refining Companies in the World.Michael Henderson: Thanks, Dane. My key message today is that the priorities for our capital program remain unchanged and that we remain fully on track to deliver on our key commitments to the market, including our annual capital spending and production guidance. Starting with our capital program, we spent just over 60% of our full year budget during the first half of the year, fully consistent with our stated business plan. We expect third quarter capital spending to be in the $400 million to $450 million range, with a further moderation expected in the fourth quarter and are well positioned to take advantage of any deflationary tailwind in the second half of the year. For the full year 2023, the midpoint of our annual capital guidance remains a reasonable assumption for your models.In terms of the service cost environment, first half 2023 pricing was very consistent with our expectations entering the year. We started to see a general plateauing of cost during the second quarter and had improved access to services and equipment. The macro environment remains dynamic. We've now started to see an improved pricing trend across raw materials and most service lines in equip, consistent with a lower level of industry-wide drilling and completion activity. We'll look to capture better pricing where we can with the balance of the year, while continuing to protect our execution excellence, where we are also seeing a number of positive trends. To that point, year-to-date, field-level execution has been very strong and efficiency outperformance has us tracking to the higher end of our annual wealth sales guidance in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian.While this won't have a material impact on our full year 2023 capital for production, it should enhance our production momentum into 2024, where we also believe there will be more opportunity to capture deflation in the market. Turning to production. The phasing of our capital program is driving strong production momentum into a strengthening commodity price environment. For third quarter specifically, we expect total company oil and oil equivalent production to be at or above the high end of our annual guidance range before a modest sequential decline into the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, we've reiterated our production guidance ranges of forward trending above the midpoint of guidance on an oil equivalent basis. The combination of higher production and lower capital spending over the second half of the year is expected to drive even further improvement to our underlying free cash flow profile.Turning briefly to our integrated gas business in EG after receiving a substantial catch-up cast distribution. During second quarter we expect the relationship between earnings and cash distributions to normalize over the second half of the year. Third quarter distributions should be somewhat evenly split between dividends and return of capital. Looking a bit further ahead to 2024, we continue to expect to realize significant financial uplift in EG on the back of an increase in our global LNG price exposure. We're right on track with all the necessary contractual milestones. And beginning January 1, 2024, all the sourced LNG will no longer be sold at Henry Hub linkage. It will be sold in the global LNG market. This arbitrage between Henry Hub and global LNG pricing trickled with the highly competitive market for LNG cargoes from reliable suppliers is expected to drive significant financial uplift for our company at current forward card pricing.To take further advantage of these new commercial terms, we are actively assessing up to a 2-well infill drilling program at Alba, targeting high confidence, low execution risk, shorter cycle opportunities that should mitigate base decline and maximize equity molecules through the LNG plan under the more attractive global LNG linked pricing. These opportunities are expected to compete with the risk-based returns generated from our U.S. resource plays, although any Alba infill capital spending is unlikely to make a significant impact on our overall 2024 capital program. Yet, it's not just about capturing near-term commercial uplift in EG. As we've stated before and consistent with the recently executed HOA with the EG government and our partner Chevron, we're equally focused on the longer-term outlook via the gas mega hub concept.By truly leveraging our unique world-class infrastructure in one of the most gas prone areas of West Africa, we expect to extend the life of EG LNG well into the next decade and further enhance our multiyear free cash flow capacity. The next phases of development in the same gas [indiscernible] as well as potential cross-border opportunities. With that, I will turn it over to Lee, who will wrap up our prepared remarks.Lee Tillman: Thank you, Mike. For years now, I have reiterated that for our company and for our sector to attract increased investor sponsorship, we must deliver financial performance competitive with other investment alternatives in the market. As measured by corporate returns, free cash flow generation and return of capital, more S&amp;P, less E&amp;P. We've delivered exactly that type of performance over the last 2 years and not just competitive, but at the very top. Our one-line investment thesis is this: top-tier sustainable free cash flow generation with an advantaged return of capital profile and sector-leading per share growth, all underpinned by an investment-grade balance sheet. For 2023, we're well positioned to again lead both our peer group and the S&amp;P 500 on the metrics that matter most.If this pure-leading financial and operational delivery is not a 1-year phenomenon. It's a continuation of a multiyear trend and sustainable. And looking ahead to 2024, I don't expect anything to change. My confidence is underpinned by our high-quality and oil-weighted U.S. unconventional portfolio that's complemented by our unique fully integrated global LNG business in EG. To close, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the way we position our company. We are results driven, but it is also about how we deliver those results. staying true to our core values and responsibly delivering the oil and gas the world needs. And the world needs more energy, not less. The energy transition is really an energy expansion and oil and gas is uniquely positioned to drive global economic of living we have all content to enjoy.With that, we can open the line up for Q&amp;A.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Greg Brown: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with revenue and earnings per share both exceeding our guidance. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13% and operating earnings were up 15%, driven by strong growth across all three technologies. And in Products and Systems Integration, continued robust demand and improved supply chain availability led to a 12% growth in revenue and a 52% growth in operating earnings in the segment. Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up approximately $850 million versus last year, and also up approximately $200 million sequentially. Second, our exceptional performance during the quarter was broad-based, with double-digit revenue growth in both segments both regions and in all three technologies, including 20% growth in Command Center and 17% growth in Video Security. We also saw record Q2 orders in both segments during the quarter, driven by customers prioritizing technology investments to strengthen public safety and enterprise security. And finally, based on our Q2 results and the continued strong demand we’re seeing across the business, we’re again raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. I’ll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 12% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $23 million, while acquisitions added $20 million. GAAP operating earnings were $518 million or 21.6% of sales, up from 16.7% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $641 million, up 29% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 350 basis points. The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, inclusive of our higher prices, pricing, lower direct material costs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $2.15 compared to $1.33 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, up 28% from $2.07 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q2 was $555 million, up $53 million versus last year, primarily due to increased expenses from acquisitions, investments in video and higher employee-related incentives in the current year. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $93 million, up $83 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $40 million, up $89 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. The linearity of our cash flow is expected to be consistent with last year with higher earnings and improved working capital driving increased cash flow in the second half. Also, as we previously highlighted, this year’s cash flow includes approximately $300 million of additional cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $70 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization that we did in 2022. Capital allocation in Q2 included $224 million in share repurchases, $148 million in cash dividends and $53 million of CapEx. Moving to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 12% versus last year, driven by improved supply availability in the current year and the benefit from pricing actions continuing to flow through. Currency headwinds were $10 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $2 million. Operating earnings were $285 million or 19.8% of sales, up from 14.6% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend for semiconductors and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include $145 million P25 system upgrade for Kern County, California. A $41 million P25 system and device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $31 million P25 system expansion for Ventura County, California, a $19 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer and a $6 million fixed video order for a large U.S. healthcare customer. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13%, including 20% growth in Command Center and 19% growth in Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $18 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $13 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $356 million, up 15% versus last year and operating margins were 36.9%, up from 36.1% last year. On higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher costs from acquisitions. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $34 million video order for the Virginia State Police, which included our largest in-car video order ever, a $15 million LMR services agreement with City of Baltimore, Maryland, a $13 million managed services agreement for LMR and a renewal in Latin America; a $12 million Command Center order for a U.S. federal customer and an $8 million LMR service agreement with another U.S. federal customer. Looking at regional results for the company, North America Q2 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 11% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q2 revenue was $762 million, up 16% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $856 million versus last year, driven by strong demand in all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was up $211 million, driven by record Q2 orders in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $496 million or 11% and year-over-year and up $100 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR demand. In Software and Services, backlog was up $360 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and the adjustment related to the ESN contract exit. Sequentially, backlog was up $111 million, driven by record Q2 orders in the segment. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.99 and $3.04 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.875 billion to $9.9 billion, up from our prior range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.40 and $11.48 per share up from our prior guidance of $11.21 to $11.29 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. Before turning it back to Greg, I wanted to provide some color on a few financial topics. First, an update on the CMA and Airwave. As we’ve stated previously, we strongly disagree with the CMA’s final decision. Earlier this week, the CMA issued its remedies order regarding implementation of their final decision effective on August 1. This procedural next step does not change our position regarding the ongoing appeal process and our strong belief in our case. However, from an accounting perspective, beginning August 1, we will now defer revenue for the amount above the remedies order price control until the appeals process has been completed. This deferral and resulting lower revenue from Airwave for the remainder of the year is fully incorporated into our increased revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Second, earlier this week, Moody’s upgraded our credit from two Baa2 from Baa3. This higher credit rating underscores the strength of our balance sheet, including the strong liquidity position, our balanced debt maturity profile, significantly improved pension status, along with a track record of consistently growing earnings and cash flow. And finally, our increased guidance for the year highlights the strength of our business as we enter the second half. Our backlog is exceptionally strong, driven by robust customer demand. And based on our current pipeline and supply chain environment, we expect backlog to remain strong going forward. Additionally, the expected lower semiconductors we articulated in February, the cost related to these semiconductors coupled with the pricing adjustments in our own portfolio that were implemented in the second half of last year are driving the significant full year margin expansion of approximately 175 basis points. That is implied in our increased guidance. I’m now turning the call back to Greg. Greg Brown: Jason, thank you very much. First, our exceptional Q2 results highlight the continued strong momentum we’re seeing across the business. We grew revenue double-digits in both segments, both regions, and in all three technologies. We expanded operating margins by 350 basis points, and we achieved record Q2 orders, which has led to our highest ending backlog ever for a second quarter, and is driving our increased guidance for the full year. Second, we continue to leverage our global installed base to sell more value-add Software and Services to our customers. During the quarter, Software and Services revenue was up 13% with strong growth in all three technologies. We also achieved record Q2 orders in this segment, highlighted by our largest in-car video order ever from the Virginia State Police that included automated license plate recognition and digital evidence management. And with our recent Rave acquisition, we’ve made significant advances in integration across our ecosystem, which is driving strong pipeline demand for Rave together with our command center products. And finally, I just wanted to spend a little time and provide some color on artificial intelligence. We recognized AI and the potential impact it could have on our customers back a few years ago when we acquired Avigilon and its AI capabilities. And we’ve seen and continue to see this technology driving opportunity for both our business and our customers. AI along with generative AI plays an important role in our solutions to help keep communities safe from actively analyzing live video and alerting humans when something important happens to assisting a 911 call with our live translation solution to automatically redacting evidence, these advancements improve response times, which can help save lives while also enhancing privacy for those involved. AI will continue to enhance how our solutions help protect people, property, and places. With our ongoing investments and deep expertise, we’re very well-positioned in this space, and we expect to see increased adoption of these technologies from public safety, enterprises, and private organizations alike for a more proactive approach to safety and security. I’ll now turn the call back to Tim and we’ll open it up for your questions. Tim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I’d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? See also 20 Countries With Highest Cost Of Electricity and 20 Most Educated Cities in the US.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Tim Long: Thank you. I’ll start with the clarification, Jason, one for you, Greg. Jason, yes, pretty impressive, you’re raising numbers despite the change in accounting for Airwave. Just wanted to clarify there we got the new revenue level that was mandated and that you guys are accounting to. Can you just talk a little bit about expenses? I think you guys have run that network pretty efficiently. So should we assume a comparable expense level to how things have been running? Or is does something change on that side on the EPS impact? And then for Greg, if you could just talk a little bit about macro, it sounds like everything’s going pretty well, but if you could just hit on kind of what you’re seeing from the government customers and to what extent you’re starting to see federal and ARPA type of dollars flowing into the business. That’d be great. Thank you. Jason Winkler: Thanks, Tim. So our expectations for Airwave revenues this year with the now deferred revenue effective August 1 are for about $480 million of revenue from Airwave. That’ll be down from about $560 million last year. To answer your question on cost, we run that network and provide a service level. I wouldn’t anticipate significant cost changes. Our cost to run that network and deliver the services are what they are. So we are deferring about $80 million in revenue this year and still raising our guidance from the last time we were together by about $140 million. Greg Brown: And to Jason’s point, the $80 million reduction due to accounting and the required treatment of that from $560 million to $480 million is obviously all in the back half of the year starting August 1, running through the remainder of the year. As in terms of expenses and investment, we continue to invest in Airwave by the way, Tim just a few months ago the end users gave us feedback and network performance and reliability, which was as high as we’ve ever achieved on Airwave. So we’re proud of that and we continue to maintain and invest on behalf of our end users. In terms of macro, high level the business is as good as I’ve ever seen it. The demand drivers are strong. Jack has talked about, and we’ll talk a little bit about today if you want about device refresh. And interestingly, Tim, Molloy mentioned last year, we try to track demand against the orders achieved last year, and we believe as best we could tell less than 5% of our orders last year were tagged due to ARPA. Through the first half of this year, we also believe it’s less than 5% as well. So the nice thing about this is, we’re seeing demand drivers around public safety, video security, access control, command center, software and services that’s really underpinning environmental and overall demand sure ARPA helps, but as best we could tell, it’s fairly minimal. Jack Molloy: I’d agree with that, Greg. The only thing I’d add to that, and I think you highlighted the benefits from a product standpoint, but from S&amp;S standpoint, a year-over-year, we had a $360 million increase in backlog. In addition to that, we’re in receipt of a contract from the State of Illinois for a $300 million frame agreement for a 10-year period for services. That’s incremental and that’s not reflected in our backlog, Tim. So I think that’s just another proof point to the conversations we’re having with customers really resonate for their needs right now. Tim Long: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Greg Brown: Thanks, Tim. Operator: And our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is open. George Notter: Hi guys, thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about margins and profitability. I think at one point you guys were looking for about a $50 million benefit this year on lower brokers fees and expedite fees. I guess I’m wondering if that’s still the expectation for this year. And then also I’m curious about what the overall level of broker fees and expedite fees you’re carrying for this year would look like. And when do those step back down? Would that be a 2024 event or when do you see relief there? Thanks.Jason Winkler: Hi George, thanks for the question. So we began the year with an expectation for $50 million of lower costs related to premiums through brokers. We’re trending a bit better than that. We’re on path to about a $60 million year-over-year benefit largely in the first half. We’re still spending some investments on brokers. As we look into next year, we would expect to comparable benefit level of about $60 million into 2024 for brokers. Again, the supply chain environment remains fluid. It’s incrementally better, but we’re still using the same tools we’ve been using for over a year to make sure that we get the supplies that we need. The level of commitment from our suppliers is strong but their lead times remain elevated still. And so from time to time we will use PPV [ph] to secure the parts to match the record demand that we’re seeing. Greg Brown: And I do have to say thanks to for all the engineers in Motorola, because as we manage PPV and to Jason’s point, we’ll achieve now $60 million, a little higher than $50 million’s target. And we – that would be our goal for next year as well another $60 million. A lot of the engineers in Motorola have done real time under Molloy’s leadership and Scott Mottonen and others. They’ve done product redesign in a way that’s allowed us to substitute parts in a matter of months that also have allowed the company to be adept and firm and responsive to our customers. And I just want everybody to know on the engineering community how grateful we are for that because they were – they’ve been superstars. George Notter: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, if I do the math, I think you’re still caring about $150 million in annualized expedite fees or brokers fees. Is that right for this year? Jason Winkler: Yes. This year’s envelope is going to be a little less than that. It’s more important that we – as we look at next year’s envelope reducing by $60 million, that’s our current thinking. As we go through supply planning, there’s other offsets that are always in the mix around direct materials costs, some positive, some unfavorable. So as we look to next year, we see a $60 million benefit, particularly related to this opportunity from broker fees. George Notter: Great. Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Greg Brown: Thanks, George. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start on Airwave. Just a clarification, admittedly, I think we’re all outside our core competency and trying to read through these legal documents here, but $200 million in U.S. dollars. So I guess the first question would be just to understand how you came up with that $80 million headwind? And then secondly, what absent the appeal? What that number would go to in 2024 as we try to think about shaping our models for the worst case scenario? Jason Winkler: Yes. So first of all, the beginning date of the deferral for revenue is consistent with the remedies order, which is August 1 to the end of the year. That’s the approximately $80 million. If you do the math on that for next year it would – it’d be approximately another $100 million step down. There are a variety of inputs that go into us servicing Airwave, the usage of the network, the one-time events that go with the network, the number of user communities that subscribe as well as inflation and other variables that go into how much revenue we recognize from the contract. All those things together last year $560 million, this year on path to $480 million and then you can do the math on the price control into next year for approximately another $100 million decline. Adam Tindle: For the full year, yes. Jason Winkler: For the full year, correct. Greg Brown: And Adam, what I’d say is like I think this process is proceeding as expected. So we knew that the CMA issued a final decision. In Q2, we knew it would be followed by a remedies order statutorily, they could have gone till October to do that as late as October. They did it now in light of the remedies implementation order, that requires the accounting treatment Jason just described. It doesn’t change at all our belief and our confidence in this case, by the way. The hearing, the appeal to the competition appeals tribunal was yesterday and today. So that part is done as well. Now we will wait to see what they rule on the appeal. We have said and I’ve said we’ve been very consistent. We think this action is unprecedented overreaching. It effectively is opening up an already agreed on binding legal contract. But we’ll see how it plays out, in the meantime, we’ve deferred the revenue through the end of this year as required and to articulate and quantify what it could be. If nothing else changed, it would be another approximately $100 million deferral or reduction of Airwave on a full year basis next year. Adam Tindle: Okay. And that $100 million on revenue, would that also be about approximately that on the EBIT line or any way to think for us to think about EBIT on that a $100 million? Jason Winkler: Yes, so as I mentioned to Tim, the cost structure and our needs to run this network haven’t changed. So the lower revenue largely tracks to a lower a margin amount as well.Adam Tindle: Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then absent that, obviously Greg, as you mentioned, the rest of the business is running in incredibly well. Notably, the PSI segment over 50% operating income growth on 12% revenue growth and I’m looking at a first half margin near 20%, which is I think maybe even unprecedented for that segment in total for the first half. So I guess a question on that would be how do you see the margin trajectory of that piece of the business? I know it’s been through a lot whether it was COVID and pandemic and all that. I wonder if you’re coming out the other side with maybe a structurally improved margin profile and how you’re thinking about the trajectory of that piece of business. Thanks. Greg Brown: First of all, I’d say that, and again, I compliment the team, Jason, Jack, on the improved gross margins, both on cost of goods as well as – as you know, we’ve taken a series of pricing actions starting last year and coming into this year. We view those pricing actions as sticky, not transient. So the margin profiles better. In terms of growth of LMR and the technology, we’ve guided for the full year mid-single-digits, we still expect that to be appropriate full year guidance. We’re coming off some monster comps in the first half of this year. And by the way, the Airwave accounting treatment of the $80 million reduction or deferral in revenue is in the back half of this year, that would be reflected in the LMR technology. Having said that, I’m super proud of the gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion and while obviously we’re sitting in August, so it’s too early to talk about 2024, but it would be my and our expectations to grow operating margins in 2024 as well. Jason Winkler: So it’s important to note also in terms of the first half performance, and you’re right, we had significant margin expansion in products. That’s off of last year’s first half, which included our highest broker costs as well as last year’s first half didn’t include our own pricing increases. So effective July 1 of last year in our second half, you saw significant on good growth, significant margin step up in the second half. That’s continued through the first half of this year. And as we look to growth in our second half this year, we’ll still have margin increases over those records from last year. And really that’s a function of when we implemented the price increases and when the PPV or higher broker costs have come out of our product set. Adam Tindle: Got it. Thank you. Greg Brown: Thanks, Adam. Operator: And we’ll move next to Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Ben Bollin: Thanks. I appreciate you guys taking the question. Greg, I was hoping you could – you made the comment about the overall funding environment being so healthy. And I’m not trying to get you to guide into 2024, but I’m interested how you think about just public sector funding overall, the sources of income to public sector and how you think that’s evolving as you look out over into 2024 and beyond. Greg Brown: Well, I like number one to your point, Ben, thanks for the question. The underlying demand drivers of the business are strong absent funding. Then you get the funding and I talked about the, as best we can tell, the percentage orders in terms of order volume attributed to ARPA is 5% or less. The other thing I like is the multi-year nature of state and local funding, which is $350 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act and $170 billion of education, which is an absolutely prioritized vertical for us and what Jack Molloy and his team are doing. So we’re not going to guide on 2024, but the fact that we had the print we had and record Q2 orders and record Q2 ending backlog and improved 12-month duration of backlog. And the other thing Molloy and I track is pipeline, right? So what’s the pipeline and funnel? What’s the stuff coming in at the top? How are we doing on order conversion and velocity? And when Jack and I look at that, that’s favorable as well. And in terms of the health of the overall state and local budgets, they remain strong too. Jack Molloy: Thank you, Greg. And I think what I would say there is when we think about top of the pipeline being quoting, bottom of the pipeline being orders, and then the most important metric is the velocity between those two. The our velocity remains consistent. In fact, it’s improved and we’ve seen a growing number of quoting. So I think that portends well to 2024. The other thing that I think is lost in a lot of people when we think about government funding, we’ve talked about ARPA. But when you think about personal income tax, corporate income tax and sales tax, those three funding streams have all been the beneficiary for government from inflation. So inflation for them means they get more tax receipts in. And their costs haven’t necessarily gone in parallel. And I think a lot of people don’t necessarily understand that, but I just wanted to mention that. So all things in, I think the funding environment and government remains very strong.Ben Bollin: That’s helpful. I appreciate that. And then Jack, I was hoping you could take us through how you see K-12 developing. If you could speak to the significance of the deal sizes themselves, the nature of the project that you’re seeing, just any thoughts there would be helpful. And that’s it for me. Thank you. Jack Molloy: So, well, K-12 is – there’s really two technologies. It’s video security and access control. And depending on the type of school district, we’ve seen an acceleration into our Alta, Avigilon Alta, which is cloud, but we’ve also got larger school districts that continue to buy Unity. But the K-12 education in general, we put the marker in that our video business is growing 15% K-12 and the EDU market is, is surpassing that growth level. It did last year, and it continues to grow through the first half of this year very robustly. And I think some of that’s the beneficiary of ARPA funding, but I think a lot of it is really much more – it’s much more secular around school security and that it’s getting prioritized over everything else. Mahesh Saptharishi: One more thing maybe to add to that is just from a safety reimagine standpoint, we’re also integrating Rave along with Orchestrate and Rave. We now have integrations going into aware with a panic button. We also have the capacity to integrate weapons detection. We also launched weapons detection for the school’s market. So all in all, we have other headwinds come – tailwinds coming with us there to push the whole story from a school security standpoint. Greg Brown: Good point, Mahesh. Mahesh Saptharishi: Thanks, Ben. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Joseph Cardoso with J.P. Morgan. Your light is open. Joseph Cardoso: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just one for me. And maybe this is just kind of a broader picture question. The God embeds sort of a normal seasonality in the back half, at least relative to pre-COVID era. However, at the same time you guys are staring at a much larger backlog now, can you just walk us through the puts and takes around that why you’re not seeing better seasonal trends as we kind of go through the back half and I guess particularly just given that you’re seeing better supply headwinds – or sorry, seeing supply handlings ease more broadly, just curious whatever thoughts you have on that. Thank you. Greg Brown: Yes. Joseph, just – I’m sure Jason will jump in as well, but I remind you that, you’re right. Normally, this business is typically Q3 and Q4 weighted and seasonally dense. I think that’s unchanged. But remember, we’re guiding an increase in top and bottom, even with the $80 million of Airwave deferral in the back half and another $50 million of PCR light business model change. Jason can elaborate on that. So that’s $130 million of revenue growth that needs to be incorporated into the second half guide, but still informs and allows us to raise. And on the bottom EPS line we have an incremental $0.30 tax headwind, $0.50 for the year. We had $0.20 headwind, first half $0.30 of EPS structural tax headwind back half. So as you incorporate those ingredients into the blender, it shouldn’t take away or distract at all that the demand is strong, the raise is strong and the momentum is strong. Jason Winkler: So business model change in low end PCR we mentioned in February, we’ve gone to a model where we only recognized the margin and the revenue in the product, no longer the COGS. So it’s OE neutral, but did change the revenue line. That was a way to focus our business on higher value efforts. So that’s something… Greg Brown: And the choice, we… Jason Winkler: Choice we did in February and it’s working out quite well. The other thing I’d point you to is the lead times from our key semiconductor manufacturers and the commitments they give us for getting us the products and the semiconductors we need, support the increased guide and continue to represent opportunity for us as we go forward. But we get commitments from them and we plan the business and how much revenue we can unlock out of backlog based on that. Joseph Cardoso: Yes. Got it. Thanks. Appreciate all the color there. Greg Brown: Thank you Joseph. Operator: Next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum: Good afternoon guys and great results and impressive guide. Greg, as we look at your software and services margin sitting almost 37% this quarter. I guess the question is, is like, where can those margins go to and maybe some color on the incremental margins for every buck of business brought in? Can help us kind of clear the picture?Greg Brown: Well, we had previously said, Keith, thanks for the question that on the full year, we thought we could achieve comparable margins. We had great S&amp;S performance in Q2 and we thought we could have for the full year, as we told you a quarter ago, comparable maybe slightly down, but I thought we were shooting for comparable operating margins in light of the required accounting treatment on Airwave and the decrement of $80 million starting August 1. That falls obviously to SNS and the requisite profitability that Jason articulated. So I’ve now and we now expect S&amp;S operating margins accounting for that deferral to be down on an operating margin year-over-year basis. In terms of next year, it’s too early to, to guide for that. And we have to see ultimately what’s decided with the Competition Appeal Tribunal appeal and what the disposition of Airwave is from a financial perspective. That said, we continue to make improvements on synergies and platforming S&amp;S, maybe Mahesh could talk a little bit about that. We’re doing some successful orchestration and integration to get the software sleeves more integrated and working a little bit more seamlessly and a little bit more efficiently. So there’s opportunity, Keith, but it would be premature to quantify at this time. Keith Housum: All right, I appreciate that. Mahesh Saptharishi: Across our platform… Keith Housum: I’m sorry, go ahead Mahesh. Mahesh Saptharishi: So across our platforms whether that’s cloud or on-prem we are exercising greater synergies in terms of core technology stack. We are optimizing some of our cloud delivery capabilities and really focusing a lot on ease of install as well, so all of that translates to hopefully a good game for us. Keith Housum: Got you. Thank you. And then coming back to the CMA ruling and the appeals process, I guess, Greg, what’s the next steps, assuming that you guys lose on appeal? Can you provide perhaps a rough timeline about how this plays out here over the next year or two? Greg Brown: Well, in terms of the appeal, it would be our expectation that the CAT rules on the appeal by the end of Q3. I don’t really want to get into hypotheticals on if this, then, that, but we have been consistent, Keith, that said, we will exercise all legal avenues available to us. So the next step after the CAT, if the CAT rules against us would be us taking to this to the UK Court of Appeals. And that would be after the CAT ruling. I don’t know the timeline of what they would do. What happens there is they have to decide up or down whether they would actually hear the case. I don’t know the timeline that they have available to them in terms of the window to decide. So this will go on a few more months and hopefully we can give you more clarity on the next earnings call. Keith Housum: Great. Thank you. Greg Brown: Thanks, Keith. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll move next to Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Just a couple questions for me. First, obviously the backlog continues to grow. I guess, I just want to make sure is there anything that we should be mindful of a peak quarter for product just in terms of as the supply chain clears and less forward orders? Or is this just really a result of kind of strength of multi-year orders, maybe as the first question. And then as a second question, just traction on kind of bringing APX NEXT into the mid-market or just kind of adoption trends that you’re seeing there? Thanks. Greg Brown: Our expectation for backlog and specifically product backlog is for it to remain strong through the duration of the year. That’s a function of our expectations for continued strong inbound orders, as well as the amount of backlog that we can unlock with the available componentry that we need. Jason Winkler: And related to APX NEXT, Meta, we are now – we had a very strong quarter of new orders. In terms of Q2, we received another $80 million now bringing it close to a half of $500 million in APX NEXT. And when I look at the complexion of those orders, it’s not just big cities, but it’s starting to hit into the Tier 2 cities as well. So we’re really pleased with the performance of that product line. Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Jason Winkler: Thanks, Meta. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open. Louie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh, and Tim, good afternoon. Greg Brown: Louie, how are you? Louie DiPalma: Doing excellent. Thank you. As it relates to the LMR device refresh last quarter you discussed how 80% of LMR radio orders were for your older APX radio, despite how APX NEXT has had the strongest demand of any new radio that you have ever introduced and how it was introduced way back in October 19. Why are so many customers still adopting the older APX platform and does this instill confidence that the upgrade cycle for APX NEXT will still potentially be in full effect even a decade from now?Greg Brown: So just a couple points. The first of which is think about the government’s procurement cycle, which is one to say it’s long cycle, it’s long years. We did not announce the mid-tier APX NEXT until Q3, late Q3 of 2022. So Louie, what that’s really a function of a byproduct of when it was announced, what was actually able to be quoted at that point in time. But without question, we’re seeing acceleration to the numbers, $80 million in a quarter on the new orders, the type and the striation of customers that are buying those devices. So the other piece of it, just historically speaking, having worked here long enough to see probably three pretty large scale device refreshes, it typically takes three years – three to five years post-launch to start to alleviate and move those legacy versions down and through the cycle. Louie DiPalma: Great. And it seems that The House committee has approved a $15 billion next-generation 911 funding bill. And on this topic, what is the status of the integration of Rave Wireless with your VESTA solution? And has the adoption of Rave accelerated as a result of the combination with Motorola? Have you juiced up Rave’s ability to generate orders from the education vertical and enterprise vertical? Mahesh Saptharishi: Absolutely. So we – as of last quarter, we are now bundling the Rave 911 suite along with our VESTA, new VESTA sales. So it comes part of that as a whole. In addition to that we have been actively working on just – Rave, remember, is an important bridge for us from enterprise security to public safety. And we’re adding more and more lanes to that bridge with every integration that we do here. The VESTA integration is definitely one of those. I mentioned the panic button integration with aware being another one. We’re integrating Rave into Orchestrate, which now ties that in with the video and access control pieces as well. So together Rave now plugs into public safety more effectively. And then Rave and aware together actually allows us to connect different instances of CAD as well. So dispatchers instances can communicate with each other as well. So as you look at the install base that we have in VESTA, as you look at the install base that we have in schools, K-12 schools with video and access control, we’re leveraging all of that by bringing that together as this bridge between public safety and enterprise security gets wider. Louie DiPalma: Great. Thanks, Mahesh. And lastly for me, do you have any thoughts on the reported TETRA cybersecurity vulnerabilities? Mahesh Saptharishi: Sure. So I think the first thing is Etsy is the primary spokesman in custodian for the TETRA standard in conjunction with the critical communications authority in Europe. What was reported, I think the first thing I’d like to point out is what was reported is there was no weaknesses found in the public safety algorithms. There’s three algorithms. Tier 1, TEA1 is actually for general use. It’s a little bit more open due to export control issues. But there’s been no exploitation of operational networks that we know of. And essentially subsequent to those findings, which we knew about even into late last year there’s been software patches and then upgrades to the algorithms that have been done subsequent to that. So this was actually paid, this was a research tank done out of the Netherlands who actually did the testing. So yes, something we knew about we had a – the primary weakness was in general use, and I think it’s been remediated since then. Louie DiPalma: Great. So it’s been resolved already. Thanks. Mahesh Saptharishi: Yes. In our view, yes. Thanks, Louie. Louie DiPalma: Thanks. Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Greg Brown: Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us, but just in closing, I want to make sure I thank all the employees and the people in Motorola Solutions worldwide and all of our channel partners worldwide. I’m proud of you and we’re proud of you, most especially what you do, how you do it, and the execution. I said in the call, you heard from Jason and Mahesh and Jack, this business is performing as well as I’ve ever seen it. Demand is strong. It’s strong for what we do, public safety, enterprise security. And I like what we’re doing to meet that demand and exceed that demand with the execution of what we do and what we’re doing on the portfolio reinvention and device refresh. We talk a lot about APX NEXT and all the great work done there, but there’s also great work being done on video security and access control that Mahesh is doing around 911 command center.And while we’re doing that and running the business and lowering PPV costs and incrementally improving supply chain and engineering in real time doing product redesign, we’re expanding gross margins, we’re expanding operating margins. We have a record Q2 for orders. We end Q2 with record backlog. We talked about the duration of backlog being stronger. And Jack talked about the pipeline activity and the order velocity and conversion. It’s excellent. And Jason talked about that we expect backlog to be strong for the balance of the remainder of the year. The last two things I’d say is we referenced it a little bit, we just talked about Rave. I’m really proud of the acquisitions we’ve made, the integration work that’s been done organizationally and strategically, but also technically. And those acquisitions are performing at or above what we expected. We have – I love the upgrade. We just got, we have a strong balance sheet. We continue to be disciplined in capital allocation, and I think we have an excellent opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining us, and we’ll talk to you again in a few months. Thank you. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the internet within three hours.

QuoteRevenuesNet sales in the reported quarter were $1,918.4 million, down 16.6% year over year. The decline was primarily due to weak demand trends in Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), Home Networks and Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) segments. The top line missed the consensus estimate by $124 million.Revenues from CCS were down 29.2% to $698.9 million from $986.7 million in the year-ago quarter.

53,36c1265e-0ce5-3454-b011-44b346e0d78b,SBUX,2023-08-05,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-corporation-nasdaq-sbux-goes-120316661.html,1691236996,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Starbucks' shares on or after the 10th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.53 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.12 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Starbucks has a trailing yield of approximately 2.1% on its current stock price of $100.68. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Starbucks paid out more than half (64%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Starbucks generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 80% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Starbucks's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years. It paid out more than three-quarters of its earnings in the last year, even though earnings per share are growing rapidly. We're surprised that management has not elected to reinvest more in the business to accelerate growth further.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Starbucks has delivered 18% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Starbucks for the upcoming dividend? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Starbucks's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 64% and 80% respectively. To summarise, Starbucks looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.While it's tempting to invest in Starbucks for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Starbucks that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

In the latter half of 2022, the company closed on the acquisition of Meggitt. The cash transaction value of £7 billion (approximately $8.5 billion) was modest compared to the firm’s enterprise value of ~$50 billion, however a meaningful indication of management’s prowess. This, in our opinion, is a very well‐timed combination, as Meggitt adds complementary aerospace and defense businesses to an already existing strong portfolio. It should also support Parker Hannifin’s goal of shifting its portfolio toward aftermarket exposure—a catalyst we had identified forthe company—since aftermarketsales are typically highermargin and result in more predictable recurring revenues than original‐equipment sales. Importantly, Parker Hannifin is no stranger to successful acquisitions, having integrated dozens (though mostly smaller than Meggitt) throughout its history.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Archer-Daniels-Midland. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Archer-Daniels-Midland does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Archer-Daniels-Midland's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Archer-Daniels-Midland. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.9% of common stock, and State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm holds about 8.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$280m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Archer-Daniels-Midland. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Archer-Daniels-Midland has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The company achieved record second quarter net sales of $1.85 billion in the 2023 second quarter, 12.1% higher than net sales of $1.66 billion in the 2022 comparable period, and 14.4% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter was 52.5% compared with 47.1% in the comparative 2022 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 second quarter as compared to the 2022 second quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased operating costs and increased aluminum can costs. The increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in the alcohol segment and in which our sales had quite a nice bump as you seen from the release. As expected, promotional allowances for the 2023 second quarter were marginally higher than the comparable 2022 second quarter, as well as 2023 first quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 second quarter were $450.4 million, compared with $406.9 million in the 2022 second quarter, as a percentage of net sales operating expenses for the 2023 second quarter were 24.3% compared to 24.6% in the 2022 second quarter. Distribution expenses for the 2023 second quarter decreased to $82 million, or 4.4% of net sales compared to $87.9 million or 5.3% of net sales in the 2022 second quarter. The $5.8 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight out expenses of $11.8 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of $4.8 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. We are purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have returned to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The costs of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. The company continues to address certain challenges in its supply chain as it navigates the current global supply chain environment. Operating income for the 2023 second quarter increased 14.4% to $523.8 from $373 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 second quarter was 23.2% compared with 25.3% in the 2022 second quarter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense, a decrease in the effective state income tax rate, as well as an increase in net income in certain foreign jurisdictions, which have lower tax rates compared to the United States. Net income increased 51.4% to $413.9 million, as compared to $273.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 second quarter increased 52.8% to $0.39 from $0.26 in the second quarter of 2022. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022, as well as in many other international markets in 2022, and in the first half of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. In the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24 ounce lines effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Monster’s market sharing value increased 0.4 points to 28.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 75.3% and its market sharing increased 1.7 points to 5.6%. The Nielsen's statistics from Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by sales in the OXA convenience chain, which dominates the market sales in the OXA convenience chain in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen for the month of June 2023 compared to June 2022, Monster’s retail market sharing value increased in Argentina from 50.5% to 55.5%, in Chile from 38.1% to 40.8%. And in Brazil from 41.6% to 44.4%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide. Because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen in a 13 week period until June 18, 2023. Monster’s retail market sharing value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 16.2% to 16.6% in Belgium, from 32.7% 33.1% in France, from 29.8% to 31.1%, in Great Britain, from 31.8% to 35.2% in Norway, from 28.1% to 30.3% in the Republic of Ireland, from 39.4% to 41.6% in Spain, and from 15.6% to 15.9% in Sweden.

According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending June 2023, Monster’s market sharing value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year decreased from 59.9% to 57.6%. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four week periods may often be materially influenced positively and or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during these periods. Net sales to customers outside the US was $715.4 million, 38.6% of total net sales in the 2023 second quarter compared to $649 million, or 39.2% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in the US and US dollars by approximately $38.4 million in the 2023 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales, our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the US and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 second quarter, increased 13% in dollars, and increased 16.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter was 34% compared to 26.7% in the same quarter in 2022.

The decrease in sales in Chile were due in part to a normalization of bottler inventory levels. Net sales in Argentina decreased 19.5% in dollars, but increased 54% in local currency in the 2023 second quarter. We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. which will be referred to as VPX, the former maker of Bang Energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorneys fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang Energy. VPX has appealed the judgment. We also previously discussed the false advertising case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, in which the jury returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages. And the District Court granted MEC’s motion for a permanent injunction in joining VPX and former CEO Jack Owoc from falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang any other beverages contained creatine or form of creatine, VPX and Jack Owoc appealed the injunction. The bodies have completed briefing on remaining post round issues On October 10, 2022 VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries, and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On June 28, 2023, VPX and certain affiliates entered into an asset purchase agreement with the company, which among other things provided for the company's acquisition of substantially all of the VPX's assets. The transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement closed on July 31, 2023, at which time the company was deemed to have allowed general unsecured claims in VPX's bankruptcy case relating to the arbitration award, and the jury's award, subject to the potential modification of the Jury Award in the light of pending post-verdict motions filed by MEC and VPX. The asset purchase agreement also includes a mutual release between VPX and MEC which among other things, requires VPX to dismiss its appeals of the trademark infringement arbitration and the false advertising case, as well as cases that VPX filed against MEC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This mutual release does not include any claims the company might have against Mr. Owoc in relation to their jury award. The company will not recognize the allowed general unsecured claims or the jury award as it relates to Mr. Owoc [inaudible] realized or realizable. We will not be answering questions on these legal proceedings on today's call. In June 2023, the company also entered into an agreement with Orange Bank Inc. regarding the company's use and registration of certain bank trademarks and trade names subject to the successful closure of the asset purchase agreement. Under this agreement, the company will pay Orange Bank Inc. a onetime payment of approximately $12.5 million and a 2.5% royalty on all future sales of products bearing the trade name Bang. On June 31, 2023, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc. Sorry, apologize on July 31 2023, we completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, collectively Bang Energy for a purchase price of approximately $362 million, subject to adjustments. The acquired assets include Bang Energy beverages, and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. We successfully recruited a limited number of former VPX employees to fill certain open positions within Monster, as well as the majority of the team at the manufacturing site in Phoenix. Pursuant to Monster's obligations with the Coca Cola Company, Bang Energy will be distributed through the Coca Cola bottlers network, starting with the United States in the 2023 third quarter. As a result, there will be a temporary disruption of the product supply of Bang Energy brand energy drinks. Additionally, our intention is to rationalize Bang’s product offerings and product lines and to fully integrate Bang into the Monster infrastructure. We do not intend to manufacture or sell Bang’s other product lines such as Red Line or Shots beyond liquidating existing inventories at this time, we may consider reintroducing certain of those product lines sometime in the future. We are excited about our acquisition of the state of the art Bang Energy production facility in Phoenix, Arizona, which we intend to utilize for Bang as well as other products in the Monster portfolio. As we only completed the acquisition this week, it is still early days and we will provide you with further updates on Bang Energy on our next Investor Call in November. In the first half of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed which is now available in 28 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. According to Nielsen scan data, The Beast Unleashed is currently one of the top new brands in the beer category in 2023. We plan to launch a hot iced tea extension of The Beast Unleashed named Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024. The brand will have full flavors Original, Half &amp; Half, Razzleberry and Green. Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea will be available in 24 oz. single-serve cans as well as in a variety 12-pack in 12 ounce sleek cans. We refreshed the dials and doubled dials beer brands in the first half of 2023 and introduced Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. The brand family has performed well since the refresh. The high Lybrand family the largest in our beer portfolio, from scarcity is also performing well despite overall headwinds in the craft segment and is showing growth in retail scans. Our Alcohol Beverage innovation pipeline is robust, and we look forward to sharing use of additional new products in the future. In the 2023 second quarter in the United States, we focused on gaining distribution on our first quarter product innovation. Following the success of our recent Monster Energy Zero- Sugar launch, we are planning to launch NOS Zero-Sugar in 16 ounce cans in the 2023 fourth quarter. In the 2023 second quarter, we expanded our Java Monster portfolio in Canada with the launch of Java Monster 300 Triple Shot, Mocha and Vanilla. We launched several new products in Latin America in the 2023 second quarter. In Argentina, we introduced our Monster Reserve brand, with the launch of Reserve White Pineapple in June. In the Caribbean, we continue to expand our portfolio and introduced a number of new products in different countries. After we successfully launched Java Monster Super Coffee, Mean Bean and Loca Mocha in Australia earlier this year, we expanded the launch of such products to the New Zealand market in the 2023 second quarter. We are pleased with early results in both markets. In EMEA, in the second quarter of 202,3 we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple, Ultra Gold, Ultra Fiesta Mango, Ultra Paradise, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Used Ozzy Lemonade and Used Chaotic in a number of countries. During the 2023 second quarter, we also launched additional SK use or BPM, Burn, Nalu, Predator and Reign in certain countries. We launched the Monster Energy brand in Egypt in June 2023. To add to Predator which we launched earlier this year in Egypt. In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar Energy drink to an additional eight EMEA markets in the second quarter of 2023 for a total of 35 markets to date. During the second quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan and Monster Ultra Sunrise in Korea and Monster Reserve Pineapple in Turkey. We launched Predator in additional regions in India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023. In July 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Japan and Predator in Iraq. Monster Energy will be launched in the Philippines later this year. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, July 2023 sales were approximately 13.7% higher than the comparable July 2022 sales and 12% higher than July ‘22 excluding the alcohol brand segment. We estimate July 2023 sales, including the alcohol brand segment to be approximately 12.1% higher than in July 2022 and 11.2% higher than in July 2022, excluding the alcohol brand segment. July 2023 had the same number of selling days as July 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, and the timing of price increases, and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. First, the energy category continues to grow globally. Second, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Third, our IFF labor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land of costs to our EMEA region. Fourth, we are enthusiastic for 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Rainstorm and Tour Water in United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA. Fifth, we are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, we are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Sixth, we are excited about the launch of Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with the goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024 as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are pleased with the initial results of our launch Rainstorm, our new line of Total Wellness Energy drinks. Eight, we are pleased with the rollout of Prince and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally, we are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number -- additional number of international markets. Nine, we are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. I would like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you. See also 15 Most Peaceful Countries in the World and 15 European Countries with Best Healthcare for Expats.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Grom at UBS. Peter Grom: Thanks, operator and good afternoon, guys. Hope you're doing well. So I wanted to pick up on the gross margin commentary and just get a sense for how the quarter kind of came in versus your expectations. This is the first time we haven't really seen the sequential improvement on gross margin in about a year. And I know you mentioned promotion, I think you've talked about other costs, back at the shareholder meeting. But can you maybe just talk about how you see the drivers of gross margin evolving through the balance of the year, should we still expect to see sequential progression from here? And then maybe bigger picture, can you help frame where we are on the long term margin recovery journey. Thanks. Hilton Schlosberg: Peter, the difficult answers your question is that we really don't give guidance. So if we look at this quarter that we just reporting, we spoke about some of the drivers behind the improvement in gross margin. But against that, we did have continued increases, and I've said this in previous quarters in certain ingredients and other input costs, as well as co-packing. So that's the fact that will stay with us. And then we have another obviously, issue that we spoke about, and that is geographical sales mix. So as we sell more product overseas, so the margin reduces overall, the percentage gross margin reduces overall. And then, as you look at the alcohol business building, the gross margins from that side of the business are less than the gross margins that we enjoy in the energy drink sector. So you've got pluses and minuses, the alcohol brands, you'll see in the Q that will be released in a day or so that the alcohol brands were $60 million of sales, and that margin is lower, and we've reported it as being lower than in the rest of the business. So, overall, there's really is a mix, and then with a Bang product coming in, we expect that the Bang product will have the same margins as the kind of Ultra products in our own portfolio, the Reign products and Ultra products, and that will improve margins. So overall, there's a -- we've got a mix of positive items that are benefiting gross margins and those items that are detracting from gross margins. Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, and good afternoon. Can you comment on where you're seeing the energy category demand perspective, from a consumer standpoint? And then related to that, obviously, congrats on the acquisition of Bang. How are you planning to lean even more into this wellness energy category, with the organic growth through the House Renovation, Rainstorm, in particular continues to grow fast, but now Bang adds more presence into that sub segment. So what are you – what you can share at this point, I know you're going to share more in the next earnings call. But can you talk about how you can participate even more in that category? And if I can squeeze just a clarification about Brazil and Latin America, I think x, Mexico continues to do well. But I was surprised to see a deceleration. I know, it's tough comparison, when you gain a lot of shares in Brazil, but just to make sure that we get those points in. Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg: So if I talk about the energy category as such, and we started looking at the one week data because the community looks at the one week data, and the energy category is still growing in good double digits 13% in the last week, so we're seeing a good increase in the energy category. And as we look at, traditional energy and wellness energy and performance energy, obviously, you've seen kind of differences within those segments. Interesting, the Bang started off life as a very much performance energy. And today, if you look at the brand, and you analyze what it stands for, really stands for a different segment, which is really lost on energy. So you've got all these different brands that are filling different needs within the energy space. But traditionally, energy is still growing, I did a quick analysis and the traditional energy is still growing and the number I'm looking at is around 10%. You've got this other wellness energy and obviously we are participating in that segment with Rainstorm, yes, which we are really excited about. And then performance energy where we have Reign which is doing very well. The difficulty in, really going deep in -- deep dive into performance energy is that the Bang brand has suffered, because it's lost so much distribution. And that's a factor that obviously is driving that segment of the market. And then quickly, just turning to Brazil, and Chile, the energy category in those countries really grew very rapidly. And we grew extensively within those two countries, but there has been, we've seen a little bit of a slowdown in growth in both Brazil and in Chile.And as you can see, from the numbers that we reported, we are still market leaders. So it's something that is part of doing business within Brazil and in Chile, and we maintaining a market share. And we had a product issue in Chile, which have now been sorted, we bring in product from Mexico, we now are able to produce locally in Chile. But the market has taken somewhat of slowing growth. And, we've been as a market leader, we've been part of that as well. Operator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Two clarifications on the Bang acquisition. So first, can you provide us with like, the last 12 months sales for the brand? And then bigger picture like how are you guys planning to position the brand in the US? What consumers are you going after? And then internationally, you mentioned the transition to the coke system in the US, you plan that also to transition international? And if you can give us any timeline on that. Thank you. Hilton Schlosberg: Maybe I just comment a little bit just, pretty much Hilton, I think covered most of in his last answer. But we are able to look at the brands if you've seen what how the Bank brand has, in fact developed. It was originally in the black can focused, sort of focus on competing with Monster and it then went to a color can and then more recently it went to a white can. And then that white cat has gone through a transition as well. So you then got Reign which is in a black can, and you've got Rainstorm, which is in a 12 ounce white can. And so we see a different way of separating the brands, marketing them differently, and positioning and we think they can all basically fit within our broader portfolio completely separate to NOS which is very much a Motors sort of brand Full Throttle and Monster. So if you look at that packaging, that's how we do it, we're going to probably change the packaging slightly of the Bang brand, but it will remain principally a white can and in a 16 ounce. And so we feel that there is a way which we do -- all these brands can play quite with each other within our portfolio. Operator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if I can just to follow back up on Peter Grom’s question and understanding you don’t give guidance around gross margin. I guess as we looked at it on a gross profit per case basis. You were actually kind of flattish sequentially. So ignoring the percentage but looking at the dollars, is that at all a better way to think about the go forward as just as you're managing gross profit per case on dollar basis relative to the margin. Thanks very much. Hilton Schlosberg: So we always look at gross profit per case. When we launch a product that's very much part of the way that this company has always examined new product introductions. So know your costs that phrase has been something that we preached for any number of years. So as we go forward with new products with new innovation, even for example, with a Bang acquisition, knowing the cost is vital to really being able to position a product within our portfolio. Now, obviously, some products have lower gross profits per case, like, for example, the coffee products, but they are an important part of our portfolio. So as we examine products, and we examine where we are, we always have to look at what we are delivering to consumers to meet to their needs, within the overall ambit of a product portfolio. Now, when we went into energy, into alcohol, I'm sorry, we went into alcohol with our eyes wide open, we knew the margins that were in alcohol would be lower than the margins in the energy drink category. So we look at margin, I've always said this on calls, I say we bank dollars, we don't bank percentages. And I've always encouraged analysts to just think, likewise, that we don't bank percentages, we bank dollars. Operator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey: Hey, good afternoon. How you doing? So just one quick follow up there. And then just kind of like a capital allocation question. But would you mind providing the Latin America gross margin on the quarter? I probably missed it or I'm not sure you gave it. But that would be helpful, and just a Latin America in general. So is there a temporary disruption that we're working through? Or is what we're seeing underlying demand? So just those two follow ups? And then I realized this is a multi-part question, I'm probably going to get in trouble. But just from a capital allocation standpoint, when can you start buying back stock again, so thanks so much. Hilton Schlosberg: So let's talk a little bit about Latin America, remember, we sell to the distributors, and the distributors sell to the retailers. And as the demand is somewhat reduced at retail, the distributors cut back their inventory. So they over inventorize, they cut back. And, unfortunately, we are the recipient of what happens in the distribution channel. So as I said, all of these issues will resolve themselves, because you have these cutbacks, but then we go to a more orderly situation, where we should go to more lean situation in future quarters. And that's where we are in Latin America. The brand is so as I said, very strong. We market leaders in Argentina, we market leaders in Brazil, we market leaders in Chile as very big markets and market leaders in other countries as well.So that's an answer to that. And then, what I would ask you to do is, listen to the conference call, because I don't want to repeat numbers that we've already said, we're already running out of time, the Q will be out in in two days, and that should answer your questions on Latin America. Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Hi, guys. I just wanted to quickly circle back on gross margins and see if you could share what impacted out of orbit issue that you highlighted during your shareholder meeting, maybe head off margin and whether this issue is now resolved, essentially. And I just want to confirm that you guys are now back working within your orbit. Hilton Schlosberg: Yes, Bonnie, there always will be anomalies. And we're in the middle of summer, as you know, and it's been pretty hot out there. And we're doing our very best to stay within orbits, but there are anomalies from time to time and our mission in this company has always been to satisfy our customers. So yes, there will be, we maintaining within our orbits, but there are times when we will and we do stray from that. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks. Rodney Sacks: Thanks very much. On behalf of the company, I'd like to thank everyone for their continued interest. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad. And in particular capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca Cola Bottler system. We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company. We hope that you will remain safe and healthy and have enjoyable summer. Thank you very much for your attendance. Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.]"

66,c4335d14-f63d-38ea-a6cd-26df9e67f087,HCA,2023-08-05,‘We See Healthy Upside Ahead’: Billionaire Dan Loeb Uses These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks to Bet on Favorable Economic Conditions,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/see-healthy-upside-ahead-billionaire-010843691.html,1691111323,STORY,"['HCA', 'HTZ']","[Will it happen or not? That is the question economy observers have been grappling with over the past year regarding the prospect of a looming recession.But while not long ago the consensus was that one was all but inevitable – and a full-blown recession at that – the tune has changed more recently. Factoring in the resilient economy and the hasty retreat of prior alarming inflation levels, many financial experts now think that if a recession does materialize, it will be of the mild variety.One of those is billionaire Dan Loeb, who moving forward sees “continued favorable economic conditions driven by declining inflation.” And that should eventually result in less hawkish monetary policy.“While we recognize that consumers are vulnerable to the depletion of savings accumulated from fiscal stimulus and other pandemic-era emergency measures, we also see potential for the Fed to begin an easing cycle around the time American consumers begin to run low on cash, which should make for a mild recession,” the money manager said. “We also believe that since consumers and businesses (other than perhaps the commercial real estate industry) would be going into any economic slowdown with healthy balance sheets, the risk of a credit dislocation is minimal in the coming year, also reducing the risk of a severe recession.”With the outlook appearing favorable, then, it’s worth checking out Loeb’s portfolio to find which stocks he thinks are worth leaning into right now. After all, he is the founder and CEO of Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund that oversees $14 billion.Loeb thinks there is “healthy upside” ahead for his portfolio, and with this in mind, we ran two Loeb-favored tickers via the TipRanks database to see what Wall Street’s cadre of stock experts make of these picks. Turns out, they’re backing their chances too. Both are rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s check the details.Hertz Global (HTZ)We’ll first head to the car rental industry and one of the segment’s most well-known names: Hertz Global. It is one of the largest vehicle rental companies in the world, operating brands such as Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty vehicle rental. With a history spanning over a century, Hertz has built a vast network of rental locations across various countries, enabling it to serve millions of customers annually.Story continuesHowever, its recent history has not been without blemishes. Hertz was an early victim of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and went bankrupt in May 2020. It officially emerged from bankruptcy a little over a year later, in a much healthier state.The Q2 report can bear witness to that. The company generated adjusted Net Income of $227 million, equivalent to $0.72 per share, surpassing the Wall Street estimate of $0.64.Volume rose by 12% compared to the same period a year ago, benefiting from a utilization rate of 82%. Monthly revenue per unit in the quarter reached $1,516, marking a 230 basis points improvement compared to 2Q22.On the top line, revenue climbed 4% year-over-year to $2.44 billion, but it missed Street expectations by $10 million.The revenue miss, along with an adjusted EBITDA miss, did not sit well with investors, leading to a drop in shares following the report’s release.Meanwhile, Loeb is staying long and strong. His HTZ position consists of 6,350,000 shares, currently worth over $100 million.For investors seeking guidance after the post-earnings drop, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Moore has some simple advice.“What to do with HTZ shares?” the 5-star analyst asks, “Buy more if you believe it can see pricing and margins structurally higher vs. pre-COVID given improved rationality in the industry, as well as HTZ’s more ROA mindset and ongoing productivity/ cost initiatives. Beyond what continues to be a favorable industry backdrop (low supply/high demand), we’re bullish on its strategy to play in the EV/ Rideshare channel, as well as the LT opportunity regarding autonomous vehicles/managing fleets.”Quantifying this stance, Moore has a Buy rating on HTZ shares to go alongside a $22 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 38% from the current trading price. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? Most are. 4 Buys and 1 Hold have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: HTZ is a Strong Buy. Given the $23.60 average price target, shares could surge ~49% in the next year. (See HTZ stock forecast)HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA)Next up is a healthcare giant. HCA Healthcare is one of the largest and most prominent healthcare providers in the US. The company oversees a vast network of hospitals, surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, and other healthcare facilities, serving communities in numerous states across the country. In fact, by operating 182 acute care hospitals, it is the country’s biggest non-governmental operator of such facilities. HCA Healthcare concentrates its efforts on sizeable metropolitan areas that display positive prospects in terms of population characteristics and economic conditions.It’s a model that served the company well in its recently reported Q2 print. Boosted by strong demand for the services, revenue climbed by 7% year-over-year to $15.86 billion, in turn beating the Street’s call by $240 million. Likewise, at the other end of the equation, adj. EPS of $4.29 outpaced the $4.24 anticipated by the analysts.The outlook was good too. The company raised both its 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecast to $63.25 – $64.75 billion (from $62.5 – $64.5 billion) and $12.3 – $12.8 billion (from $12.1 – $12.7 billion), respectively. The analysts were looking for revenue of $63.4 billion and adj. EBITDA of $12.5 billion.As for Loeb’s involvement, he currently owns 860,000 shares, which command a market value of more than $232.8 million.HCA also gets the backing of Truist analyst David S. MacDonald, who after scanning the Q2 readout, has plenty of good things to say.“We remain bullish on HCA following 2Q results featuring solid volumes and top-line growth, adjusted EBITDA slightly ahead and raised FY guidance which points to stronger 2H trends. Labor continues to show improvement across metrics, and we expect ongoing volume momentum. Financial flexibility remains robust, providing ample flexibility for ongoing capital deployment/footprint expansion and the pipeline of projects is significant,” MacDonald opined.These comments underpin MacDonald’s Buy rating, while his $340 price target suggests shares will climb ~26% higher over the coming year. (To watch MacDonald’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, where other analysts are also mostly positive. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 Buys vs. 3 Holds. Going by the $311.77 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 15% premium.

This is Austin Neri, a member of the Investor Relations team for Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., and I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)Before we begin today's call, I would like to remind our listeners that today's remarks may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the company's control.The company's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these results -- and forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in the company's SEC filings. This audio cast is copyrighted material of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.Yesterday, after the market closed, the company issued an earnings press release and posted a supplemental earnings presentation, both of which can be found on the home page of our website at www.goldmansachsbdc.com, under the Investor Relations section and which include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These documents should be reviewed in conjunction with the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed yesterday with the SEC. This conference call is being recorded today, Friday, August 4, 2023, for replay purposes. I'll now turn the call over to Alex Chi, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.Story continuesAlex ChiThank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'm here today with David Miller, my Co-Chief Executive Officer; Tucker Greene, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Pessah, our Chief Financial Officer.I'll begin the call by providing a brief overview of our second quarter results before discussing the current market environment in more detail. I'll then turn the call over to David Miller to describe our portfolio activity before we hand it off to David Pessah to take us through our financial results. And then finally, we'll open the line for Q&amp;A. So with that, let's get to our second quarter results.Our net investment income per share for the quarter was $0.59, an increase of 28.3% from the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting in connection with the merger with MMLC, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $0.58 per share, equating to an annualized net investment income yield on book value of 15.9%. The increase in returns is largely a reflection of the increase in base rates during the quarter.As we announced after the market closed yesterday, our Board declared a $0.45 per share dividend payable to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2023. This marks the company's 34th consecutive quarter of a $0.45 per share dividend totaling $15.30 per share since our IPO, excluding the special dividends we paid in 2021 post the merger with MMLC. Net asset value per share increased to $14.59 per share as of June 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 1% from the end of the first quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase of net investment income as well as a modest increase in unrealized gains for the quarter.On a fair value basis, first lien loans are 92.6% of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2023, which speaks to our continued focus on maintaining a higher-quality portfolio. This quarter, we continue to invest only in directly originated first lien senior secured debt with no participation in the secondary market for broadly syndicated loans.In the first quarter, we expressed confidence that we will see increased deal volumes as the year progresses with visible green shoots in M&amp;A markets, a resurgence of take privates and refinancings as sponsors reengage private markets to address upcoming maturities. During the second quarter, some of those expectations came to fruition as we saw increased deal activity, mainly towards the tail end of the quarter and a higher level of activity has continued into the second half of the year-to-date. Of note, GSBD participated in the refinancing and recapitalization of Fullsteam and existing GSBD borrower. The Goldman Sachs private credit platform has been involved with the company since 2019. In 2021, our initial investment was repaid as part of a broader recapitalization of the company in which GSBD participated.GSBD participated again in the company's most recent $1 billion recapitalization that is expected to close this quarter. This serves as an example of our incumbency, allowing us to reset economics and terms to match the current market environment. Fullsteam is a holding company of verticalized software businesses that provide core business management software and payment capabilities to small- and medium-sized customers.Superior Environmental Solutions is another example of a new origination in the second quarter with the Goldman Sachs private credit platform had an existing incumbent position and GSBD was able to participate in financing the buyout of the business by a new financial sponsor. In general, we're pleased that we're able to take advantage of the additional investment capacity that was created through our equity offering this past March and higher repayment activity during the second quarter. We're more confident now that despite overall economic uncertainties that continue to persist deal volumes will continue to grow as companies seek more strategic opportunities and sponsors look to deploy what has grown to more than $1 trillion of dry powder. So with that, let me turn it over to my co-CEO, David Miller.David Nathan MillerThanks, Alex. During the quarter, we originated $86.0 million in new investment commitments to 4 new and 5 existing portfolio companies. Our new investment commitments were 100% in first lien senior secured loans. Sales and repayment activity totaled $24.9 million, primarily driven by the full repayment of investments in 2 portfolio companies. We are particularly pleased with the visibility we have to date of additional anticipated repayments in the second half of the year across a handful of portfolio companies. Two of these will further reduce our junior lien positions currently in the portfolio and more importantly, allow us to redeploy capital into new first lien oriented opportunities while remaining well within our leverage targets.Turning to portfolio composition. As of June 30, 2023, total investments in our portfolio were $3.6 billion at fair value, comprised of 97.5% senior secured loans, including 89.3% first lien, 3.3% in first lien/last-out unitranche and 4.9% second lien debt. This as well as a negligible amount of unsecured debt and 2.3% in a combination of preferred and common stock and warrants. We also had $366.1 million of unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2023, bringing total investments at fair value and commitments to $3.9 billion. As of quarter end, the company held investments in 135 portfolio companies, operating across 36 different industries. The weighted average yield of our investment portfolio at cost at the end of Q2 was 11.9% as compared to 11.6% from the prior quarter. The weighted average yield of our total debt and income-producing assets at amortized cost increased to 12.6% at the end of Q2 from 12.2% at the end of Q1.Turning to credit quality. The weighted average net debt-to-EBITDA of the companies in our investment portfolio declined slightly quarter-over-quarter to 5.9x compared to 6.0x in the first quarter. Given the level of existing base rates, we would anticipate that future originations and transactions should reflect lower leverage metrics. Just as importantly, and in response to questions some of you have had in regard to macro headwinds over the past few quarters, our portfolio companies had both top line and EBITDA growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter on a weighted average basis.We remain selective from a credit and risk-adjusted return perspective and maintain a long-term strategic view on capital deployment that is insulated by our orientation to first lien credit risk. The weighted average interest coverage of the companies in our investment portfolio at quarter end was 1.6x, which was flat yet again as compared to Q1 '23 and Q4 '22, despite an increase in the overall [sulfur] yield curve. It is important to note that we calculate our coverage ratios based on current quarter metrics rather than a trailing or LTM basis. Where we to use the LTM calculation then our interest coverage of the companies in our investment portfolio would be 1.9x.And finally, turning to asset quality. As of June 30, 2023, despite 2 positions that were designated as Grade 3 last quarter being placed on nonaccrual during Q2. Investments on nonaccrual status amounted to 0.8% and 1.8% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and amortized costs, respectively; versus 0.6% and 1.6% at fair value and amortized costs, respectively, as of March 31, 2023.I will now turn the call over to David Pessah to walk through our financial results.David PessahThank you, David. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $3.6 billion, outstanding debt just under $2 billion and net assets of $1.6 billion. Our ending net debt-to-equity ratio at the end of Q2 remained at the same level of 1.2x, which continues to be below our target leverage range of 1.25x. At quarter end, approximately 44% of the company's total principal amount of debt outstanding was in unsecured debt and had $595 million of capacity available under our secured revolving credit facility. With our leverage ratios remaining below our targeted range, dry powder in our credit facility and the aforementioned repayments, this will allow us to deploy capital into attractive risk-adjusted opportunities in the current market. Before continuing to the income statement, as a reminder, in addition to GAAP financial measures, we will also reference certain non-GAAP or adjusted measures. This is intended to make the company's financial results easier to compare to results to our October 2020 merger with MMLC. These non-GAAP measures remove the purchase discount amortization impact from our financial results. For Q2, GAAP and adjusted after-tax net investment income were $64.5 million and $63.1 million, respectively, as compared to $48 million and $47.1 million, respectively, in the prior quarter. The increase in quarter-over-quarter top line investment income was primarily due to the increase in base rates. On a per share basis, GAAP net investment income was $0.59 and adjusted net investment income was $0.58 as compared to $0.46 and $0.45, respectively, last quarter. As a reminder, our incentive fee last quarter was elevated due to results from Q1 2020 being removed from the calculation. Those results included the initial impact of COVID-19 and meaningfully limited the amount of incentive fees that could be earned during the trailing 12-quarter period. For the current quarter, we saw the inverse effect which removed the results from Q2 2020, which included the rebound from the impact of COVID-19 during the trailing 12-quarter period. Distributions during the quarter remained consistent at $0.45. Our spillover taxable income is approximately $100.6 million or $0.92 on a per share basis, which we believe provides continuous stability on our consistent dividend since inception. Net asset value per share on June 30, 2023, was $14.59 as compared to $14.44 last quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Alex for closing remarks.Alex ChiThanks, David. In conclusion, thank you all for joining us on our call. As mentioned, we're encouraged that new deal activity along with increased repayments will allow us to continue capturing attractive investment opportunities. We appreciate your time and attention today. With that, let's open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Derek Hewett with Bank of America.Derek Russell HewettCongrats on the good quarter. Maybe my first question is, could you remind me about the dividend policy because the core dividend has been flat for quite some time now when most peers have increased the dividend to some degree given the rise of rates. And especially just looking at earnings, you factor in the first half earnings run rate plus the additional tailwinds that you described earlier in terms of accelerating originations, it would suggest that this year could be at or near kind of record core earnings.Alex ChiThanks for the question. As we think about our policy, we like to maintain stability in terms of what our fixed dividend is. So we remained at $0.45 since inception. I think we want to maintain that level of certainty in terms of how our dividend policy does work. In terms of the special, we're taking a long-term view of how to manage our balance sheet accordingly. Looking at what our spillover is with future run rates, and we'll be opportunistic to the extent that it makes sense from a shareholder perspective to potentially issue a special down the road. But something that we're evaluating and we'll continuously assess and what makes the best sense for the balance sheet and shareholders.Derek Russell HewettOkay. And then looking at Slide 7, it looked like there was a significant -- somewhat of a sizable move from risk -- to risk category 3, at least on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Could you talk about that migration and the prospect of potential further migration to that risk level 4 category?Alex ChiSure. And thanks for the question. So that migration was really driven by a couple of names that we're facing some liquidity pressures during the quarter. And we were in active discussions with the sponsors during the quarter. We expect them to support these companies. But because it was unresolved, we thought it was prudent to downgrade those investments from rating Category 2 to rating Category 3. And I think you've gotten to know us, we were quite conservative with respect to how we look at our ratings categories. So as soon as those -- the situations are hopefully resolved shortly, we'll reflect them appropriately.Derek Russell HewettOkay. And then my last question is just in terms of the pipeline, how would you describe it in just in terms of the yield and leverage turns relative to the existing portfolio? It seems like the terms are even more attractive today than what you currently have in your legacy book.Alex ChiYes, certainly, compared to the legacy book, the terms that we're seeing today are very attractive in comparison. The average spreads that we're seeing right now in the private credit market still are in 600s. We have seen some spread compression quarter-to-quarter just given the supply-demand dynamics in the private credit market. But having said that, leverage levels are still lower versus the legacy book, as you saw, the leverage levels continue to tick down, and that's really driven by the higher borrowing costs that sponsors face with the portfolio of companies. And so -- having said that, the overall yields are quite attractive versus the legacy book, which is why we're very excited about our position right now where we've created capacity to make new investments in the current environment. As you saw, we saw an increased level of repayment activity in the quarter, and we have visibility into a significant amount of repayments that are coming already due to enough activity. You can probably see that from the increased number of companies that we put in the rating Category 1. And so we're going to be able to repay those legacy investments and reinvest them into much more attractive yielding opportunities.David Nathan MillerAnd on top of that, I would just add that we're seeing the pipeline pick up pretty dramatically when you -- particularly at the end of the second quarter going into the third quarter. Our pipeline is picked up, activity is picking up. So we're seeing a number of very attractive investment opportunities to reinvest that capital into as we look forward over the quarter.OperatorWe'll go next to Maxwell Fritsche with Truist Securities.Maxwell FritscherI'm calling in today for Mark Hughes. I had a broad question about just the credit facility. I was wondering what you all experience has been recently with lenders. And if you've noticed that any banks have increased or maintained their appetite towards living to BDCs?Alex ChiYes. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our facility, we kind of -- and how we think about it, we have a wide underline book in terms of who's involved in our credit facilities. We've had across our platform, 4 different launch corporate revolvers, all leading with the same bank. And then repeat syndicate banks that are associated with it. So we've been fostering a long-term relationship across the board and continue to have the active dialogue and relationships with them that allow us to have active and continued dialogue with our financial providers and feel pretty comfortable with who are using it, who's involved with our platform.Maxwell FritscherAnd for the weighted average interest coverage ratio, I think you mentioned it was for the portfolio of companies 1.6x. I was wondering if you could provide the percentage of the companies that were under 1x the interest coverage ratio.Alex ChiYes. And for weighted average, it was roughly 3%.OperatorWe'll go next to Sean-Paul Adams with Raymond James.Sean-Paul Aaron AdamsI apologize if this is already said, I joined the call a little bit late, but can you guys shed a little bit of light on the percentage of your portfolio and the total number of companies that have been interest coverage trading below 1x and generally, your views on interest coverage as the rate environment continues to trend higher?Alex ChiYes. So for your first part of the question, under 1 is roughly around 3%.David Nathan MillerYes. On the second part, just the interest coverage has remained stable. It's right at 1.6x, which was flat with the prior quarter. And part of that is driven by the way we calculate it, which is current quarter. So we wouldn't expect much change on a going-forward basis from an interest coverage perspective. That's also in conjunction with and you take a look at the underlying portfolio of companies, they continue to grow both top line and EBITDA on a quarter-over-quarter basis to support increased borrowing costs.OperatorAnd at this time, there are no further questions.Alex ChiThank you, everyone, for joining our call, and have a great weekend.David Nathan MillerThank you, everyone.]"

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark. Kevin Clark: Thank you, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Beginning on Slide 3. We delivered a record quarter, demonstrating outperformance in an improving supply chain environment. Touching on a few of the highlights. Revenue increased 25% to $5.2 billion, a new record for quarterly revenue, representing 10 points of growth over underlying vehicle production, driven by strong demand across our portfolio as well as across all geographic regions. Revenues in our active safety and high-voltage electrification product line increased almost 50%, underscoring the strength of our safe, green, and connected product portfolio. EBITDA and operating income totaled a record $695 million and $530 million, respectively, reflecting solid flows on volume growth and fewer supply chain disruptions. Partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and ongoing material and labor inflation. New business bookings totaled $6.1 billion, further validating our industry-leading portfolio, the strength of our customer relationships, and our ability to execute flawlessly in a dynamic environment. Turning to Slide 4. Our first half performance substantially in line with our expectations. New business bookings totaled over $20 billion, driven by customer awards for our SBA compute and software, high-voltage electrification, user experience, and active safety solutions. Record revenue, representing 20% growth, 8 points over underlying vehicle production, in line with our long-term framework, record EBITDA and operating income as well as significant year-over-year margin expansion. The result of strong volume growth and increased operating efficiencies, partially offset by the headwinds I mentioned on the prior slide. And we're ahead of plan for both Wind River and Intercable Automotive solutions with both companies experiencing an uptick in commercial engagements and customer awards. Although supply chain issues persist we experienced a sequential improvement in the supply of semiconductors resulting in more stable vehicle production schedules. From a macro and industry perspective, global vehicle production has been strong, with the North American and European markets being the most resilient. Given the current industry backdrop, we're updating our outlook for the full year. We now expect global vehicle production to increase 3% to 4%, principally driven by stronger vehicle production in North America and Europe. Our updated outlook does not take into account any labor disruption in North America, although we do recognize that this is a real risk. Joe will provide a more granular update on our revised outlook when we review the financials. Regardless of the market backdrop, we remain laser-focused on enhancing our portfolio of safe, green, and connected solutions, executing on our commercial strategy, and optimizing our business model, which will continue to position us to benefit from the secular tailwinds. Moving to Slide 5. As I already mentioned, new business bookings during the quarter were $6.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to over $20 billion. Advanced Safety and User Experience bookings totaled $1.7 billion, driven by $1 billion in user experience bookings, including awards for Aptiv's integrated cockpit controller and driver state sensing solutions. Signal and Power Solutions bookings reached $4.4 billion, including $1.4 billion in bookings for our high-voltage electrification solutions comprised of awards across our high-voltage product portfolio, with both traditional and new battery electric vehicle manufacturers. Given the strength of our commercial pipeline, we have clear line of sight to exceed last year's $4.2 billion in high-voltage business awards, and we remain highly confident in achieving our full-year earnings target of $32 billion. further validating the strength of our portfolio of advanced technologies and our ability to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Turning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's second quarter highlights. ASUX achieved record revenue of $1.5 billion, increasing 24 points above underlying vehicle production. Active safety revenues increased 49%, with strength across North America, Europe, and China as the launch of our Level 2 and Level 2+ ADAS solutions continue to ramp. User Experience revenues increased 33%, driven by volume growth across key programs in both Europe and North America. And lastly, smart vehicle compute and software revenue grew 30%, reflecting Wind River's commercial success in both the automotive and nonautomotive markets, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. In terms of new business bookings, we were awarded over $400 million of active safety bookings, including program extension awards with a North American customer. As I mentioned, we're also awarded roughly $1 billion of user experience bookings, including a significant program extension with the VW Group. This particular award is for an integrated cockpit controller first launch on the Porsche Taycan and now being rolled out across numerous other vehicle platforms. As vehicle life cycles get shorter the ability to cost effectively extend our solutions across both luxury and mass market vehicle platforms, reinforces Aptiv's value as a strategic partner. And as demand increases for more advanced active safety and user experience solutions, the need for more advanced compute, software development and integration capabilities as required. Our ability to provide a full suite of flexible platform solutions that are cost-effective, while providing our customers with choice, differentiates us from our competitors. And as a result, we've experienced an increase in the number of strategic customer engagements and are confident that additional business awards will follow later this year. Moving to Slide 7. Wind River delivers edge-to-cloud software solutions for mission-critical applications, enabling software to find systems that require the highest levels of safety, security, and performance. The Wind River team has done a great job increasing the partner ecosystem while also winning new business, particularly in the aerospace and defense, telecom, and automotive markets, including a new program award for an A&amp;D customer GMV to provide its edge software and with a global European truck manufacturer to provide its Linux edge software and services for their next-generation communication gateway, providing a nice entree into the commercial vehicle market. The Wind River team continues to be actively engaged with several automotive customers on enabling the software-defined vehicle of the future. In addition, they've announced several new partnerships to expand their ecosystem, including with Samsung to develop a fully integrated software and hardware solution for the automotive industry. This solution will be enabled by Wind River's Helix virtualization platform, which will allow end users to utilize a diverse set of runtime environments, including the VxWorks RTOS, Linux, and Android. Last month, the team also announced a strategic collaboration with Horizon Robotics to provide Wind River's complete edge-to-cloud portfolio for Verizon's automated driving compute solutions for the China market. These partnerships in automotive, along with Wind River's continued commercial success, in its traditional markets, allow Aptiv to capitalize on the transition to a more software-defined future. Together with Wind River, Aptiv is well positioned to provide cloud-native software solutions that help customers reduce complexity, while enabling flexibility, lower total system cost, faster speed to market, and new business models. In order to provide you with a deeper look at our software strategy, and the value that we can deliver to customers, we'll be hosting a software teaching in September. We're excited to tell you more about the Active Win River opportunity, and we'll provide more details as we get closer to the date. Turning to the Signal and Power Solutions segment on Slide 8. S&amp;PS second quarter revenues increased 21%, 6 points over vehicle production, the result of strong revenue growth in China as we lapped the COVID disruptions during the second quarter last year, a 48% increase in high-voltage revenues, reflecting strong growth across all regions and product lines, and a 32% increase in commercial vehicle revenues. The $1.4 billion in high-voltage bookings that I mentioned previously included another strong quarter from Intercable Automotive, which I'll touch on in more detail on the next slide. Multiple awards with the Hyundai Motor Group, including for both power distribution and battery pack electrical architecture, High Voltage Electrical Center award, a global European truck manufacturer, further increasing our penetration of the commercial vehicle market as it begins to transition to battery electric vehicle platforms. Moving to Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, we're on our way to exceeding last year's record of $4.2 billion of high-voltage bookings. We continue to enhance the breadth of our high-voltage product portfolio as we introduce new offerings in power electronics and battery management systems. And the addition of Intercable Automotive solutions expands our portfolio to include high-voltage bus bars, solid-state electrical centers, and battery cell interconnect solutions, further widening our competitive moat. We expect Intercable revenues to increase roughly 30% per year over the next several years, strengthening our position as the only full system provider of high-voltage solutions. With approximately $1 billion in bookings, year-to-date Intercable has already exceeded its 2022 full-year bookings amount. And their pipeline for 2023 new business award is now more than $2 billion, validation of the strength of their best-in-class high-voltage electrification technologies. Already a market leader with European customers, Intercable recently launched production from one of Aptiv's facilities in North America, with customer deliveries scheduled to begin this quarter. In addition to what Interconnect brings, we continue to experience significant commercial interest in our growing portfolio of power electronics and battery management system solutions for both battery producers and high-volume battery electric vehicle manufacturers. With our unique portfolio of high-voltage solutions and full system capabilities, we're perfectly positioned to be the partner of choice for customers around the world as they transition to an optimized electrified vehicle architecture. Moving to Slide 10. Before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to take a minute to recognize an important achievement by the Aptiv team. In July, Aptiv was recognized by Volkswagen with the prestigious VW Group Award one of just a handful of suppliers. Aptiv was chosen for more than 40,000 suppliers for the top spot in the category of Global Performance Champion recognition for our product innovation and ability to keep Volkswagen connected during these challenging times. The VW and Aptiv strategies are fully aligned and our teams have been working closely over the last three years to design and develop the vehicle architecture that will enable the software-defined vehicle of the future. The Aptiv team is extremely proud of this award and looks forward to continuing to innovate and further strengthen our long-standing and strategic partnership with the VW Group. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to go through the numbers in more detail. Joe Massaro: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 11. As Kevin highlighted, Aptiv reported another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting robust execution across both segments and continued improvement in operating performance. Revenues were up 25% to $5.2 billion or 10% above underlying vehicle production, excluding the impact of acquisitions. With outgrowth driven in part by strength in our ASUX segment, particularly in active safety as well as continued traction in our high-voltage and commercial vehicle product lines. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $695 million and $530 million, respectively, reflecting flow-through on increased volumes of approximately 30%, continued progress on our ongoing performance initiatives, including a $70 million improvement in supply chain disruption costs from last year, and margin headwinds of 90 basis points from FX and commodities primarily due to the stronger Mexican peso and weaker Chinese RMB. Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.25, an increase of $1.03 from the prior year, driven by higher operating income, which more than offset the negative FX and commodity impact. Operating cash was $535 million, which was $440 million above the same period last year, primarily driven by higher earnings and reduced working capital investment during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $222 million. Looking at revenues in more detail on Slide 12. The Revenue in the second quarter was a record $5.2 billion, representing adjusted growth of 25%. Growth was broad-based across regions and segments and our recent acquisitions added $176 million of revenue in the quarter. Net price and commodities were positive, more than offsetting the FX impact on revenue. From a regional perspective, North American revenues were up 19%, 4% above market, reflecting program timing at several customers with increased launch activity expected in the second half of the year. In Europe, revenues increased by 28%, 14% above market, supported by growth in active safety and user experience. In China, revenues grew 41% or 20% over market reflecting the strength of our underlying product portfolio, particularly in active safety and high voltage. Moving to the segments on the next slide. Advanced Safety User Experience revenues rose 39% in the quarter were 24 points over vehicle production. The outperformance was driven by strength in several product lines, including active safety where revenues were up 49%. Segment adjusted operating income was $138 million, up $168 million when compared to the same period last year, despite a 90-basis points headwind from FX, with strong flow-through on incremental volumes of approximately 30% as well as net price and operating performance that offset higher material and higher labor costs. Signal and Power revenues were up 21%, 6 points above market. Market outperformance was driven by strength in several key product lines, including high-voltage and commercial vehicle. Segment operating income totaled $392 million, up 61% from the prior year despite an FX and commodity headwind of 90 basis points. Driven by strong flow-through on incremental volumes, offsetting the net price and commodities impact as well as improvements in operating performance to lower disruption costs, which more than offset the impact of higher labor costs in the quarter. Turning to Slide 14 and our updated 2023 macro outlook. We've increased our outlook for adjusted growth to 11% to 13% for the full year, a meaningful increase from our original range of 7% to 9%, and we continue to expect to outgrow the market by 9%. The change in outlook primarily reflects increases in customer production schedules in North America and Europe, resulting in vehicle production growth of approximately 4% and 5% at the midpoint, respectively. Please note that our production outlook does not assume any significant North American labor disruptions. We expect China to be essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, in line with our prior guide. Although we continue to see strong EV penetration, particularly with our Chinese OEM customers. In addition to changes in vehicle production volumes, we have also reflected current foreign exchange and commodity rates into the updated guide. The next slide summarizes our updated 2023 outlook. We now expect revenue in the range of $19.95 billion to $20.25 billion. EBITDA and operating income are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion and $2.1 billion at the midpoint, respectively. This reflects year-over-year operating income flow-through of 21%, in line with our historical range of 18% to 22% despite significant FX and commodity headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.75 at the midpoint, up almost 40% from prior year, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher tax and interest expense. Operating cash flow of approximately $2 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over the prior guidance. Slide 16 walks prior guidance to our current outlook. Starting with revenue. Sales volume increases by $700 million, reflecting higher European and North American customer schedules. Net price, commodities, and foreign exchange contributed positively to revenue driven by the rate changes I previously discussed. Adjusted operating income is up $125 million over prior guide as flow-through on sales growth and higher operating performance is partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the timing of copper price adjustments to our customers. Net pricing, which includes the impact of customer price downs price recoveries and material inflation remains in line with our original guidance. As previously discussed, the impact of foreign exchange movements, particularly the stronger pace for weaker RMB, have been significant this year, representing a $100 million headwind to the original guide. However, assuming rates for the balance of the year remain relatively consistent with the rates used in our updated guidance, including a stronger euro that partially offset a peso and RMB impact, we believe the majority of the negative impact has been reflected in the first half results. In summary, we are pleased with Aptiv's year-to-date performance, including the continued growth of our key product lines, strong bookings, and continued margin expansion. Our performance initiatives, including efforts to significantly reduce and ultimately eliminate disruption costs and to offset significant labor inflation are on track and will continue to build throughout the year. Although we remain cautious about potential negative macroeconomic conditions over the next few quarters and the potential for labor disruptions in North America, we remain confident in our ability to meaningfully outgrow vehicle production. We also believe we are well positioned to take advantage of stronger market conditions should be noted concerns not materialize. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for closing remarks. Kevin Clark: Thanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 17 before opening the line for questions. 2023 is off to a good start with record first half revenues, EBITDA and operating income, and strong margin expansion. We maintained our momentum on new business awards for optimized full-system solutions that deliver increased performance at lower cost to our customers. Our outlook for industry volumes has increased and easing supply constraints have led to fewer production disruptions and improved operating efficiencies. And we continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure to further enhance our operational resiliency. Our culture of innovation and commitment to keeping our customers connected is clearly translating into strong commercial momentum, which gives us confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, maintain our track record of performance and deliver sustainable value creation for our shareholders. Operator, let's now open the line for questions. See also 10 Oversold Bank Stocks To Buy and 10 Oversold Small Cap Stocks To Buy.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the information this morning. Just a simple question first on ASUX. It seems like you suddenly just kind of got into escape velocity here. And I'm just curious if that's kind of a fair statement, particularly with these margins at 9%, they're weigh down by some other factors. So, I mean, on a normalized basis, they're actually reapproaching 10%. In the ramp-up of some of these growth segments, I mean, is this where we should be thinking sort of the travel rate for margins? Or is there something else going on in the quarter other than just this kind of escape velocity being reached? Kevin Clark: Yes. John, it's -- I'll start and Joe certainly should add to it. Clearly, the environment for semiconductors and supply chain associated with semiconductors has improved. I think as an industry with the semiconductor manufacturers, we've been working over the last couple of years to enhance visibility to enhance alternatives or choices. And with the slowdown in some of the consumer electronics markets, it certainly freed up incremental supply. As a result, it's made our supply chain much more efficient, which results in lower cost from a manufacturing standpoint as well as from a freight and other standpoint, that's reflected in our numbers to date. And then we would expect that to continue into the -- obviously, into the back half of the year as we lower -- Sorry, it sounds like we had a little feedback. As we have lower disruption costs, more operating efficiency, we are able to operate more efficiently and then continue into 2024 and beyond. John Murphy : Okay. And then just one follow-up on Intercable using that sort of as a test case for some of these acquisitions that you're making. I mean it sounds like you can't sell this or explain it well enough at how the -- or the expansion opportunity is in front of you for Intercable. I'm just curious in the current base of customers, and the $1 billion that's been won year-to-date or booked year-to-date, are we still looking at a European centric revenue base as far as the customers and there's just extreme opportunity in other regions and with other automakers outside of the European automakers. I'm just trying to understand where this is ultimately going to go. Kevin Clark: Yes. I make sure I understand the question. I think today, the bulk of their revenues are related to European unbalanced programs. But as we talked about, previously. One of the reasons that we acquired Intercable is in addition to their technical capabilities and their broad portfolio a view that we could easily provide them with entrees into the North America market, which we've done to date, as I mentioned in our prepared comments, we're already producing products in one of Aptiv's existing manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Then we'll be delivering product to a North American OEM starting this quarter, and we see significant opportunities with the other North American OEMs. And then similarly, with China, although they have manufacturing capabilities in China, just given our knowledge of the market and our experience there, we feel as though that we -- we're a great leverage point for them to sell their product into that market as well. So, as I mentioned, their funnel for bookings opportunities is well over $2 billion. So, the opportunities are really significant with Intercable. They have a great portfolio. They have an even stronger management team. So, we're really excited about the acquisition. John Murphy : Great. Thank you, very much. Operator: We will take our next question from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks, and good morning everybody. Just two questions for me. Just first, I was hoping you could just walk through the how you think about the H2 versus H1 margin bridge embedded in your guidance? And then just secondly, I didn't notice restructuring expenses kind of moved up in Q2. I think you raised your outlook there. Maybe just hopefully you could elaborate on where you're seeing these restructuring opportunities? And how much more of the lever that could be going forward for margin expansion?Joe Massaro : Yes. Let me start with that and then I go to H1, H2 Itay. I would say that, that is -- we've talked about that, not necessarily in the context of the restructured dollars, but things like pivoting engineering to best-cost countries those types of activities, it's obviously what you're seeing. And as we laid out at Investor Day, particularly with engineering, that's really the established margin guidance into 2025, right? So, I would think of that as us taking the necessary actions over time to continue to move toward that commitment versus something incremental. From a bridge perspective, from an H1 to H2, I'm not going to give a lot of detail, but you're going to see a couple of things. There's a slight volume uptick, a little less than $100 million. That sort of flows at call it, 30% on volume. FX will be better. We had about -- be better by about $30 million. We don't expect that these current rates to have as much transaction hits as we did in the first half as we adjusted down. And then you've got, what I'll call, performance initiatives as well as some inflation recovery, that's going to be over $100 million. That's really the big bucket. Some of that's coming out of disruption costs. The other, as I noted, is going to be a continued march on these performance initiatives that we've talked about, and they'll continue to improve over the back half of the year. Itay Michaeli : Perfect. I appreciate all that detail. Thank you. Operator: We will now move to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache: Good morning, everybody. Had to just ask you kind of a couple of big picture things. One is in the margin bridge that you presented from 2022 to 2025 at your Investor Day, you had a bucket of $1.7 billion. It was -- I think you called it performance. It was elimination of COVID costs, part of it was some supplier costs. Can you just update us on where that bucket stands now? And what proportion of that $1.7 billion you think we will actually see in 2023? Joe Massaro : Yes, Rod, it's Joe. Let me start. So, remember that Bucket big -- that was a '22 to '25 bridge, right? So, you had -- the biggest individual item in that $1.7 billion is about over $300 million, call it, $330 million to $350 million of supply chain disruption costs. We expected a lot of that to come out this year. We had $130 million in the original guide. It's improved now, maybe around $160 million coming out this year. The balance will come out next year. The remaining is just sort of what I'll call sort of those annual material and manufacturing improvements for the three years, '23, '24, '25. I would say you could sort of take those across each of the years. They're a little back-end loaded. They grow into '24 and '25. But for the most part, we're on track. It's really what you're seeing sort of come through in the performance bridges as we've talked, just even over the past -- this past quarter, right, $70 million improvement in supply chain disruption costs alone. So, I might say we're tracking in line with those expectations. Rod Lache: Thanks, for that. Okay. And just switching gears. A few western companies seem to have lately realized that the EV forms that they were working on were just too expensive and we've already seen Volkswagen reach out to Xiaoping to use their platform and seemingly, there's a few other discussions in the industry about using Chinese platforms. So, I'm just wondering from Aptiv's perspective, how you -- how that affects you. You did mention again on the call that you've been working with Volkswagen on the architecture of the future. So, would you be agnostic to that? Or is there some -- are there some implications for you if that is something that continues? Kevin Clark: Yes, Rod, maybe I'll start with it. Listen, I think as we've talked about in the past, our overall outlook for penetration of battery electric vehicles and electrification overall has been -- I'd say, a bit on the conservative side relative to kind of industry perspective. So that has been our underlying perspective and a significant amount of that perspective is shaped on costs and an understanding of our OEM customers and sensitivity to cost and sensitivity to the cost of new technologies. So that's one. Two, just given the breadth of our product portfolio, given our full system approach to high-voltage electrification in this particular case, we have an opportunity to present our customers with a solution that is much lower cost than a traditional approach to battery electric vehicle architecture.And we've had examples, and we've talked about this in the past, where existing customers with existing -- both platforms have come to us, ask us to evaluate opportunities to optimize. And using our design capabilities and our portfolio of solutions, we've been able to reduce weight and mass by 25% to 30% and overall systems cost by 20% or more. So, given our historical capabilities given our strength, and from a product portfolio standpoint and our knowledge of vehicle architecture, we bring a lot to bear. I'd say the third piece as we've talked about this transition to battery electric vehicles, which in reality has been underway for a long period of time, and we've seen elements of fits and starts during that period. And we've been impacted by those fits and starts. We've been very selective as it relates to those customers, those platforms that we operate on. And we operate on those that we have a high level of confidence they'll be global. They're designed specifically for battery electric vehicle platforms; therefore, we'll get volume. And then from a contracting standpoint, we contract very carefully to the extent we see volume reductions, there are changes in pricing. So just given our past experience, again, as we've seen battery electric vehicles developed and the attempt to introduce some into the markets for the last several years, we've learned a lot of lessons, and we've lessons -- and we've established a really, I would say, a fairly conservative approach in terms of how do we manage risk, but at the same time, how do we develop a portfolio capability that provides our customers with lower cost solutions because we are big believers that over a period of time, you're going to continue to see significant penetration of electrification in our industry. Rod Lache: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you. Operator: We will take our next question from Chris McNally from Evercore. Please go ahead. Chris McNally : Maybe I could start on the top line and macro. I know it gets kind of confusing, talking about North America with the upcoming UAW. So maybe Joe, we can focus in on Europe. Just some quick numbers on the 4% to 6% production, which is lower than the forecasters, I think we have something like 15%, 16% in the first half, so it implies down in the second half, obviously, inflation prices and cost of living, et cetera. But curious if your seeing anything specific. You obviously have a lot of insight there or is there's just a bit of conservatism built in for the next couple of months as schedules firm up? Joe Massaro : Yes. Chris, it's a good place to start. I would say Q3, we're on production schedules, right? So, we're sort of locked in at this point with our customers, and we've obviously have been through July. Certainly, and as I said in my prepared remarks, certainly, to the extent there is more production in the back half of the year, I think we'd certainly benefit from it, remaining a little cautious, just given all the -- all the potential sort of macro ups and downs. It's still. The environment is not perfect. It's still a challenging environment. It's -- as Kevin said, it's much better. But yes, a little bit of caution and -- but more in the fourth quarter than in the third. And third, we're fairly locked in at this point on customer schedules. Chris McNally: That's really helpful. And if I could just follow up some numbers to Mark's comments on ASUX where the margin progression does seem like it's starting to take off. I think from your 8% to 9% a full year it sort of implies the back half roughly 10%. So, we usually because of some of the price issues we can sort of use it as like a base, and you have a 13.5% -- 13% to 13.5% target for '25. Given that I think that $190 million you just laid out in recovery, a lot of that will come in ASUX assuming that we have, okay, up small, low single-digit volumes next year that we can kind of split the difference, and start to think about '24 being somewhere in between the halfway point of that 10%, and let's call it 13.5%. Or is there anything that takes longer, why it would be more of a back-end loaded 13% plus margin in '25? Joe Massaro : Yes. We--I'm not going to get into '24. It's a little too early in the year to do this. I think we remain confident in the '25 numbers for both total active as well as the segments. I would think it will be a steady march of continued volume growth in the key product lines, continued improvement. The price -- the team has done a good job on inflation recoveries. The environment, you could still have lumpy quarters between then and 2025 but feel like it's going to be a pretty steady march. Exactly where 2024 falls out, it's obviously something we've got to work out. But as we look at what's rolling on in that business, increase software content, those types of things still remain confident in that 2025 range. Chris McNally: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator: We will take our next question from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. Kevin, I thought your answer to Rob answer, a question -- there's a bit of an echo. On the pulling back on the more conservative EV targets given your experience was really well done. I guess if I follow up on that if there was a scenario where your 2025, and then longer-term EVs assumptions were really dominated by Tesla and the Chinese, like I'm thinking 5% plus share of the EV market being those two regimes, would that be mix adverse for you? Or, Yes. I just kind of leave that open-ended, but just kind of think -- curious how you would approach that level of concentration because there may be some scenarios where there's a win or take most on these global platforms. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Kevin Clark : Yes. I'm not going to talk about specific customers, Adam. I would say when you look at -- our revenue mix by region were pretty balanced between North America, Europe, and China growth opportunities in China, I'd say on a relative basis, are more significant. So, from a funnel standpoint, any bookings opportunity standpoint, that is an area that we're -- we're very focused on. Your comment on a winner take all. Our China high-voltage or BEV customers are very focused not only on the China market but increasingly regarding exports into other markets, which I think is a part of what you're alluding to. China customers from a system standpoint tend to be more clients to buy a full system solution for us -- from us. So, that tends to be a higher margin solution relative to selling component parts. So, I'm not sure if that's a net benefit for us or just a net neutral. Adam Jonas : Okay, Kevin. And either Kevin or Joe, on Motional, can you give us the latest update on the capital need there in terms of cash consumption? And then what have you got left in the tank before we need to put more in the kitty? Thanks. Joe Massaro : Yes. Yes. No, Adam, no changes on that front since the last couple of quarters. They have cash through or at least into Q2 of next year, and continue to make progress on the technical and commercial side of things. And as we've said previously, probably not the most receptive capital market at this point. Obviously, our partner, Hyundai, and ourselves are looking at it. I had to call it today, I'd say the partners fund another year of operations. I haven't made that decision yet, but that would be the most likely outcome. I think if we had to call it today, and they're going through about $500 million, $550 million of cash per year. So, it would be a split of that. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Joe thanks, Kevin. Joe Massaro : Thank you. Operator: We will take our next question from Dan Levy from Barclays. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning, and thank you, for taking the question. First, I wanted to just ask on commodities. It was -- you noted it was a headwind in the quarter. Maybe you could just provide us, Joe, with a bit more color on what the drag in the quarter was related to? And more broadly, what are you seeing in semis? Is there -- it sounds like the environment is getting better, it's more stable. Is there any path to relief on the cost pressures that you saw in recent years in semiconductors? Joe Massaro : So, two distinct questions there. Let me take commodities. For us, commodities is still mainly copper, sort of nothing -- nothing's changed over the last couple of years of that. We copper, we're indexed to copper with our customers for the vast majority, 80% of our copper buy those prices get adjusted either quarterly or in some cases, semiannually, we have one customer or a large customer, we actually do monthly. So, all we're dealing with there is really the lag. How much copper do we have in at a certain price before we can pass it along or before we can, in this case, increase the prices. So, you wind up with that lag every once in a while. And copper tends to be more of a margin rate impact in margin dollars. As it relates to semi, we've obviously passed along the price increases that we have received to date. We've been sort of direct a chip goes up, we pass that cost along to our customers. We will continue to do that as if and when we see additional inflation coming in the year. I would tell you at this point, don't see any indications of chip prices coming down. And I think if you look at least in some of the chip folks that are -- have a large automotive presence, I think they've been sort of echoing that, at least the potential to hold or maybe even go up in some of their public comments. So, we remain vigilant. We would expect to pass additional price increases through to our customers, but certainly don't see any downside on those prices at this point. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. And then just a related question. If we zoom out and look at the last few years, obviously, the results have been dragged by all the material inflation headwinds, largely semiconductors. And I assume that when you're booking your bookings that pricing is based on the commodity or input cost outlook at that time, and obviously, it's progressed to be a bit tougher since then. So, what steps are you taking to ensure that -- as your backlog rolls on, as that becomes revenue and launches that you're going to get the appropriate pricing to ensure that the margins are in line with what you'd like them to be as opposed to being dragged maybe by an input cost outlook from a prior time. Joe Massaro : So, Dan, we've talked about this a couple of times before. So, the renegotiation on price with customers covered in-process products, right, products that were being manufactured and things that were near launch, call it, within sort of 12 months plus to launch. For programs that are longer further out from a start date perspective, we have the opportunity, and we've done this even before semiconductors prices have gone up typically, before we really start to put capital on the ground, right, you got a sort of a two-year to three-year window before program start, there are various touch point customers around the economics of the program. Customers need that. We want that. Suppliers want that. Those tended historically to have been around volumes, right?If a program looks like it's going to be significantly higher in volume, the OEM wants to have a discussion, if it's going to be lower in volume, the supplier wants to have a discussion. Bond costs are historically part of those. So, as we get up to the point of starting production or putting capital to work to start production, we have a mechanism in place and the team does a good job at it to go back to customers on the overall economics of the program and bond costs are going to obviously now are included in that have always been but are now sort of at the top of the list, particularly with semiconductors of things that get discussed. And sorted out to get the program back to the original economic deal that was struck. Kevin Clark : Dan, if I could add one comment? I think Joe did a great job explaining how we contract and how we operate with our customers. At the same time, right, the last couple of years, there's been a lot of focus on, one, keeping our employees safe and then more recently, obviously, just supply chain connectivity by keeping our customers connected, and as Joe articulated, passing on price increases to customers. At the same time, we've been very focused on how we continue to enhance our business model. So, from a supply chain standpoint, whether it's semiconductor chips or is resin or other inputs to what we manufacture. We've been very focused on how do we redesign the product and take out content, lower cost, how do we operate with our supply base more efficiently and more effectively to lower cost how do we operate with our customers from a supply chain standpoint as well to increase efficiency and take out cost. And then at the same time, when you look at inflation in around areas like labor, we continue to rotate where we do things, how do we increase our -- how do we move manufacturing, engineering, and other as well as how do we improve the productivity within the existing four walls so that we -- again, on an organic basis, we're driving down our cost of operating. So, it's really a two-pronged approach in terms of pushing incremental inflation onto our customers, while at the same time, trying to operate more efficiently, whether or not we're getting -- we're experiencing material inflation and other items. Dan Levy : Thank you, that was very helpful. Operator: We will take our next question from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mark Delaney : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned that Aptiv has been a little bit more conservative on its EV volume projections given the cost of those platforms. I'm hoping you can clarify, whether has there been a change at all in Aptiv's own outlook for EV volumes this year because some OEMs have certainly talked recently about seeing some slower EV growth, but perhaps some or all of that is being offset by upside that other OEMs may be realizing? Kevin Clark : No. Listen, our assumptions have always been lower than what I think some of the industry forecasts have. So, I'd say from a baseline standpoint, overall view on BEV penetration, high voltage penetration has been lower and has been for an extended period of time as we evaluate business cases for specific platforms or customers, our assumptions on volume tend to be on the more conservative side. And as I mentioned, as it relates to contracting and pricing, we have some levers that we include to provide us with some risk mitigation. So, nothing has changed in terms of our overall outlook. I would say the industry is probably coming closer to where our initial perspectives were as related to bet penetration. Having said that, although we're more conservative revenue growth in the second quarter on high-voltage solutions is close to 50%. So, -- and we're still expecting very significant growth for the balance of the year and into the out years. Joe Massaro : Yes, Mark, it's Joe. I mean we had talked about at Investor Day high-voltage being at least 30% grower per year for '23, '24, '25, and that view has not changed at all. So, I think that's -- that was reflective of sort of where we were on our estimates relative to the broader sort of forecasting community. Mark Delaney : That's very helpful context. Thank you. And my other question was just around software, and Wind River and some OEMs have continued to struggle with the understandable large challenge of software integration. You mentioned momentum with Wind River and I'm curious if you could elaborate a bit more on the types of engagements Wind River is seen with auto OEMs, and perhaps there's been a recent uptick to some of these challenges that the industry is facing that Wind River can help to address? Thanks. Kevin Clark : Yes. I'm not sure there's an uptick. I think the industry still wrestles with software. I think there are still major challenges. Wind River has announced a number of program wins with OEMs, I think today we're, we're actively engaged with, I don't know, 10 OEM to 12 OEMs as it relates to their underlying kind of software architecture and some of the needs that Wind River can provide a lot of momentum there. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, I would expect by the end of the year to have some additional amounts to make. So, those challenges present an opportunity for Wind River. And then when you think about the middleware, real-time operating system as it relates to Aptiv, whether it be in user experience or ADAS or other areas, certainly opportunities for Aptiv as well. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator: We will be taking our final question from Tom Narayan from RBC. Please go ahead.Tom Narayan : Hi, thank you for taking the question. Joe, maybe can you help us understand ASUX timing in 2023? I remember from Q1, I think there were some orders that may have been pushed out. Did those really come in, in Q2? Or are there kind of more to come there on H2? And I know there were I think there were some engineering credits that you expected later in the year. Just trying to understand how we should think about the ASUX business. Joe Massaro : Yes. On the -- on the engineering credit, that's a very normal flow that happens every year on ASUX. Last year, by way of example, it was about $40 million of credits in the back half of the year. I'm not saying it will be that amount this year, but that's an order of magnitude, call it, somewhere sort of $20 million to $40 million is sort of a good range to use on that. As it relates to -- you're right, as it relates to Q1, ASUX had a couple of launches that launch, but we're ramping slower than expected due to supply availability from other suppliers. As we talked about at the time, those programs really came back online in March, and have been hitting schedules since -- and that was in North America. I think ASUX North America's growth over the market was north of 20% in the second quarter. So, those are back what you saw now in North America, I referenced, we've got -- which is, again, nothing to do with supply chain, sort of getting back to sort of normal ebbs and flows of the business. We've got some -- on the SPS side, we've got some programs winding down. We've got a heavy launch calendar in the back half of the year. So, I think as you get to the end of the year, North America's growth over the market will look like the rest of the business, but you always get a little bit of lumpiness from time to time in some of those numbers. Tom Narayan : I don't know if you guys can answer this. But on the whole UAW situation, and this might be a question really for the OEMs, but -- have you guys noticed OEMs kind of building inventory ahead of it? Or maybe put another way, looking back at what happened in 2019 for you guys, is there anything you've learned from that experience that could help you prepare in the event something happens? Thanks. Kevin Clark : Yes. Listen, I think we direct you to our OEM customers. So, we don't have a UAW workforce in North America. So, from a direct employee standpoint, that's not something where we have exposure where we have exposure. I think we would say, having gone through it in 2019. There's some small operational lessons learned as it relates to kind of supply chain management, and inventory management. Things like that. But I think it's a question more appropriate for our OEM customers. Tom Narayan : Got it thank you. Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Kevin Clark, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Clark : Great. Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Have a great day. Take care. Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

This means the annual payment is 3.7% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Northern Trust Northern Trust's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much.Northern Trust has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Northern Trust's payout ratio of 54% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 41.3%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 41% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendNorthern Trust Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.20 total annually to $3.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.6% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Northern Trust May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Unfortunately, Northern Trust's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year.Our Thoughts On Northern Trust's DividendIn summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company. Is Northern Trust not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

View our latest analysis for Hologic How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hologic is:9.3% = US$484m ÷ US$5.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Hologic's Earnings Growth And 9.3% ROEAt first glance, Hologic's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 9.0%, we may spare it some thought. Particularly, the exceptional 39% net income growth seen by Hologic over the past five years is pretty remarkable. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Hologic's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 9.7%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for HOLX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Hologic Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Hologic doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Hologic certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Fortunately, the Zacks Rank can provide investors with a proven quantitative approach to picking stocks.The Zacks #1 Rank list highlights companies that are experiencing upward trending earnings revisions, which significantly boosts the stocks near-term performance.Because of the robust economic environment, slowing inflation, and normalizing interest rate policy, there is a strong likelihood that this bull market is just getting started. And while some investors think now is the time to book the gains on their recent wins, it may in fact be time to press on the accelerator.Three fresh additions to the Zacks #1 Ranks list that look extremely compelling are Astec Industries ASTE, Griffon GFF, and Netflix NFLX. Each of these stocks boasts strong earnings revisions and some solid buying momentum pushing them higher this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstec IndustriesAstec Industries a leading manufacturer and marketer of road building equipment. The company sells equipment used in each phase of road building, from quarrying and crushing the aggregate to applying the asphalt.Astec Industries also manufactures equipment and components unrelated to road construction, including equipment for the mining, quarrying, construction and demolition industries and port and rail yard operators among many other industries.Astec holds a dominant position in attractive niche markets in industries benefiting from long-term secular trends including population growth, urbanization, and aging infrastructure. It also boasts an industry-leading reputation for innovation, high-quality products, and superior customer service.ASTE has seen analysts revise earnings estimates nicely higher over the last couple of months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by 4.4% and are projected to climb 71.4% YoY to $0.48 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by 4.1% over the last two months and are expected to grow 128% YoY to $2.81 per share.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstec Industries has clearly begun to draw investors’ attention demonstrated by the stage one breakout. ASTE carved out a nearly 18-month base from which it broke out of and moved emphatically higher just last months. Now the stock looks to be forming a bull flag continuation pattern, where investors can trade the next move higher.Although it looks like it may need a few more days of sideways action, once ASTE trades above the $53.75 level it should initiate its next leg higher. Alternatively, if the price can’t hold above the $51.40 level, the setup is invalid, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.  TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAstec Industries is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 19.1x, which is below the market average of 21.2x, and below its 10-year median of 21.2x. ASTE also offers a dividend yield of 1% and has raised the payment by 3.7% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGriffon Griffon is a diversified management and holding company conducting business through wholly owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them, and manages their capital structures.GFF focuses on acquiring, owning, and operating businesses in a variety of industries, and intends to continue the growth of its existing segments and diversify further through investments and acquisitions.Griffon’s primary businesses are the AMES company, which is a manufacturer of non-powered lawn and garden tools founded in 1876. ClosetMaid, a North American manufacturer and distributor of wood and wire home storage and organization products. And Clopay Building Products, a manufacturer of residential and commercial sectional doors and is North America's largest manufacturer of residential garage doors.Although next quarter earnings estimates have seen some slight revisions lower, all the other timeframes have experienced upgrades. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 8.5%, and FY23 earnings estimates have been boosted by 4.8% over the last two months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last two years GFF has made it a priority to return huge amounts of cash to shareholders through dividends. The dividend payment has exploded higher from $0.32 per share in 2021 to $4.42 per share today.The dividend payment jumped so high because GFF management announced a $2 special dividend payment in late June 2023. After completing the sale of Telephonics, it was decided that the capital would be immediately returned to shareholders.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGriffon is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 10.1x, which is below the market average of 21.2x, and below its 10-year median valuation of 13.3x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetflixNetflix has gone through an extremely painful couple of years but has managed to come roaring back in 2023. During the bear market of 2022, NFLX stock drew down -77%, yet has managed to make back a majority of those loses so far this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike the stock price, earnings estimates have been moving considerably higher. Current quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by nearly 11% and are projected to grow 12.3% YoY to $3.48 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been revised higher by nearly 7% and are expected to climb 19.9% YoY to $11.93 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetflix is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 36.3x, which is below the industry average of 46x, and well below its five-year median of 60x. Although it is debatable based on more granular data, NFLX in my opinion is the king of streaming services. It boasts the largest userbase and has a path to 1 billion paying subscribers.It is hard to believe that in the depths of 2022, NFLX was trading at just 15x forward earnings, however even at this current valuation it remains rather appealing.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLooking for winning stocks? Checking the Zacks #1 Rank is always a fantastic place to begin your research process.  Now that we can confidently say that the bull market is back, it is time for investors to hone their investing knowledge and identify stocks to carry their portfolios higher. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amid all of the recent reports from Apple, Amazon, and others, let’s explore two highly-ranked technology stocks trading at attractive valuations that offer investors long-term growth opportunities. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 posted big declines in the middle of the week as Wall Street digested the Fitch downgrade of U.S. government debt and a ton of other news. Meanwhile, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have rebounded as investors price in the likelihood of higher rates for longer as the Fed attempts to bring inflation down to its 2% target amid a persistently strong economy.The July jobs report that dropped Friday morning showed the U.S. added 187K jobs last month vs. the 200K estimate and June’s 209K. Unemployment also slipped back down to 3.5%. Beyond of the jobs market, Wall Street is engrossed with earnings and reports from Apple and other market movers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped below their 21-day moving averages earlier this week. Despite the possibility of more near-term volatility and selling throughout earnings season, the bulls are attempting to remain firmly in control—trying to hold that 21-day line.Jabil (JBL) Jabil is a tech-focused manufacturing services giant that works with the likes of Apple (AAPL) and other leaders across consumer tech, health care, energy and beyond. The company’s global scope and highly diversified customer base helped JBL grow steadily over the years. Jabil posted 12% average revenue expansion between FY18 and FY22, including 14% sales growth in its fiscal 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe manufacturing solutions provider topped our Q3 FY23 estimates in mid-June and provided upbeat guidance that helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. JBL’s recent positivity is part of long-term upward earnings momentum for the stock. Zacks estimates call for JBL’s revenue to climb again in FY23 and FY24 to help boost its adjusted earnings by 11% and 9%, respectively.Story continuesJabil is part of Zacks Electronics - Manufacturing Services industry that ranks in the top 2% of over 250 Zacks industries. JBL’s 4% dividend payout ratio (0.3% yield) offers huge long-term upside, and five out of the six brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys.” On top of that, Jabil is poised to grow alongside the wider world of intricate and complex manufacturing for tech and beyond. Plus, JBL could be a long-term winner amid the onshoring/reshoring push in the U.S.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of JBL have climbed 360% during the last 10 years vs. the Zacks tech sector’s 260%, including a 285% run in the past five years. Jabil is up 60% YTD and trades around 5% below its recent records and solidly above its 50-day moving average. Despite its recent and long-term outperformance, Jabil trades at a 50% discount to the Zacks Tech sector at 12.7X forward 12-month earnings and 31% below its own decade-long highs.Netflix (NFLX)Netflix shares skyrocketed 160% off their 2022 lows as investors decided it was time to buy into the beaten-down tech giant as it started to act and trade more like an established industry leader and not a rapid expansion engine. Despite the comeback and its 45% YTD climb, NFLX still trades over 35% below its peaks. And it recently found support at its 50-day moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the valuation front, Netflix trades at a 60% discount to its 10-year median at 30.7X forward earnings—and nearly 95% below its highs. Netflix is now trading at levels it was at in 2010 and more closely in line with the wider Zacks Tech sector. In fact, Netflix is trading at a PEG ratio, which factors in its growth outlook, of 1.2 vs. Tech’s 2.0 and at a 36% discount to its own five-year median.Netflix was the streaming TV pioneer that helped permanently change the way people consume TV and movies. NFLX’s head start and growing content library has seen it maintain an edge over Disney, Apple, Amazon, and countless other streamers. NFLX beat our Q2 earnings and sales estimate on July 19 on the back of a nice user gain that saw it hit 238 million paid memberships, up 8% from the year-ago period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe natural slowdown in Netflix’s growth propelled it to roll out a lower-cost ad-based tier, set up paid sharing features, and explore new growth areas. NFLX’s recent upward EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with it projected to post 20% adjusted earnings growth in FY23 and 32% stronger earnings next year on 7% and 13% higher sales, respectively. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

76,f4b4fb2b-f931-3989-ba80-1db08cb1c9b9,NFLX,2023-08-05,Disney’s Gen Z princess joins the labor movement as Rachel Zegler says ‘fellas is it woke to wanna be fairly compensated’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-gen-z-princess-joins-181634718.html,1691172994,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Even Snow White has bills to pay. Acting the role of princess isn’t always like the fantasyland equipped with singing birds and somehow cute rats that Disney might have you believe. Even the seemingly picture-perfect gigs in Hollywood are a lot a lot like too many jobs these days: a lot of work and not enough pay. It’s hard to, as they say, whistle while you work if you’re getting paid pennies, or not getting paid anything for something that will be streamed instead of broadcast.Rachel Zegler, the star of Disney's upcoming live-action Snow White, recently unveiled as much, as she picketed with other striking writers and actors in a viral video. “If I’m gonna stand there 18 hours in a dress of an iconic Disney princess, I deserve to be paid for every hour that it’s streamed online,” Zegler said. She’s just one of the many stars who have touched on issues of fair pay this summer, increasingly doing so with the aid of the internet.The WGA and SAG-AFTRA unions have made historic waves, as they're both currently on strike in response to studios' refusal to meet their demands for A.I. regulations and better compensation, particularly with regard to streaming residuals. What streaming residuals, you ask? Exactly.The last time a joint strike hit Hollywood was decades ago, during the early 1960s, and its leaders ironically included Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston: two men who would become conservative political figures in the 1980s and ’90s as the labor movement entered a historic decline. But Reagan and Heston bequeathed to the industry its modern setup, where actors would be paid out huge sums for syndicated rebroadcasts. In the ’90s, as Heston assumed the presidency of the NRA, their labor agreement paid off in historic fashion for the casts of Seinfeld and Friends, who still get massive checks every year for their work being in ""reruns."" It has brought Jerry Seinfeld himself close to billionaire status, Cosmopolitan estimated earlier this year.Story continuesThat kind of deal isn't on offer from Netflix, though—or Disney+.No syndication in streamingThe generic actor’s struggle to live comfortably while they try to make it big is a well-trod cliché, such that it has long merited the stereotype of “starving artist.” But streaming has led to a greater fast for these creatives, as even notable names have felt the sting of paltry or nonexistent streaming residuals, and it’s an issue that’s been simmering for some time now.“They don’t pay actors like they used to, and with streamers, you no longer get residuals,” Sydney Sweeney, star of Euphoria, said to the Hollywood Reporter last summer. Adding that she needs brand deals to afford the cost of all the trappings of a star (like a team of publicists and lawyers), Sydney explained that acting alone no longer provides the same sense of financial security that breakout stars like her used to enjoy.It’s partly because we’re no longer in the age where broadcast TV dominates, and along with the elimination of kooky live studio laugh tracks, that means a slimmer paycheck for writers and actors. As Netflix rewrote the rules of television, putting every show at the viewer's fingertips to binge as much as they wanted, whenever they wanted, it soon started rewriting the rules of movies, too. It dovetailed with the decline of the cable TV industry amid the ""cord-cutting"" phenomenon to kick-start an era called the ""streaming wars,"" as every media firm raced to create its own streamer, losing billions of dollars in the process. But streamed shows weren't subject to the old syndication residuals that were collectively agreed to by Reagan, Heston, and company.One of the early crown jewels of streaming, Netflix's Orange is the New Black, helped bring the issue of (lack of) streaming residuals to the public’s attention. Kimiko Glenn, whose portrayal of Brook Soso in the series earned her multiple ensemble Screen Actors Guild Awards, explained that while she had earned acclaim from the role, that was about it. And acclaim doesn’t pay the rent. Her viral TikTok from 2020 showed as much, as the check for foreign residuals for over 10 years only amounted to $27. “So many of my friends who have nearly a million followers, who are doing billion-dollar franchises, don’t know how to make rent,” Glenn later told Michael Schulman of the New Yorker. Hollywood, a land often of smoke (Botox) and mirrors, has become uncharacteristically open, as writers and actors have spoken out on social media about the less exciting parts of their jobs.Mandy Moore, star of the recent suburban mom smash This Is Us, explained recently that despite how big a hit her show was, she received residual checks worth pennies—specifically, one penny.Iger hints TV is a bad business for DisneyBob Iger, at the helm of Disney once again, has found himself in the unfamiliar role of villain after a legendary run as CEO last decade. His comments regarding what he deemed to be unrealistic expectations regarding writers’ pay earned swift backlash, but he's looking at the entertainment landscape totally differently now. In a wide-ranging interview recently, he hinted at dropping TV ventures saying “they might not be core to Disney.” And his ESPN asset, once a cash cow in the cable space, is also being actively reconsidered within the portfolio.Issues of low pay and a hiking cost of living have been brewing across every sector, not just in La-La Land. Many workers find themselves taking on extra jobs simply to make ends meet. Younger generations feel the sting especially keenly, as they make less in their early careers and have been set back by recessions and student loans. If Gen Z and millennials have become the spokespeople for better pay, it’s simply because their money doesn’t seem to go as far, leading to struggles in wealth building, home ownership, and financial independence.It seems as if our new Gen Z princess has (like the rest of her generation) had enough. As she posted on social media, apparently in response to some backlash over her comments, “fellas is it woke to wanna be fairly compensated,” adding “this barbie is still on strike and still a proud SAG-AFTRA member.”Zegler did not respond to Fortune's request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Discovery’s streaming service,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/not-just-disney-losing-customers-181043028.html,1691172643,STORY,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[Disney CEO Bob Iger hemorrhaged 4 million streaming subscribers in its fiscal second quarter after his company’s India-based Hotstar video platform lost the rights to Indian Premier League cricket matches.Now its David Zaslav’s turn to bleed business after his heavily criticized rebrand of Max, which involved dumping one of the most recognizable names in entertainment—HBO—when merging the respective platforms of Warner Bros. and Discovery in May.The bane of any streaming service is churn: subscribers signing up one month to take advantage of a special offer before jettisoning their membership shortly afterwards, often in favor of a rival platform. Now Warner Bros. Discovery reported on Thursday that some 1.8 million paying customers set sail for other shores in the second quarter over the preceding three months, and it’s a good bet some of those who left may have even wound up at Comcast’s rival platform Peacock.“We said we were going to build a strong, sustainable direct-to-consumer strategy focused on profitable growth as opposed to chasing subs at any cost,” Zaslav told investors.The problem for Zaslav, the most overpaid CEO in America last year according to one study, is that the bulk of those subscribers lost—roughly 1.3 million—were the more lucrative U.S. customers who generated on average $11.09 in revenue per user during the quarter versus just $3.65 for its international subscribers.“While we have seen some expected subscriber disruption, we have experienced lower-than-expected churn throughout this process,” he offered.The problem all media giants face now is the immensely profitable business model of linear broadcasting is broken because an increasing number of cable subscribers are cutting the cord so they can view content on demand rather than when a network exec decides on their behalf.Over time, the economics of the business will deteriorate, which is why Iger is considering a yard sale—possibly selling stakes in ESPN and ABC—to maximize the value while he still can.Story continuesDisney’s moment of truth next weekOffering the convenience of at-home or on-the-go streaming has been the industry’s natural answer to the shift in consumer habits. And, at least in theory, selling subscriptions comes with the added benefit of recurring revenue that is supposedly stable and predictable in an age of volatility, but in practice the economics aren’t holding up.Yet no one apart from Netflix—the first to market—has been able to escape the rivers of red ink.“We estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, versus Netflix’s $5 [billion] to $6 billion annual operating profit,” Netflix said in October about the competition.At least Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming division managed to nearly break even with a negligible $3 million, a half billion-dollar improvement over the previous year’s period. But the company still predicts that only its U.S. streaming business, which accounts for little more than half its streaming customers, will be profitable this year.Now streaming execs have raised the white flag in capitulation, with Disney leading the retreat.After Disney incurred over $10 billion in cumulative streaming losses since launching Disney+ in 2019, the company pledged last August to introduce a new lower-price streaming tier supported by ads. Then, in February, it unveiled $3 billion in production budget cuts.Finally Disney even announced an impairment charge of up to $1.8 billion to reflect the cost of removing shows from its streaming platform that increase the cost of its cloud hosting bills, including some of its own original programming.Investors will find out just how Disney+ is faring when the company reports fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 9. But executives already warned its streaming business will likely see operating losses widen by around $100 million over the previous quarter to around $750 million owing to a shift in the timing of marketing expenses.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Earnings rose 8% year over year due to higher revenues, which were offset by higher operating costs.Total revenues of $6.99 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion. Total revenues rose 6% year over year driven by higher product sales.Total product revenues increased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.68 billion (U.S.: $4.74 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.95 billion). Higher volumes were offset by lower selling prices of several drugs. Volumes rose 11% in the quarter, offset by a 2% lower net selling price. Foreign exchange movement hurt sales by 1% in the quarter.Other revenues were $303 million in the quarter, down 3.2% year over year.Performance of Key DrugsGeneral MedicineProlia revenues came in at $1.03 billion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven by volume growth. Prolia sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $974 million as well as our model estimate of $962.6 million.Evenity recorded sales of $281 million in the quarter, up 47% year over year, driven by strong volume growth both in and outside the United States. Evenity sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $262 million as well as our model estimate of $242.5 million.Repatha generated revenues of $424 million, up 30% year over year, as higher volume was partially offset by lower prices.

Xgeva sales were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Kyprolis recorded sales of $346 million, up 9% year over year, driven by volume growth, which was partially offset by a lower net selling price. Increased new patient share in the second-line setting pushed up volumes in the quarter.Story continuesVectibix revenues came in at $248 million, up 20% year over year, driven by volume growth. Nplate sales rose 9% to $310 million, driven by volume growth. Blincyto sales increased 48% from the year-ago period to $206 million.Amgen’s newly approved drug, Lumakras/ Lumykras recorded sales of $77 million in the quarter compared with $74 million in the previous quarter.

Improved payer coverage led to some better volume growth in the second quarter.Newly approved asthma drug, Tezspire (tezepelumab) recorded sales of $133 million in the quarter, up 39% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Tezspire volumes benefited from the launch of a self-administered, pre-filled, single-use pen formulation of the drug in the first quarter. which improves patient convenience and accessibility and also provides more flexibility in treatment options.Amgen has a partnership with AstraZeneca AZN for Tezspire. Amgen and AstraZeneca share costs and profits equally after AstraZeneca’s payment of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen.

Amgen launched Amjevita in the United States at a 55% lower list price than the current price set by AbbVie for Humira in February. Amgen already markets a biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira, Amgevita, in the United States.Also, several more biosimilar versions of AbbVie’s Humira were launched in July, which can hurt Amjevita sales going forward.New drug Tavneos generated $30 million in sales in the second quarter compared with $23 million in the previous quarter. The drug’s 30% sequential growth was driven by new patient volume growth. Tavneos, approved for the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious systemic autoimmune disease, was added to Amgen’s portfolio with the 2022 acquisition of ChemoCentryx.Established ProductsTotal sales of established products, which include Epogen, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Neulasta, decreased 17% year over year in the second quarter.Operating Margins DeclineAdjusted operating margin declined 0.5 percentage points to 52.6% in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to $3.47 billion due to higher cost of goods sold and R&amp;D costs.R&amp;D expenses rose 7% year over year to $1.09 billion due to higher investments behind late-stage pipeline candidates. SG&amp;A spending declined 6% to $1.24 billion due to lower marketing costs.2023 Guidance RaisedAmgen slightly raised its previously issued revenue and earnings guidance for 2023.Revenues are expected in the range of $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion, up from the previous expectation of $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $26.96 billion.Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of $17.80 to $18.80, up from the prior expectations of $17.60 to $18.70 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $17.54 per share.However, third-quarter revenues and adjusted earnings are expected to be lower than the second quarter.Adjusted R&amp;D costs are expected to increase 5% year over year from the 2022 level versus the prior expectation of 3% to 4%. S&amp;A spending is expected to decrease slightly year over year, driven by productivity improvements (maintained). Total operating expenses are expected to increase around 3% versus the prior expectation of 1% versus the 2022 level. Amgen expects operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% in 2023.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% (previously 18.0%-19.0%), while capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $925 million. The company expects to buy back shares worth not more than $500 million in 2023.The 2023 guidance excludes any contribution from the pending acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.In December 2022, Amgen announced a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $116.5 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. In May, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to halt the buyout deal.Per the FTC, if the acquisition is allowed to go through, a large-cap giant like Amgen could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's key products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout). Per the agency, the drugs currently face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients. Along with the second-quarter earnings release, Amgen said it expects the acquisition to be closed in December 2023.Pipeline UpdateAlong with the earnings release, Amgen announced positive data from a potentially registrational phase II study on its pipeline candidate tarlatamab in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer who had failed two or more prior lines of treatment. Data from the DeLLphi-301 study showed that treatment with tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule, led to a better objective response rate, the study’s primary endpoint, than that seen in earlier phase I study. Responses were durable and longer than that seen with standard-of-care chemotherapy. Amgen plans to discuss this data with the FDA to seek approval of the drug.Our TakeAmgen’s second-quarter results were strong as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. The company witnessed robust volume growth across all its three therapeutic areas, general medicine, inflammation and hematology-oncology portfolios. Sales of most key drugs like Prolia, Repatha, Evenity and Otezla topped expectations. Two of its newest medicines, Tezspire and Tavneos, once again achieved sequential growth in the quarter. It raised its earnings and sales guidance for the year as prescription trends and demand for its products are improving.The stock was up 1.3% in after-hours trading. Amgen’s stock has declined 12.1% so far this year compared with a decline of 12.9% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn 2023, Amgen expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel and lower COVID-19 antibody revenues. Amgen also expects a declining net selling price in 2023. The addition of Horizon Therapeutics, if successfully closed, will enhance Amgen’s growth prospects.Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity.Amgen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The sector primarily comprises pharma/biotech and medical device companies.Most of the large drug and biotech companies have already announced their second-quarter results. Most companies beat estimates for earnings and sales. A majority of these drugmakers also raised their guidance for 2023. As expected, COVID-19 drug sales during the quarter declined significantly due to lower demand. Though pharma giants like AstraZeneca, Merck and Pfizer reported a steep decline in revenues from their COVID-19 products, sales of their non-COVID products registered a healthy year-over-year growth. In fact, AstraZeneca and Merck reported better-than-expected Q2 results — beating earnings and sales estimates — despite generating nearly negligible sales from their COVID-19 products.The Earnings Trends report indicates that as of Aug 2, 56.9% of the companies in the Medical sector — representing 69.1% of the sector’s market capitalization — reported quarterly earnings. About 84.8% of participants beat estimates on both earnings and revenues. While earnings declined 33.8% year over year, revenues rose 4.5% from the year-ago period’s levels. Overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline by 31.1%. Sales are expected to increase by 4.3%, each from the year-ago quarter’s respective reported figures.Zeroing in on WinnersHere we have highlighted four biotech companies — Axsome Therapeutics AXSM, Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings ARCT, Emergent BioSolutions EBS and Novavax NVAX — that are expected to deliver a beat in their upcoming quarterly results.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining the stocks with the best chance to deliver an earnings surprise.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.6 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Dominion Energy shares have lost about 17.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.3%.What's Next for Dominion Energy?While Dominion Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Dominion Energy: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Masco investors that purchase the stock on or after the 10th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.28 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.14 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Masco has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current stock price of $59.38. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Masco can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Masco Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Masco paying out a modest 32% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Masco generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 31% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Masco's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Masco has grown its earnings rapidly, up 22% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Masco has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayHas Masco got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Masco has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - Masco has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

99,58474f72-649c-3890-b4ef-6125af3767c2,TSN,2023-08-05,The Returns On Capital At Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) Don't Inspire Confidence,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-tyson-foods-nyse-124700532.html,1691153220,STORY,['TSN'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Tyson Foods:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$37b - US$5.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Tyson Foods has an ROCE of 7.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Food industry average of 9.8%. Check out our latest analysis for Tyson Foods roceIn the above chart we have measured Tyson Foods' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Tyson Foods.What Can We Tell From Tyson Foods' ROCE Trend?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Tyson Foods, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 13%, but since then they've fallen to 7.4%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Tyson Foods is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And with the stock having returned a mere 6.4% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.One more thing to note, we've identified   3 warning signs  with Tyson Foods and understanding them should be part of your investment process.While Tyson Foods isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Thanks for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3, we delivered results consistent with our guidance with non-GAAP earnings of $1.87 per share, above the midpoint of our guidance. We recorded fiscal Q3 non-GAAP revenues of $8.4 billion, including $7.2 billion from our chipset business and $1.2 billion from our licensing business. This quarter also marked our 11th straight quarter of year-over-year double-digit percentage growth in QCT Automotive revenues. We are pleased with our technology, product and design win execution, positioning us well for continued leadership enhancements and future growth and diversification in automotive and IoT. I will now share some highlights from across the business.Story continuesOur Snapdragon Series mobile platforms continue to set the benchmark for premium tier mobile experiences. Smartphones powered by our Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 represent the top devices according to Antutu benchmarks in Android Authority. We are also pleased that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy will again power Samsung's newest flagship device lineup globally. The Galaxy Z Flip, Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Galaxy Tab S9 series. Our fastest Snapdragon ever for Samsung defines a new standard in smartphone computing capabilities AI experiences, desk top-level gaming features, professional-grade photography, enhanced mobile productivity and more. This launch underscores Qualcomm and Samsung's mutual commitment to delivering premium consumer experiences for flagship Galaxy devices.We are extremely proud of our successful partnership with Samsung Mobile. We are also pleased to extend Snapdragon experiences to mass market 5G smartphones. The redesigned Snapdragon for Gen 2 mobile platform will bring premium experiences at reduced prices to help drive 4G to 5G migration, especially in new 5G deployments worldwide. We're looking forward to device announcements in the second half of 2023. In automotive, we hosted our first Automotive Summit in Suzhou, China, with more than 1,000 automotive OEMs, Tier 1s, ecosystem partners, media, analysts and government officials in attendance. The broad participation at the event demonstrates Qualcomm's strong position as a technology partner to the growing automotive ecosystem worldwide, especially EVs as well as Snapdragon digital chassis technology and product leadership.We also won more than 10 new designs with leading automakers across the globe for next-generation digital cockpit and telematics systems. In Consumer IoT, the recently announced Meta Quest 3 is the first virtual and mixed reality headset to be powered by a next-generation Snapdragon XR platform developed in collaboration with Meta -- the Quest 3 features 2x the graphical performance, higher resolution and a slimmer, more comfortable form factor than the Quest 2. We're also helping to drive the growing ecosystem of VR and MR developers in China. Oppo recently announced their Oppo MR Glass Developer Edition, powered by Snapdragon XR2. And in compute, our next-generation PC platform with integrated custom Orion CPUs in a significantly upgraded AI engine remains on track for commercial readiness.We look forward to sharing more information at our Snapdragon Summit in October. In networking IoT, we continue to gain momentum with WiFi 7 customer design wins. As an example, TP Link expanded its retail small and media business lines by launching 5 new routers spanning indoor and outdoor deployment scenarios, all based on Qualcomm networking Pro WiFi 7 platforms. Lastly, we're very pleased to share that we have begun shipping our fixed wireless access solutions in support of Reliance deals upcoming 5G FWA service in India. In industrial IoT, we launched a video collaboration platform suite, which provides OEMs choice and flexibility for the design and deployment of immersive video conference devices across conference rooms, health care settings and at home video calling with friends and family, enabling Windows, Android and Linux on our platforms offers the ability to customize and deploy videoconferencing products across diverse environments.Additionally, our platforms offer industry-leading AI-based noise suppression and dynamic framing. We also launched the QCS 8550 and QCS 4490, our first software-defined IoT solutions at Hannover Messe. These solutions enable next-gen smart cameras, drones, robotics, cloud gaming, industrial handhelds, panels point-of-sale devices and more. Lastly, together with Arrow Electronics, we announced a strategic collaboration to accelerate edge and AI adoption to the formation of Edge Labs, an aero center of excellence designed to help customers alleviate IoT development challenges while increasing adoption of edge AI across a variety we have an update on our progress in Generative AI since the last call. We're very pleased and encouraged by the rapid acceleration of Gen AI at the edge.This presents a significant opportunity for Qualcomm across our end markets. Use cases at the edge are evolving differently than the cloud given the inherent context, immediacy, privacy, security, application reliability and personalization capabilities available on device. For example, in handsets, models such as Stable Diffusion and Control Net or changing user experiences for content creation and photography. Large language models embedded in the user interface can also enable enhanced virtual assistance. In personal computing, real-time copilots can bring significant enhancements to productivity and creativity, the benefits of which are well understood and very compelling for enterprises across industries. We believe the automotive industry will use some of the most advanced edge AI capabilities from large language models for personalized and curated content and services driver and occupant monitoring and AI virtual assistance to contextual search.ADAS and autonomy applications can be enhanced by the fusion of data from cameras and other sensors for combined real word perception, drive path prediction and more. We're helping enable this capabilities and expect Gen AI use cases to extend to XR, edge networking and industrial IoT. Within the quarter, we expanded our collaborations across the ecosystem, and we are engaged with multiple hyperscalers, OEMs and ISVs. Notably, we recently announced a collaboration with Meta on Llama 2-based AI implementations on flagship smartphones and PCs that will enable developers to create new and exciting Gen AI applications using the AI capabilities of Snapdragon platforms beginning in 2024. Together with Meta, we're working to optimize the execution of Meta's Llama 2 large language models directly on device.We also announced a focused collaboration with Microsoft to scale AI capabilities and bring best-in-class AI experience to users across consumer, enterprise and industrial devices. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference, our own device, Stable Diffusion, was showcased on a Windows on Snapdragon power laptop. We're also working with them to enable a host of productivity-based applications with multiple large models running on the device. As part of this collaboration, our AI engine direct SDK is now available to Windows developers to easily accelerate their AI apps on Snapdragon compute platforms. This marks a significant milestone. In summary, we are uniquely positioned to help shape and capitalize on the upcoming on-device Gen AI opportunity.Our AI technology is highly differentiated with best-in-class high-performance, low-power heterogeneous computing across our CPU, GPU and NPU. And a multibillion parameter Gen AI models run pervasively and continuously on device, we believe our NPUs unparalleled AI processing performance and power efficiency will become a requirement. We look forward to sharing more about our Gen AI capable products at Snapdragon Summit in October. Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to provide an update on how we are managing our business in the current macroeconomic environment. We remain focused on executing our strategy and prioritizing capital and resource allocation on our future growth and diversification opportunities. Simultaneously, we are focused on long-term operating margin targets, all while maintaining technology leadership across wireless connectivity, high performance, low power processing and artificial intelligence.To that end, we're taking a conservative view of the market, and we'll be proactively taking additional cost actions to ensure Qualcomm is well positioned to deliver maximum value for stockholders in an uncertain environment. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.See also 15 Most Consumed Meats in the World and 30 Drunkest Cities in AmericaAkash Palkhiwala : Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our third fiscal quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.4 billion and EPS of $1.87, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. QTL recorded revenues of $1.2 billion and EBT margin of 66% and reflecting slightly lower-than-expected global devices. QCT revenues of $7.2 billion and EBIT margin of 24% were consistent with the midpoint of our guidance. Handset revenues of $5.3 billion reflected the industry landscape we have previously outlined. IoT revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.5 billion, driven by consumer and industrial IoT customers. We saw continued momentum in automotive for our Snapdragon digital chassis products with revenues of $434 million, a growth of 13% year-over-year.Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $2.2 billion. We have successfully executed on our fiscal '23 cost actions and are on track to exceed our commitment of a 5% reduction relative to fiscal '22 exit rate. During the quarter, the sale of Veoneer's active safety business to Magna was completed for net cash proceeds of $1.5 billion. Before turning to the fourth fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units and channel inventory. We continue to estimate that calendar 23 handset units will be down at least a high single-digit percentage relative to calendar '22, reflecting the macro environment and a slower recovery in China. This forecast contemplates growth in handset units going into the holiday season.In IoT, channel inventory remains elevated due to weaker demand driven by the broader macroeconomic conditions. Since it remains difficult to predict the timing of a sustained recovery and customers remain cautious with purchases, we continue to operate under the assumption that inventory drawdown dynamics will be a factor through the end of the calendar year. Turning to guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80 to $2. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and EBT margins of 64% to 68%, driven by a slight sequential increase in global handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $6.9 billion to $7.5 billion and EBT margins of 24% to 26%.This forecast is consistent with our prior guidance of muted seasonality in QCT revenues primarily due to the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer. On a sequential basis, we are forecasting Android handset revenues to be roughly flat with mid-single-digit decline in IoT and low double-digit growth in automotive. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat relative to the third quarter. As we approach fiscal '24, our revenue growth will largely depend on macroeconomic environment, global handset units and China recovery. In the first fiscal quarter, we expect 2 drivers of sequential revenue growth. QTL seasonality and handset launch by a modem-only customer. In addition, we expect a sequential decline in IoT and automotive revenues, consistent with the seasonal trend we've seen in the last couple of years.As you will recall, we had previously communicated we would evaluate additional cost actions as the environment continues to evolve. Until we see sustained signs of improving fundamentals, our operating framework does not assume an immediate recovery. Given our commitment to operating discipline, we will proactively implement additional cost actions in the first half of fiscal '24. This will be incremental to the reductions we have successfully completed in fiscal '23. Despite these actions, we will preserve investments in our strategic priorities and position ourselves to emerge stronger as the recovery from the broader industry begins to take hold. In closing, we remain focused on executing on our vision to bring connectivity, high-performance, low-power computing and on-device generative AI to the edge.Our guiding principles remain the same. -- prioritize technology leadership, accelerate diversification and drive earnings growth to create value for our stockholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan : Thank you, Akash.

For the second quarter of 2023, Aristotle Capital’s Value Equity Composite posted a total return of 4.56% gross of fees (4.51% net of fees), outperforming the 4.07% return of the Russell 1000 Value Index and underperforming the 8.74% return of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Spare some time to check the fund’s top 5 holdings to know more about their top bets for 2023.In its Q2 2023 investor letter, Aristotle Value Equity mentioned QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1985, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a San Diego, California-based multinational corporation with a $131.0 billion market capitalization. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) delivered a 5.48% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -23.21%. The stock closed at $129.27 per share on August 02, 2023.Here is what Aristotle Value Equity has to say about QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""Qualcomm, a leading wireless communications technology company, was one of the largest detractors for the period. Weaker demand for handsets, elevated channel inventory and an underwhelming Chinese economic recovery resulted in a more difficult‐than‐expected short‐term outlook. Qualcomm executives are navigating the short‐term challenges by actively managing operating expenses. In recent years, despite threats of large clients developing in‐house chips (e.g., Apple and Samsung), Qualcomm has been able to retain its high market share forged by a history of high spending in R&amp;D and what we consider to be technological superiority. Longer term, we believe Qualcomm will continue to benefit from 5G penetration, as well as from the execution of its diversification strategy, asInternet of Things and Automotive remain attractive end markets. As the world continues on the path toward a proliferation of connectivity between varying devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, wearable technology, Wi‐Fi access points, factory automation and infotainment systems in autos), we are convinced the company is in a strong position to continue to win market share in both existing and new end markets, and to continue to return FREE cash flow to shareholders.""Story continues15 Best Coding Games to Learn Programming for BeginnersCopyright: gmast3r / 123RF Stock PhotoOur calculations show that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was not able to secure a spot on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Our earnings release, SEC filings, and the replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.expediagroup.com and with that, let me turn the call over to Peter. Peter Kern: Thanks, Harshit, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Our travel demands remain robust, and we are pleased to see our continued execution result in solid performance for the second quarter. As gratifying as those results are, I am even more excited with the progress on our platform transformation journey, having just launched one key in the U.S., and continuing to be on schedule of our verbal migration. We are particularly pleased that we were able to meet our second quarter financial goals while electing to move some marketing spend from Q2 to Q3, where we believe it can be better spent in support of the launch of one key and our accelerated growth in the back half of the year. Industry trends have remained broadly consistent with the first quarter. And North America and Europe has remained stable with stronger growth in APAC and Latin America. Travelers worldwide continue to favor shorter stays in urban locations versus longer trips in sun and ski destinations. As far as pricing, both hotel and vacation rental ADRs are holding up year-over-year, while international cross-border airfares are stable. U.S. domestic airfares have seen some declines as capacity increases. Rental car rates continue to decline as inventories normalized from compressed levels last year, resulting in more attractive prices for consumers and more transactions. Overall the data continues to show that travel remains a top priority for consumers. As I explained before, our B2C strategy is to build products, features, and customer propositions that attract and help us retain valuable customers, and to move those customers into loyalty membership and app usage to amplify their value. These travelers drive higher profits per transaction and higher repeat rates, ultimately leading to higher lifetime value. In addition, as these customers have a higher propensity to come to us through direct channels, this helps us drive future leverage in sales and marketing. As a combination of all these factors, these travelers have a much higher return on investment and ultimately drive more profitable and faster growth as they stack up over time. As we continue to move from a purely transaction, room-night-focused world to one in which we focus on customers and lifetime value, we have been able to build a bigger, more valuable base of these high ROI travelers. Our focus on acquiring and retaining loyalty members and app users to drive this strategy continues to show good results. This quarter active loyalty members continue to hit new highs and were up 15% year-over-year in our core brands, and the percentage of bookings coming through our apps was up 300 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter. We know that members with the app have the best economics, which is why we have been so focused on growing this segment of customers. In our Expedia brand in the U.S., I am pleased to say that we have seen this cohort of customers increase roughly 135% versus 2019. As we roll out our strategy across all our brands and all our markets, there remains a significant opportunity to accelerate further. A couple of weeks ago, we took another major step forward with the launch of One Key in the U.S. This is the most flexible travel rewards program in the industry, with our core brands unified under one loyalty program offering our customers the ability to earn and use One Key Cash, a simple common currency, across our vast breadth of flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, cruises, and activities. In addition to the breadth of this program, this marks the first time any major vacation rental marketplace will have loyalty, which is a significant differentiator against our competition. It's early days, but as we have seen historically, our loyalty members are much more productive, and with this now best-in-class program spanning our biggest brands, we expect to drive many more customers into the program and substantially increase our base of loyal travelers. Overall, our B2C business is finally nearing the end of its major changes, and piece by piece getting the benefit of new capabilities and greater agility that comes from a unified stack. With One Key out the door, our last major tech lift is the verbal migration to our main platform. We have already moved 100% of our verbal U.S. web traffic to the platform and our on-track to complete the migration during the fourth quarter. As we've explained before, we expect some modest headwinds to conversion as we transition, but ultimately the payoff is well worth it with better conversion, increased feature velocity, and ultimately better performance from verbal overall. Our single-tech strategy is designed to give all of our brands the benefit of our entire suite of product features, including our latest advancements in AI and machine learning, to personalize and enhance the customer experience. On the topic of AI, earlier this year, we launched conversational trip planning, powered by ChatGPT and the Expedia iOS app. And last month, we launched it on the Expedia Android app. We have been learning from consumer interactions and are adding a number of new features to help consumers on their journey of discovery. Travelers can now start a new conversation by choosing from suggested prompts, and soon they will be able to return to a conversation at any time and even respond throughout a conversation by simply choosing a suggested response, all of which is designed to bring them one step closer to booking their desired trip. Along the growth and progress we've seen with our brands, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our B2B business, which grew revenue 32% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our B2B business has greater exposure outside the U.S. and has benefited by continued opening of markets around the world. The engine for our B2B business is fueled by the same technology, supply, and service that serve our own brands. And as we have advanced in all areas over the last several years, this has only added to the velocity of our B2B business. We believe we have the most successful and differentiated B business in the travel world with a large addressable segment still available to penetrate further. And our wins in the marketplace continue to demonstrate that point. In the second quarter, we announced a new partnership with MasterCard, where our tech will power MasterCard's global network of issuers so that their customers can spend their loyalty points on great travel experiences. And in another huge development for this segment, we've teamed up with Wal-Mart, where we are now powering their first-ever travel benefit for Wal-Mart Plus members through our white-label template solution. We also continue to expand our tech delivery to our existing partners, not only through our core TravelOS products, but through our expanding offering of solutions. After recently commercializing our fraud prevention capability, I am happy to announce that our Revenue Performance API is now in pilot with one of the largest hotel management companies. As our tech continues to advance, driven by our industry-leading AI capabilities and the acceleration of our single-and-platform strategy, there is much more opportunity to gain [lot of share] with our existing partners and to scale further with new partners. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum we now have in our accelerating product improvements as we move towards the second half of '23 and beyond. Over the last few years, we have taken on many difficult challenges in order to transform not only our tech, but our entire strategy. As we begin to emerge from this period of massive change, it is clear that we are building the best offerings for travelers, a better marketplace for our partners, and overall a better company. It is great to see so much finally come into fruition, and our entire organization is excited about the future. And with that, let me hand it over to Julie. Julie Whalen: Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter results with record revenue and EBITDA demonstrate that our strategic initiatives are working and that we have a significant opportunity for long-term growth and profitability. And it is this ongoing strength in the business that enabled us to deliver another quarter of accelerated levels of share repurchases, resulting in approximately $1.2 billion repurchased year-to-date, our largest buyback to date. Before I jump into more of the details, I wanted to remind you that going forward, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. It is also important to note that our second quarter 2023 growth rates, as compared to 2022, were impacted by FX headwinds of approximately 40 basis points to gross bookings, 170 basis points to revenue, and 530 basis points to EBITDA. We also saw an approximate 80 basis point headwind to the EBITDA margin. Now, as far as our performance this quarter, let's begin with our gross booking trends. Global gross bookings of $27.3 billion were up 5% versus last year, and in line with our mid-single-digit top-line guide. Growth was driven by lodging gross bookings, which were up 7%, and were the highest second quarter on record. The strength continues to be driven by our hotel business, which achieved record gross bookings primarily from strength in our B2B business, as well as in brand Expedia, which saw a 15% increase year-over-year. This was partially offset by our Vrbo business, which was impacted by the shift in consumer demand toward urban markets and shorter lengths of stays, as well as the impact from Vrbo's tech platform migration that we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call. However, given the size and strong growth of our hotel business, we were pleased that we were able to deliver record lodging bookings in total. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&amp;L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 6% versus last year, in line with our mid-single-digit top-line guide, and was the highest second quarter on record. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strength across our lodging business, which grew 12%. This was partially offset by softness we have been seeing in insurance and car, two categories that have been impacted by some industry-wide changes post-pandemic. For insurance, we are seeing lower attach rates as consumers appetite for insurance normalizes. And for car, we are continuing to see rates decline as supply has increased. Total revenue margin increased 10 basis points to approximately 12.3%, versus last year primarily due to an increased mix shift to lodging revenue, which has higher revenue margins. Cost of sales was $403 million for the quarter, which is lower than last year by $13 million, or 3%, with approximately 110 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus the second quarter of 2022, driven by ongoing efficiencies across our customer support and other operations. Our customer support operations continue to benefit from the various automation initiatives we have implemented over the past couple of years, and we will continue to find more efficiencies in such areas as the cloud and license and maintenance costs when we finalize our migration to one platform and eliminate redundant systems accordingly. Direct sales and marketing expense in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, which was up 2% versus the second quarter of 2022. The primary driver of this year-over-year increase was related to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support its strong growth of over 32%. As we've noted in the past, commissions paid to our B2B partners fall into our direct sales and marketing line, and overall are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business. Whereas they are generally paid on a state basis and to a contractually agreed upon percentage, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. This increase in B2B direct marketing costs was mostly offset by marketing efficiencies in our B2C business this quarter, and resulted in marketing leverage as a percentage of gross bookings as compared to the second quarter of 2022. These B2C marketing efficiencies resulted from the benefits we are seeing from our continued investments in loyalty and app members, as well as our decision to move some of our planned spend from the second quarter to the third quarter to tie it more closely with the one key launch and to support our accelerated growth in the back half. While marketing will fluctuate quarter to quarter, we were pleased to see this marketing leverage. Overhead expenses were $627 million, an increase of $77 million versus last year, or 14%. While we remain disciplined on our overall cost structure, as we have said, over the past year we have continued to invest in talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives, and we are pleased we were able to more readily fill these positions given the surplus of top tier tech talent in the market. We also saw higher salary expense associated with our annual compensation increases this year, which went into effect during the second quarter, and was the primary driver of the overhead increase from the first quarter. As we finish our technology work in the coming quarters and look to redeploy resources and to deprecate systems next year, we expect to realize cost efficiencies going forward. Despite this overhead pressure, we were pleased to see that with another quarter of strong revenue and overall expense disciplines, including our decision to shift some marketing spend, we delivered record second quarter EBITDA of $747 million, which was up 15% with an EBITDA margin of 22.2%, expanding approximately 190 basis points versus the second quarter of 2022. Our free cash flow remains strong at $3.8 billion year-to-date. The year-to-year decline is primarily associated with changes in working capital from the timing of payments. Last year, as the business emerged from Omicron, we saw meaningful increases in some of the working capital drivers like payables, which has since normalized this year. We remain pleased with an ongoing robust cash flow levels, and we expect them to remain strong on the year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $8.8 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $6.3 billion, and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with ample access to cash to operate the business. From a debt perspective, our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion, but with our expanding EBITDA, our gross leverage ratio has come down from the first quarter to 2.6 times. We have started to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio two times, and expect to make continued progress in the coming quarters through EBITDA growth and potentially some debt repayments. As far as capital allocation, given our strong free cash flow levels and a stock price that we believe remains undervalued, we have been buying back our stock on an accelerated basis to maximize our return of capital shareholders. As a result, we bought back approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date, or nearly 12 million shares, our largest level of repurchases to date. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued and does not reflect our confidence in the expected long-term performance of the business. Therefore, considering our ongoing strong liquidity and free cash flow, we expect to continue buying back our stock opportunistically throughout the remainder of 2023. Looking ahead, we are reiterating our full-year outlook of double-digit top-line growth with margin expansion. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect year-to-year gross bookings growth to accelerate to high single digits. This acceleration is driven by Brand Expedia and Hcom, partially offset by Vrbo, which continues to face short-term headwinds from its migration. While we expect revenue growth to be lower than gross bookings growth, driven by the prior quarters reduced Vrbo bookings converting to stays, and therefore revenue in the third quarter, which is historically our highest revenue quarter for Vrbo, we expect revenue growth to see modest sequential acceleration. We expect EBITDA margins to stay relatively in line with last year. While we expect to see continued cost of sales leverage, as previously mentioned, we will be investing in marketing to support the One Key launch and to set us up for a strong back half. Overall, we expect fourth quarter will see a more meaningful acceleration in both top line and bottom line growth as Vrbo finishes its migration, the One Key impact starts to kick in, and the growing base of app members drives more production, all of which gives us confidence to reiterate our full year outlook. In closing, we finish the front half of 2023 on a strong note with record second quarter revenue and EBITDA. We are pleased to see the continued momentum, even while we continue to transform the business and navigate associated headwinds. Our accelerating product improvements give us confidence that we are on the right path and that there is a huge opportunity in front of us to drive long-term profitable growth and to maximize shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. See also 10 Best Mutual Fund Managers of 2022 and 10 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Two if I could. In terms of forward booking trends, I understood on the commentary broadly about the summer, but the industries obviously had some tailwinds from elements of longer booking dynamics as we've come out of the pandemic. Are we seeing more normalized behavior with respect to forward booking, or is there anything to call out either in consumer behavioral geography in the forward booking trend that you'd want to highlight? And then in terms of thinking about the exit philosophy for Vrbo, is there a way to quantify elements of what One Key mix and easier comps might mean in terms of reacceleration at Vrbo at the end of the year? Thanks so much. Peter Kern: Sure. Thanks, Eric. I'll take a crack at both of those. I'd say broadly, yes, I mean, what we're seeing is a relative, what I would call a relative normalization of seasonal trends and booking trends. There's obviously some dynamics around what is opening or more newly opened, and what has been open for a while, as we've seen, for example, this summer with lots of travelers going to Europe, where maybe they didn't go last summer, Asia opening up, and more travelers going there. Of course, parts of Asia like China still don't have full airlift out of China. So there's still differences. But I think broadly in terms of the effect of like COVID, last year we had COVID first quarter, and then the second quarter was a huge quarter because things opened up after Omicron. That's kind of normalized out, and I think in terms of booking windows, booking trends, they're moving around a little bit, but by and large, they're normalizing to what I would call generally pre-pandemic patterns. So I think that's the main thing. In terms of geo, again Asia will open up more. There will be more travel there. We're seeing APAC and LATAM growing faster because of those things opening more recently. So that's certainly a trend. But again, I think that normalizes once it's been opened, call it a year or so. And then as far as Vrbo goes, very hard to quantify. And obviously, the switch, the sort of consumer switch from Vrbo or vacation rentals generally to more hotel started happening in the back half of last year and earlier this year. So that's sort of a macro trend as far, so we'll be lapping some of that now as we get into the back half of the year. But as far as our journey goes, yes, One Key we think is a big opportunity for us it's the first time that Vrbo customers will have loyalty. It's a chance to get them involved in our whole universe of products so we can bring them into the other products. Obviously now, Expedia members, hotels.com members can use their points on Vrbo. So we think that becomes a very attractive reason to use Vrbo. So we definitely think One Key will drive a lot of cross shopping between the products. Hard to quantify yet, but that's a core belief in what we are trying to do with One Key. And then as far as the migration goes, as we've talked about, you're changing the product, you're moving it across, the last piece will be moving the app, which is very binary, so you tend to do it at the end. That's still coming, but we're excited about what the product will be able to do. We're excited about having all the products on one stack and being able to innovate across all of it together. And as we've talked about for a long time, that will eventually lead us to be able to sell much more easily Vrbo products across all brands, across our B2B products, etc. So we don't have a number for you, but I think broadly, I think we're going to lap the macro trends of shift from vacation rental to hotels later this year, and then, the migration stuff will still be around for a few more months, bu we're excited about being past it and the opportunities that presents. Eric Sheridan: Great, thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lee Horowitz : Great, thanks. So you talked about some of your marketing spend getting pushed from the second quarter to the third quarter in order to support the One Key loss. Can you maybe help us better understand how this may have impacted the bookings and nights in the second quarter relative to your expectations, and then maybe relatedly, can you talk a bit about how you think lodging share pays throughout the second quarter and what your expectations are for share as you move through the balance of the year and you drive that extended growth across a number of your properties? Julie Whalen: Hi, it's Julie. I'll take the first one. Yes, I mean, obviously, I'm sure there was some impact to the second quarter as a result of our decision to shift the marketing. At the end of the day, our top line was hitting our expectations and obviously what we had told the street about mid-single digits, and so we thought the right choice of action was to take that spend and to get the best return to tie it nicely with our One Key launch and also to set us up for the back cap. So we made the decision to take that money and push it into the third quarter. But sure, could we have spent more and maybe gotten some incremental nights and bookings in the second quarter? Sure, but we thought this was a better path to take.Peter Kern: And then I think the share point plays into that. We feel like we've been holding share in our core markets. We've been gaining some of our outside North American markets, outside U.S. markets in a number of places. So again, as Julie said, it's all sort of placed in together, which is we're trying to, of course, drive the best return on our investments. We thought there was better return when we had the extra hook of One Key. We felt like we were holding in places and we could have spent the money to drive some more bookings into Q2, but we felt like the return was better, literally waiting weeks, many weeks to push it into July when we were launching with One Key. So it's a small movement in the scheme of things. Of course, it moves around margins a little bit and it moves around. Yes, it moves some bookings from maybe Q2 into Q3. And yes, it moves some even though maybe into Q2 instead of Q3. But in the scheme of things, we're trying to spend that money as efficiently as we can. We launched One Key as soon as we could basically and it would have been nice to obviously launch it sooner, but this is when we could get it out the door and we think that there's better returns attached to that hook and getting customers in, getting them engaged in One Key, getting those return dynamics and direct dynamics where we want them. So that's why in the scheme of things, not huge dollars or anything, but we moved a little money and sure, that cost us a little bit of [GBV] and revenue in Q2 and will mean a little bit of extra spend in Q3. Lee Horowitz : Helpful. Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Kevin Kopelman: Great. Thank you. As you think about the acceleration that you're looking for in the third quarter, the issue is being focused in U.S. and B2C given the One Key launch or is it going to be more broad-based? Peter Kern: I think it's a number of things. As I mentioned, Kevin, we are seeing good growth as we push back into some of our foreign markets where we saw opportunity and that's been going reasonably well. In the scheme of things, obviously, U.S. being so big for us to accelerate broadly, we also need the U.S. to accelerate, so that's a combination of a number of things which are, yes, One Key starting to kick in, but Q3 is early days, right? One Key is a loyalty program designed to incent return, certainly attractive in terms of make your first purchase and get value, but I don't think we're not expecting massive impact in Q3 from One Key. We're just seeing good acceleration in the market. Q2 comps were tough because of last year, and as Julie alluded to, some of the strange insurance dynamics and other things normalize out in the Q3 as we lap that and Q4. The acceleration is really just a continuation of, we see strong demand. We built this base of consumers that we continue to build on that are repeating more and having behaviors we like a lot more, and that just keeps building, and One Key enhances it, and that's really the core of it, but it's not just in the U.S. The growth is also outside the U.S., but I will say a lot of the acceleration certainly is coming from B2C as opposed to more acceleration in B2C. Kevin Kopelman: Great, thank you. And then could you just touch on the CapEx expectations for the rest of the year and drivers there? Thanks. Julie Whalen: Yes, I mean, we've seen CapEx come up even in the last quarter, and we had expected this. We are putting more into capitalized labor in order to hit our strategic initiatives this year. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation that we have still been pushing through this year, i.e., One Key launch and the verbal migration and things like that, and so literally this is just a function of higher capitalized labor to complete out these projects, and as we go forward, we don't expect it to be as much in these elevated levels as we will, and we'll start to get the return from these projects that we're putting in place. Kevin Kopelman: Great, thanks, Julie. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from BOA. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney: Okay, let's see, I want to ask two questions. One, the travel bot or the ChatGPT experience that you have on the site, what have you seen so far in terms of, I think there's enormous potential here. I just don't know how long that takes and whether there's just a ton of tweaking that needs to happen in order to really get it right. How do you feel? What have you seen so far in terms of engagement? Has it kind of led to increased conversion rates, and if not, maybe it's way too early, what's a reasonable expectation for when you could actually see that. And then the other thing is on One Key, now that you're rolling it out, can you set up an expectation for when you think we'll see kind of the impact that has, I know it's just recently launched, but is that something you take one quarter or is it one full year before you really can tell how successful that's been in terms of a deeper engagement and maybe attracting newer users? Thank you.Peter Kern: Yes, thanks Mark. So on ChatGPT, I agree with you. It's interesting. It has a ton of promise. It is early days. We've been studying it. I won't say it's moved the numbers in any way that you could see. And the customers who like to engage with it like to engage with it, lots of customers don't need it or don't choose to. I think the future though lies much more in a better integration, which will come as more large language models come out. And we figure out how to embrace them with our own data. Right now they kind of live separately and you can do a bunch of discovery with the tool and then save things and come investigate with us. Over time, there will be ways, I think, where we're not sharing your personal data with chatGPT, but where we can combine their capabilities with our data and use that to serve you better. So this is going to be an evolution of experience. That's why I mentioned we've been learning, we've been studying where customers get stuck, what they can't seem to do. Some of them don't exactly know how to engage or start a conversation. So there's a lot of work, not just by us, but by the industry around the large language models on prompts and other ways to get customers through it more easily. And I think all of those pieces will add up to more impact, but the impact now is basically the minimum, since you wouldn't see it in the numbers. As for One Key, I think that's more of a gradual build. Obviously, there's a couple of different things you're looking for. There's the appeal of having a strong, broad, flexible, best-in-class rewards program to attract customers and make them choose us over other people. And then there's the back-end part of, then do they come back directly once you've got them in their One Key program and hopefully once you've got them to download the app and now do they exhibit the behaviors of coming back? So that second part takes longer because as we all know, some people don't travel all that often, so it takes time for them to come back and book again, etc., even though many booked a lot. And then the first piece, we should start to see, as we literally just launched it, you may have seen the ads, the campaigns are out there, starting to put the messaging into all our performance marketing and anything that's out there digitally, etc., into our out-of-home. So it will continue to build, and you'll start to see it show up in all our marketing for all our brands. And we believe that's a hope that will continue to make intelligent consumers choose us because it will be a better value that gives them more back for their travel. So that part we should begin to see sooner, and that's why we think that will start to have a bigger impact into the back-end of this year. But the longer-range part of return and direct and driving those things, that will take a little longer to play out in the numbers. Mark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you very much, Peter. Peter Kern: You bet. Operator: Your next question comes in a line from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post: Great. Thank you. Sorry about the drop-off. Could you talk about the customer and the B2C customers? It seems like you're trying to improve that quality base, and maybe the street doesn't see it in the numbers yet. What gives you confidence there? Are you seeing higher repeat rates? You said you had some leverage in the quarter. Was that timing, or is there some real improvement you're seeing on the B2C side on marketing leverage? And then one question on One Key. Starting to see some discounts on the site, do you think that allows you to better compete against booking? And who's funding those? Thanks a lot. Peter Kern: Maybe I'll take those in reverse order. Take the sort of factual ones first. So yes, one of the pieces, not that relevant necessarily for the investment community, but that is important for the consumers, because we've expanded our member discounts as part of this One Key launch, so that where we used to have one level, basically, of member discounts, we now have, blue, silver, gold levels, and there are more discounts for higher tiered members, and that is part of the value proposition that we give to our consumers. Those are funded by our supply partners. It's a way for them to get to better and better higher value travelers, and that is an important added feature that we launched with, and we will be expanding over time.So that is certainly, booking has had tiered discounting from some of their supply partners, and that is a feature we have not had before, so I think, yes, that is a good competitive way. I will say that we also think we have those discounts on more valuable hotels that are worth more value to our customers who are more valuable. So, which goes to your first question, which is, yes, we have confidence that we are building a pool of more valuable customers, in the large part because we are getting them into more valuable states, so as we get them into membership, as we get them into app, and we follow how those cohorts perform, we know those cohorts perform for lots of good and thoughtful reasons, much better. So a member, of course, sees the member discounts, the loyalty rewards, and so forth, and app member does even more typically and comes back more directly, all good things. So as we build up those pools, and our blend of total consumers and total transacting consumers is blended towards these pools that have higher peak rates, higher LTV, et cetera, we are essentially building a bank of more value that is left to play out in the future. So that is why we do have confidence in what we are doing there. Obviously, we have done it particularly well as I talked about before in Expedia US, now we are doing it in more countries, now we are working on doing it with Hcom, and then expanding that to more countries, now we will be able to do it in Vrbo as well. So that is why we say we have a lot of runway left here, but we can see it happening where we have intent, where we have spent according to that, where we have driven the product, moved more customers into membership, and signed up into the app. Every step in that journey creates more value for us. Justin Post: Great, thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Anything you can share in terms of just early feedback, going back to One Key on maybe cross shopping, and then, changes in conversion rates at Vrbo, now that you have loyalty, anything interesting there, and then as part of that, anything in terms of cross currents from Hcom customers, given they are getting eluded there as part of One Key, would love some help understanding that. Peter Kern: Sure. I think the first one, the short answer is, it is too early. I mean, we have converted more than $70 million, don't have today's count, but over 70 million consumers into the One Key program. These are existing members, and also new members that have joined in the last few weeks. We've had lots of new members join in Vrbo. We've been able to activate, a customer who may be using Vrbo and may have been a customer of one of the other brands a long time ago, but now they're in a program where they'll see the benefit in the other brands. So we've done a lot of, sort of, the core work of getting customers aligned, getting their accounts right, getting their accounts consolidated if they had reports in different places, which was complicated. So we've made huge progress. It's too early to say that, there's not enough signal yet to say, well, people are, doing acting, behaving differently and doing lots of different things. And even in Vrbo, there's a lot of cross currents and a lot of the time is launching One Key. And a lot of our Vrbo customers, even though they're getting a great benefit, they're, they're having to understand, like, wait a minute, there's a membership program. What is it? Do I sign up to it? So there's the usual issues of launching something new and a product experience that people are accustomed to, but we've seen a lot of great response and, millions of sign-ups and I wouldn't say necessarily massively incremental in terms of the velocity, but just a lot of people engaging with it and signing up. And then as far as HGMP goes, yes, we have, there is a little bit of noise from our heaviest users about what does it mean for them. But I will say we've taken care of them. We've made sure that the value they had did not get diluted. And our view of the new program is that they get much more value through flexibility. They get value through the deeper discounts. We just talked about a member discount. So while it might not be constructed exactly the same, our heaviest users will get massive benefit and in our opinion, more benefit than they can get anywhere else in travel. So it's not like we went from, we love you and we give you all this and now we're going to devalue your program and not give you a lot. We're actually carrying over their value and we're giving them huge incremental flexibility, ways to spend their value on flights, on verbal, all kinds of things they couldn't do before and far more member discounts and other high-end benefits for our heaviest users, gold and platinum, et cetera.So they're going to get a ton of value and they just have to make, I think the industry has trained people to think they're going to lose out every time, loyalty program changes. This is not one of those circumstances. I won't say there's not a single customer who won't find that, they don't like this one as well as the last one. But this is a great program with a lot of value for the heaviest users and I think they will all come to understand it and love it. And appreciate the benefits. What they got, even though, it might be slightly different than it was. All right, thank you. Lloyd Walmsley: Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley Securities. Your line is open. Naved Khan: Yes, hi. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Peter, I think you, I heard you say you might have gained share in some of the international markets and I'm a little intrigued what may be driving that. Any kind of commentary there would be helpful. And then I will follow up. Peter Kern: Yes, I think it's really just intent on our part, as we reacted to COVID and we started rebuilding things, in a number of markets in the rest of the world, we back down spend a little bit and we got a little more conservative as we wanted to build our new mousetrap, as it were. And I think now that we have greater confidence in all the things I've talked about, be it membership, the value of app downloads, and so forth, we've been driving back into a number of international markets where we think there are good returns and we've been seeing nice returns. Now, these are modest changes in the scheme of things. There's nothing dramatic happening, but we're just seeing, what I call low hanging fruit and opportunity for us to move back into some of these markets in a smarter way. So, again, not a huge story there, just that, we feel good about share in the U.S., we feel good about what we're seeing, early signs as we push back into these international markets. So, on share , we're feeling reasonably good with more on this. Naved Khan: Understood. Yes. The follow up I had is just around advertising and we are hearing some commentary from other players about maybe some increased competition, maybe in Europe or other markets. I'm curious if you're seeing anything there or anything to say about Google's new ad format. I think they recently introduced proper understanding of their main search. Peter Kern: Yes. I think on the last part, you're talking about vacation rentals. Is that what you're talking about? Naved Khan: No, it's still, there's hotels, but I think this introduced a new format into the main search. Peter Kern: Yes. I mean, I would say, look, we're working with them and working in the auctions around the world all the time. I don't think we've seen anything particularly different in terms of inflation or not in the auctions. I mean, the auctions have been inflating over the last several years. And of course, they're highly competitive, particularly amongst the biggest of us. But no, I don't think we've seen anything that's of any concern, et cetera, over what's happening in terms of pricing in those markets. And of course, we are trying every day to find better opportunities, higher long-term return opportunities to invest our advertising dollars, be it in app downloads or other kinds of environments, shall I say, that encourage those behaviors, as opposed to just Google auctions. So I think we're probably not alone in that, but that's been a core part of our strategy as we've tried to get away from simply trying to buy transactions and getting much more focused on what consumers we buy, getting them into the right state in the app, and so forth. So that's an ongoing journey for us, but that's the direction that journey will keep going on forever. Naved Khan: Got it. Thank you, Peter. Peter Kern: Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jeffries. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Your line is open. Jed Kelly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just two, if I may. Just one, just the airlines that recently called out weaker domestic trends. Is there anything where there's just softening underlying demand or is that the pattern shifts that you kind of mentioned earlier? And then just thinking about your back half brand spend. Can you just talk about the efficiencies you plan to get on being able to market all your brands under one loyalty program versus marketing them all separately? And are you going to continue to market each of your key brands separately? Thanks.Peter Kern: Sure. So I think, yes, as far as the airlines go, I mean, we have seen, you've never heard that pricing is softened a little bit in domestic air in North America. There's a little bit more supply. And yes, there's been high demand for international. So I think it's been mostly a shifting of patterns. It's not total consumable dollars. Obviously, in every industry, not everybody participates the same way. Some are more domestically focused. Others have bigger international exposure. But in terms of consumer demand, I'd say it's broadly been steady and good, and there hasn't been -- there are places that fall and other places that rise. But overall, the consumer has been acting healthy and strong. So I don't think there's anything to see there other than moving, moving geographical trends and consumer trends in terms of what they're looking for. As far as brand spend, and again this isn't, I wouldn't get focused on the word brand spend, as we conventionally think about it, it is spend against our business, which could be brand spend, it could be performance marketing, it could be a lot of things. When we say we wanted it to support the One Key launch, it's not in the sense of like we needed money to buy TV spots, it's in the sense of we thought our money with the hook of One Key out the door would be more efficient as we drove consumption, be it through Google auctions or be it through digital advertising of various kinds or television. So that's what we were talking about. As far as how we're going to spend, we have a campaign out now that's very focused on One Key as a concept and the three of them coming together. But our intent is, at least for now, to keep marketing each brand, they will then, they will all have a touch point to One Key and make clear that they are, sibling brands and part of one big umbrella loyalty program, but they will each have their own brand identity in terms of what their consumer proposition is and how they deliver it to the consumer. Jed Kelly: Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your line is open. John Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the drop earlier. I want to talk a little bit about the One Key rollout. Can you help us understand what's changing from a loyalty perspective across each of the individual brands and how we should think about the sort of collective impact to take rate from these loyalty changes and perhaps some sort of other potential merchandising changes related to the rollout. And can you also help sort of talk a little bit more about the puts and takes of the acceleration in bookings growth? Next quarter, there's, the bites or slowdown in the system marketing spend and maybe some pull forward in the last quarter into Q1 from Q2. But I'm also curious if you've started to see an inflection point in some of the smaller brands where, they've gotten small enough to not have as material an impact on the overall business. Thanks. Peter Kern: A lot of good questions there. I would say starting with One Key, basically I think the simplest way to think about it is One Key is closest in what it offers to what the Expedia program was, the brand Expedia program was historically in that you earn points, the points are worth money, you can spend the money. Some things have changed. I mentioned the member discounts. You now have silver and gold member discounts. There's added benefits for those silver, gold, platinum members that they get. But it's most similar, so that's, I would say, the least change in the sense that you could already use that currency across many products and things. You couldn't really use, you couldn't use it in Vrbo, but that was the one missing piece. So maybe the way to think about that is you've added Vrbo to the pot and those consumers can now benefit when they want to rent a vacation rental. Hotel.com, many of you are familiar, had a very rich program for the super user. If you book 10 rooms, you get a night free, and that was a very valuable benefit for a super user, but the vast majority of users didn't get a benefit because they never stayed enough nights. So we're trying to make that program much more attractive to all users while still keeping it very attractive to the super user for all the points I went into a moment ago as to why they would find incremental value there. And again, you could only use that on hotel product. Now you can use it on anything. And that's a lot more flexible, a lot more vast, and you can do a lot more with it.And then, of course, Vrbo had nothing. Now Vrbo will have rewards, which Airbnb doesn't have, etc. And you'll be able to use it for your next Vrbo stay, but you can also use it to go to a hotel or a resort or take your family on a flight or whatever. So again, it just gives all of our customers a lot more ways to use it for a lot different occasions and for a lot different products. And ultimately, we're trying to build a base of loyal customers that use us for all their travel needs that can go across whatever they need and spend more with us, buy more products from us, etc. So that's the game. We have all these brands, all these capabilities. We wanted the customers to benefit from all of that. So the patterns we're looking for is cross shopping, more items per customer, higher LTVs, more direct, more app-direct, etc. So that's what we think One Key really helps drive. As far as the puts and takes in the back half of bookings, your point about the smaller brands, as part of it, yes, the smaller brands that we have to emphasize for some time now are getting smaller and that drag is getting lighter all the time. We mentioned some of the things going on with insurance normalizing post-COVID and a few strange effects there. That's normalizing in the back half of the year. And lodging continues to grow, B2C lodging continues to grow, for instance most through [indiscernible] but both brands are getting stronger in the back half after the tough comp. And so you're basically getting the strong pulling more weight and getting bigger, the sort of noisy stuff making less noise. And overall we see good velocity in the business right now and we're seeing it continue and we feel good about all the product improvements. I mean this has also been a journey of improving product, improving conversion, improving sign-in, improving app-down, like all of those things are part of that journey. So every day they're literally getting better and stacking up on themselves. So I think that's a long journey and there's no magic to why it's going to hit next Tuesday, but with Vrbo's migration done, with One Key, which is a huge amount of resource for us out the door, these things, the velocity of other innovation gets faster and faster. And that's what we're focused on. Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator: Our final question comes from a line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolf Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Julie, can you help us with the full year guide on margin expansion? We're almost into the peak travel season and you said that for 3Q, margin should be flat here on here. But anyway, you can frame for us what the full year margins can reach to. And then kind of related to that, how should we think about the headwind from fixed cost growth? You obviously have a little bit of a duplicative cost right now with all the replatforming efforts. Is there a timeline when we can expect this to somewhat sort of start to show leverage and maybe you can deploy them for other projects? Thanks so much. Julie Whalen: Sure. On the margin side, the EBITDA side, obviously this quarter's leverage certainly helps on the full year. We did guide to next quarter being more in line with last year. And that is, as you mentioned, the shift from the marketing spend that we have. But for all the things that Peter just alluded to, the strength of the business in the back half, particularly in the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong margin expansion in the fourth quarter that will help us on the year. So we're going to be operating top line, which will leverage the entire P&amp;L, including marketing leverage in the fourth quarter that we think will drive that expansion. From a headwind from a fixed cost perspective, certainly we are going to be aggressive as we move out of this year and come out of the transformation phase to finding efficiencies across the P&amp;L. As we've said, we have got redundant systems for very good reasons and migration, but it's time that we'll be starting to deprecate those systems and pulling costs out of the P&amp;L, and whether that's cloud costs, licensing and maintenance, repurposing some of the product and tech staff to now go on the offense and go after optimization and innovation instead of migration. There's a lot of opportunity to really dig through the cost and pull that out as we move forward, but that's probably more of a 2024 going forward focus. But certainly with all that optimization as well, we should be able to leverage the P&amp;L next year. So super excited about that. Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. Peter Kern: Yes, I think that was the final question. So thank you all. Have a good Thursday. Appreciate your time. Take care. Operator: That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.]"

Despite these encouraging figures, the question arises: is the stock a potential value trap? This article aims to explore this question using a comprehensive valuation analysis. Keep reading to gain valuable insights into the financial health and prospects of Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE).Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with EXPE. Click here to check it out. EXPE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of EXPEExpedia Group Inc, the world's second-largest online travel agency, boasts a diverse portfolio of travel booking sites, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Travelocity, Orbitz, Wotif, AirAsia, and Vrbo. The company also ventured into travel media with the acquisition of Trivago. The majority of Expedia's sales and profits come from transaction fees for online bookings. Its revenue streams include services for lodging (76% of total 2022 sales), air tickets (3%), rental cars, cruises, in-destination, and other (14%), and advertising revenue (7%).With a current stock price of $103.9, Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) has a market cap of $15 billion. However, the GF Value, a proprietary measure estimating the stock's fair value, stands at $179.79. This discrepancy prompts a deeper examination of the company's valuation.Is Expedia Group (EXPE) a Potential Value Trap? A GuruFocus Valuation AnalysisAbout GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique valuation model developed by GuruFocus. It estimates a stock's intrinsic value based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line, visible on our summary page, represents the stock's ideal fair trading value. If a stock's price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation, thus influencing future returns.According to our valuation method, Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) appears to be a potential value trap, warranting careful consideration before investment. The stock's fair value is estimated considering historical multiples, internal adjustments based on past business growth, and future performance estimates. If the stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued, potentially resulting in poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and could offer higher future returns.Story continuesIs Expedia Group (EXPE) a Potential Value Trap? A GuruFocus Valuation AnalysisLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Examining Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's important to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Examining the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Expedia Group has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.91, ranking better than 60.22% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Expedia Group's financial strength as 5 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is Expedia Group (EXPE) a Potential Value Trap? A GuruFocus Valuation AnalysisProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those demonstrating consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Expedia Group has been profitable 9 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company reported a revenue of $12.1 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.97. Its operating margin is 9.82%, ranking better than 61.27% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Expedia Group at 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. Our research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Expedia Group's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 53.73% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Expedia Group's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -7.1%, ranking worse than 66.17% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.ROIC vs WACCReturn on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to finance its assets. Ideally, ROIC should be higher than WACC. For the past 12 months, Expedia Group's ROIC is 2.56, and its WACC is 8.75.Is Expedia Group (EXPE) a Potential Value Trap? A GuruFocus Valuation AnalysisPotential Value Trap IndicatorsWhile Expedia Group's stock may seem undervalued based on the GF Value, certain signs indicate potential risks. The company's Altman Z-score stands at 0.8, placing it in the distress zone and signaling an increased bankruptcy risk. Ideally, a Z-score above 2.99 indicates a safer financial position. The Z-score, particularly relevant for manufacturing companies, considers various factors such as profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and activity ratios. To understand the Z-score's role in assessing a company's financial risk, please click here.ConclusionIn summary, Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) appears to be a potential value trap. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 66.17% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.

A Comprehensive AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line indicates the ideal fair trading value of the stock. It's computed considering three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is believed to be fairly valued. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given PulteGroup's current price of $84.19 per share and a market cap of $18.5 billion, the stock appears to be fairly valued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesIs PulteGroup Inc (PHM) Stock Fairly Valued?

And while some areas, such as bariatric surgery, are feeling the pinch, newly public Allurion Technologies (ALUR) says the focus on weight loss has been a boost for business.The company, which makes a gastric balloon that doesn't require regular surgery, de-SPACed this week and went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Its new board includes medtech veteran Omar Ishrak, who told Yahoo Finance that weight loss is ""a massive market"" and ""there is room for everybody here.""Ishrak, who has served as CEO of Medtronic (MDT) and GE Healthcare Systems (GEHC), said Allurion can fit into the weight loss market in the same way the cardiac disease space has multiple players today.""Thirty to 40 years ago, surgery was the only option. Then stents came along, statins came along, all kinds of drugs came along and everyone found a home for themselves,"" Ishrak said.""Obesity is a much bigger market and these things will settle down over time,"" he added. In fact, he said, the current frenzy is a tailwind for the company.""This attention to obesity, that these drug companies essentially are driving, in many ways makes this almost an optimum time for Allurion to go public and make a name for themselves,"" Ishrak said.Ishrak also leads Compute Health, the SPAC that merged with Allurion in February.The transaction has been successful beyond expectations, said CEO Shantanu Gaur.""We were looking to raise $70 million ... we ended up going public with $100 million of cash on the balance sheet. And that is rare in this environment, and it gives us a competitive edge in a market where a lot of companies are strapped for cash or in preservation mode,"" Gaur said.The pace of investments in technology and medical devices in the first half of 2023 was slow compared to previous years fueled by the pandemic. Gaur sees the move to be a public company amid the attention on weight loss as a key to success.Story continuesAllurion has already provided 100,000 patients with its gastric balloon, which claims to help patients lose between 10%-15% of their weight over a four-month span. In addition, the company provides behavioral health services that help keep patients adherent to lifestyle changes that can maximize the impact of the balloon.Which is why Ishrak is confident about Allurion's place in the market.""There will be cases where the balloon is the appropriate therapy, there will be cases where GLP-1 is the appropriate therapy, and there may be cases in the future where the two of them combine in some way,"" Ishrak said.GLP-1s, the category of popular injectables like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro — the Type 2 diabetes and weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) — have gained popularity due to their successful weight loss results ranging from 14%-24%. But the overwhelming demand has created a shortage for some products.Allurion Technologies' gastric weight loss balloon. (Allurion Technologies)'How big can it get?'""What these GLP-1 drugs have done, as a tailwind for our business, is bring millions of people out of their homes and into the doctor's office, talking about weight loss. These people would normally not have viewed obesity and weight loss as a medical issue, and now they are,"" Gaur told Yahoo Finance.He says the conversation around weight loss today is validation for the company, which began in 2009.""I remember when people questioned whether the obesity market was even worth going after. That entire narrative has shifted over the last 18 months. Now they're [asking], how big can it get?"" Gaur said.Estimates range from $75 billion to more than $100 billion by 2030, he said.""That's a much better framing for a total addressable market for us than where we were even a few years ago,"" Gaur said.Additionally, Gaur sees a sizable market for patients who may not want to take the injectable drugs. Whether they are averse to drugs, can't afford them, or end up getting off them after starting — those all add up to potential customers.That's at least what he has seen in the 60 countries the company operates in.""I don't really see GLP-1s as competition. I see them as building massive amounts of awareness and creating new pools of patients that are interested in losing weight,"" Gaur said.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

My name is Nicky, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Goodyear's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today, on the call, we have Rich Kramer, Goodyear's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christina Zamarro, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Goodyear will refer to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more information on the most significant factors that could affect future results, please refer to the important disclosures section of Goodyear's second quarter 2023 investor letter and their filings with the SEC, which can be found on their website at investor.goodyear.com, where a replay of this call will also be available.A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed on today's call to the comparable GAAP measures is also included in the investor letter. This call will focus on questions and answers.Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Please, go ahead.Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is [Jake] calling in for James. First, I just want to talk about is the third quarter bridge items. So if I work through those, we get to about $300 million SOI in 3Q. I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about that right. And then looking at full year it looks like the implied guide, it's about [indiscernible] million. So, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter?Christina Zamarro: Yes. Sure. Hi, Jake. This is Christina. So I'll start on SOI and I would say if you look at our outlook obviously we are layering in the trends in the industry that we're seeing as we look into the third and fourth quarters, and as we think about how this has played out, obviously impacts in our earnings in Q2 due to transitory factors like destocking more in consumer but also more recently in commercial. And so, what that means is volume weakness still yet in Q3 and a lot of that is due to our plan for some additional destocking, particularly in Europe with volume approximately flat to up in the back half over the fourth quarter. When I think about the drivers of our SOI block, I mean we've laid out the industry assumptions for you unabsorbed overhead wins, I think we'll have lower Q2 production of about four million units, excluding to below that obviously will impact the fourth quarter.Story continuestire factory, tire manufacturerCopyright: baranq / 123RF Stock PhotoWe've given you those values as well. Price mix versus raw materials should more than offset other cost inflation in the second half, I'd say that that's true on a full-year basis as well. If I think about commercial truck, and maybe this gets to the heart of your question, what we said is big impact $60 million in mix in the second quarter that declines pretty significantly in Q3 and it's pretty much not an impact at all in our fourth quarter. When I look at fourth quarter price mix versus raw materials what I would say is obviously really strong benefits and lower raw material costs. We do have RMI index is beginning to take effect. But I would say that there is still relatively small here in the fourth quarter, something like 10% of that raw material benefit.So hopefully that's helpful.Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then it looks like channel destocking was a pretty big drag on the quarter. When should we expect that trend to start to reverse.

(NYSE:CCI) delivered a -21.11% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -40.01%. The stock closed at $107.00 per share on August 02, 2023. Here is what Aristotle Value Equity has to say about Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""Crown Castle, the largest U.S. provider of shared communications infrastructure—cell towers, small cells and fiber—was the largest detractor from performance. The company reported a decline in fiber revenue and a deceleration in tower sales growth during the quarter after record network spending by wireless carriers in 2022 (related to the ongoing rollout of 5G). We continue to appreciate the benefits of management’s differentiated strategy to remain 100% focused on the U.S. while many competitors have instead sought to expand their tower businessesinternationally. We believe Crown Castle’s approach delivers a compelling value proposition as the company’s customers seek to utilize shared infrastructure while making multi‐ billion‐dollar investments in spectrum assets. Although carriers have generally pulled back from network spending this year, we continue to find the structure of Crown Castle’s tower business attractive. This includes the ability to implement a nearly 3% annual price escalator on tower rental rates, the low capital investment needed to maintain its towers and sticky customers with an over 95% renewal rate over the last 5 years. Looking past the short‐term movements in demand, we believe that, over the long term, the company is well‐poised to gain market share and also improve its profitability as it increases the average number of tenants per tower. In addition, management reiterated it is on pace to deploy 10,000 small cell nodes in 2023 (approximately doubling last year’s results). As such, we view Crown Castle as uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to 5G networks, since the company’s portfolio skews toward urban areas where densification of populations, infrastructure and networks enhances the value proposition of small cells.""Story continuesArkansasSTUDIO GRAND OUEST/Shutterstock.com Our calculations show that Crown Castle Inc.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The increase mainly came from Airbus' A320neo, A321neo and A350-900, while the contribution to China's fleet from Boeing's 737 MAX 8 and 787-9 were relatively marginal over the same period.""Hence, despite the lack of Boeing orders from China's airlines, growth has still been possible albeit clearly not at the same trajectory as seen in the mid-part of the last decade,"" said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium.Last year, Boeing said it was disappointed that ""geopolitical differences continued to constrain US aircraft exports"" in response to China's three biggest state-owned airlines buying 300 jets from Airbus.But the Chicago-based aerospace company may be able to stage a comeback as the average age of Chinese airlines' fleet has risen significantly over the past five years.China's fleet will require more new planes to facilitate growth and replacements following disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the suspension of the production of the 737 MAX, according to Morris.Story continuesChina was the first country to ground the 737 MAX in March 2019 after 346 people died in two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia less than five months apart, and Boeing's flagship narrowbody passenger jet only returned to service in China in January.Cirium's most recent fleet forecast in November projected that airlines in China will need some 2,800 new narrowbody jets and 600 new widebody jets over the next 10 years. The average age of a narrowbody passenger jet in China is 8.7 years and 7.6 years for a widebody aircraft, the Cirium fleet data showed.Given both Boeing and Airbus currently hold a large order backlog, Chinese airlines may increasingly find it difficult to secure delivery slots before 2030, Morris added.""Hence, if Boeing are permitted to recommence deliveries into China once again, then there may be an opportunity for the company to sell more units if there are slots available,"" Morris said.In July, Boeing executive vice-president Stan Deal met the head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, Song Zhiyong, in Beijing, according to a statement from the regulator. The two exchanged views on Boeing's business development in China and the strengthening of US-China civil aviation cooperation, the statement added.Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in an earnings call with analysts at the end of July that more than 90 per cent of its 737 MAX were now back in service in China, and that the company is receiving ""a lot of good signs"" when it comes to resuming deliveries.""We are not dependent on it. We want to do it, and we certainly want to support our customers in China. And we will be the free-trade beacon with respect to our administration and - and all the political influences,"" said Calhoun.""But I'm just going to leave it postured just the way it has been. Know that we have 85 airplanes that we would like to begin delivery on.""Stephen Olson, a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation, believes that Airbus remains ""geopolitically better positioned than Boeing"" to meet the demand from China's state-owned airlines.""As the US-China geostrategic rivalry continues to play out, China needs to curry favour with the European Union (EU) in order to prevent the EU from aligning too closely with the more confrontational policies being pursued by the US,"" said Olson, a former trade negotiator with the Office of the US Trade Representative.""A fully united US-EU common front on China policy would be highly problematic for Beijing.""And ordering from Airbus, rather than Boeing, could also be an effective way to remind the EU of the economic benefits of maintaining positive and constructive relations with China, Olson added.China's heavy investment in grooming a domestic champion in the civil aviation industry also means that the need to order from foreign competitors is diminishing, Olson said.A second C919, the narrowbody passenger jet built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), to enter service made its first commercial flight with China Eastern Airlines this week.The C919, which is designed to compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320, was formally put into service with its maiden commercial flight in May after 15 years of development.Comac has said its annual production capacity is expected to reach over 150 in the next five years.Olson said that the US would continue to seek to expand trade with China away from sensitive sectors, despite rising tensions and the various bilateral restrictions.On Monday, Bloomberg News reported that US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo is set to visit Beijing later this month, citing unidentified sources.Raimondo has previously criticised Beijing for preventing its domestic airlines from buying Boeing planes.""As secretary of commerce, Gina Raimondo is America's business ambassador, and I would expect that expanding US exports would be on the agenda of almost any meeting she has with foreign officials,"" Olson added.""Whether or not Boeing will specifically be on the agenda for her upcoming meetings in Beijing is hard to know at this point, but pushing for greater market access is a foundational cornerstone of any commerce secretary's portfolio.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Amid the turmoil, key biotech stocks have become the targets of activist investors demanding new executives, new boards and new strategies. The specifics of each case vary, but the biotech stocks in sharpest focus have been those whose earnings and revenue have disappointed investors.Of course, it’s no accident this happens. Investors want to protect their investments. And if the company isn’t acting right, they are well within their rights to try to change. If their changes succeed, it could prove a key turnaround for a company’s future. Many high-potential biotech stocks could see themselves skyrocket after these changes — and investors know it.But companies will always fight back. Change doesn’t happen easily, and overturning the inertia of the board, the executives and other shareholders takes time — sometimes quite a while. But these biotech stocks can still benefit from showing resilience during the turmoil and ending uncertainty afterward. A keen investor knows that a crisis is also an opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUltimately, it’s important to know what’s at stake, whether you side with investors or companies. So, amid the turmoil, here are three high-potential biotech stocks to watch.Biogen (BIIB)BIIB stock: Biogen Factory Building in: Luterbach Solothurn SwitzerlandSource: PictureDesignSwiss / Shutterstock.comBiogen’s (NASDAQ:BIIB) most promising drugs, Aduhelm and Leqembi, were expected to be game-changers. But investors have not been impressed. Both drugs are monoclonal antibodies designed to target beta-amyloid — a protein found clumped together in those with Alzheimer’s disease. Biogen’s initial rollout of these drugs generated significant excitement, but investor concerns led to a failed investor lawsuit and a new chief executive officer (CEO).The controversy centered around the slow uptake of both drugs. Concerns about limited efficacy and potentially life-threatening side effects like brain bleeds have led some doctors to hesitate in prescribing them. Both Aduhelm and Leqembi have been slow to gain traction in the market. And investors claimed Biogen misled them, although a judge dismissed the case.Story continuesTo assuage its investors, Biogen needs to find ways to improve the uptake of its flagship drugs. The company could focus on identifying patient subsets where the products have clear success rates, showing doctors they can be effective in certain populations — despite concerns. Or, Biogen could find ways to reduce the concerning side effects. Either way, safety and efficacy will be key to adoption.Biogen’s financial situation is heading in the wrong direction, which is why these new drugs are so critical. Its Q2 2023 earnings showed revenue of $1.8 billion, down from $2.1 billion in Q2 2022. Net income decreased to $593 million from $1 billion in Q2 2022. Biogen has announced it will reduce staff by 11% to cut costs, but that may not be enough to satisfy investors.Ultimately investors’ worries over the Alzheimer’s drug rollout have had an effect. But if Biogen can regain investors’ confidence, they could regain their crown as a high-potential biotech stock to buy.Illumina (ILMN)Illumina (ILMN) logo displayed on reddish stone facade building against blue sky backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhotoIllumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a major player in genetic sequencing and a key biotech stock to watch, has faced a difficult battle with activist investor Carl Icahn. In 2021, Illumina acquired cancer detection company GRAIL in a vertical integration merger. Since GRAIL’s assays used Illumina equipment, this would have strengthened Illumina’s position in the market. However, antitrust regulators opposed the move, and Illumina was ordered to divest from the company in 2023.Illumina fought a long battle with regulators, which raised the ire of Carl Icahn. Icahn believed the fight with regulators was detrimental to shareholders. He also sought to remove the chief executive officer (CEO) and install his own candidates to the board.Icahn’s tactics worked, and his candidates were placed on the board while Illumina’s CEO resigned. The interim CEO will stay on until July 31, which puts Illumina at a crossroads. How much Icahn supports the new CEO could be crucial to the company’s long-term investor relations. Likewise, the new company executive could signal future priorities about whether Illumina will continue to seek vertical integration with companies using its products or focus on itself.No matter what happens, Illumina is still a major player in genetic sequencing. While its Q1 2023 earnings report showed revenue and net income down from a year ago, it still has a huge customer base and room to grow. Whether the company continues to look outward or focus inward, it is still a high-potential biotech stock in the sequencing industry. That makes ILMN a biotech stock any investor should watch.Exelixis (EXEL)The logo for Exelixis is displayed on a phone.Source: Shutterstock.comExelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) has been in a clash with Farallon Capital Management (privately held) over its R&amp;D strategy. Farallon has expressed concerns about Exelixis’ oversized research and development (R&amp;D) budget and its pursuit of various drug strategies. The company advocates for a more focused approach, concentrating on a few core competencies. Additionally, Farallon is pushing for a larger share buyback to further enhance shareholder value.While Farallon is not pushing for overwhelming changes, it is still affecting Exelixis. During the initial skirmish, Farallon succeeded in securing three board seats. Exelixis tried to defend its strategy in the court of public opinion but did not persuade many investors.Ultimately Exelixis remains at a crossroads, with Farallon demanding cuts and the company pushing for growth. If Exelixis can pull together a string of strong clinical trials or even drug approval, the company could defend its strategy more easily against Farallon. But if investors think revenue cannot meet R&amp;D demands, they’ll be more likely to side with Farallon.Exelixis’s Q1 2023 earnings report showed net product revenue growth from $310 million to $363 million. However, R&amp;D expenses grew from $157 million to $234 million, decreasing net income from $68.6 million to $40 million. That highlights the turmoil with Farallon. If R&amp;D continues to grow too fast, the company will become unprofitable. Investors should look toward Exelixis’ next earnings report on August 1st to see which direction the company is heading.Ultimately, Exelixis versus Farallon is the classic battle between growth and profit. But Exelixis has proven to be a resilient biotech stock to watch.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks David, Brian, and Eric will be available for Q&amp;A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for the integration and transaction-related costs. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I will turn the call over to David.Story continues15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The WorldDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a strong performance, fueled by continued growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Today, I will review key strategic drivers contributing to our momentum and why we believe we are well-positioned to sustain our growth as we continue to support the health and vitality of those we serve with our differentiated solutions and capabilities. Brian will cover additional details about our financial performance in the quarter and our 2023 outlook. As part of our ongoing effort for you to hear more from members of our leadership team Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services, will be joining our call and is available to take your questions. With that, let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $48.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. We are pleased with our performance overall during the quarter and through the first half of the year. With focus on affordability and innovation, we are continuing to strengthen our competitive position and grow our businesses. In Evernorth Health Services, we saw another strong quarter of our market-leading pharmacy, care and benefits portfolio. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business, harnesses our deep relationships, extensive clinical expertise and is delivering innovations and innovative solutions for those we serve. We've long been a leader in supporting access to prescription drugs and, to further enhance our efforts, we took a series of actions in the quarter, including launching Copay Assurance to support further affordability for patients, and ClearCareRX to provide our clients with broader choice. We also introduced [Independent Rx] (ph), which is a first-of-its-kind support program for rural pharmacists that recognizes the critical role they play in improving access for millions of Americans. We will continue to lead the way through the current environment of elevated legislative and regulatory activity and we are encouraged by the positive recognition of our work to make safe, effective and affordable access of prescription drugs within reach for millions of people who need them. Our client retention is also strong, and we are continuing to build and expand new relationships. For example, we are making good progress for implementation with Centene, which begins on January of 2024. Our teams are working collaboratively and we are on track as we prepare to further improve affordability in serving 20 million Centene customers. In the quarter, we had strong growth in Accredo, our specialty pharmacy business. In a moment, I'll profile the deep clinical expertise and capabilities that make Accredo a differentiated leader in this space. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered another quarter of organic customer growth, reinforcing how well our consultative approach and capabilities continue to resonate in the market. Our U.S. commercial business continues to build momentum. We've had sustained success with commercial customer growth outpacing the overall market and 2023 is shaping up to be another very strong year for this business. With our affordability initiatives and deep consultative sales approach, we are delivering highly competitive total cost of care for employer clients, as well as providing programs supporting healthy engaged workforces that they need. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market customer growth with high-quality affordable plans and targeted investments that we continue to make to further strengthen our network and offerings. In our individual exchange business, we will continue taking a focused approach by engaging customers to improve health outcomes and managing risks in the expanding population we serve. In the quarter, while our medical care ratio was generally in line with expectations, we did have an increase to our 2023 risk adjustment payable. Relative to the risk [adjuster] (ph) impact, we expect this to be a 2023 event, and we've already taken actions for 2024. And in our international health business, we drove continued innovation and growth in target markets with solutions for the [globally mobile] (ph) population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Overall, our second quarter results showed that The Cigna Group is performing well with underlying strength in our complementary businesses. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our company and delivering on our commitments. With the strength of our results, we are increasing our outlook for full year revenue and customer growth, as well as cash flow from operations, and we are reaffirming that we are on track to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023. Now, I will talk about how we are working to sustain our momentum with our differentiated and diversified capabilities and our durable strategic growth framework. Our framework guides us in continuing to respond to customer, patient and client needs, as well as capturing growth opportunities within our foundational businesses and our accelerated growth businesses. Additionally, we harness the power of our talent, client relationships and partnerships, as well as an expanding technology portfolio for cross-enterprise leverage. Technology increasingly provides us with opportunities to accelerate innovation and growth. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, are capabilities further enhancing ways for us to support patients and their clinical care teams, as well as drive additional efficiency initiatives. Today, I'll talk more about one of our accelerated growth businesses, Accredo, our flagship specialty pharmacy, where we have a competitive advantage in an area of growing needs and opportunity. Earlier this summer, we welcomed a group of investors to Warrendale, Pennsylvania at one of our Accredo clinical care sites. The visit provided an opportunity to see the breadth of our specialty capabilities and the depth of our clinical expertise, a critical driver for the positive outcomes and impact we achieve for patients requiring complex and high-cost treatments for chronic conditions. Here are a few headlines from the day at Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. Nearly five years ago when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, Accredo was approximately a $30 billion business. Today, Accredo has grown to approximately $60 billion. And in 2023, serves approximately 900,000 patients with some of the most complex conditions and needs. Accredo now represents about 40% of Evernorth's total revenue, and because of its unique strengths, Accredo has grown faster than the overall marketplace. Second, these secular tailwinds in the market create significant growth opportunities as we look to the future. Those who need specialty drugs make up about 5% of the population and they drive more than 40% of total healthcare costs across medical, behavioral and pharmacy services. This is fueling expected mid to high single-digit annual growth in what is already a specialty pharmaceutical market of approximately $380 billion. Biosimilars represent force of change and a substantial opportunity for further growth and impact, and we will leverage them for greater affordability for clients and patients. We've long been a leader in supporting greater adoption of biosimilars as we did with the wave of generic medications when they became available decades ago. And like generics, we believe biosimilars will drive much-needed affordability improvements for those we serve and thereby create more financial capacity to pay for new pharmaceutical innovations today and as we look to the future. Third is the breadth of our clinical capabilities and use of data that further fuels precision and impact. We built and strengthened our clinical capabilities and far-reaching operating model over decades. Within Accredo, we have therapeutic resource centers with clinical teams of pharmacists, nurses, dietitians and social workers specializing in different disease states, such as blood and neurological disorders and multiple types of cancers. Unlike many of our competitors, we directly employ hundreds of field-based infusion nurses. Today, they are located within 75 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population. And as they care for patients inside their homes, they provide better, more coordinated and personalized experiences, including addressing social determinants of health. With the clinical care model focused on each individual patient, we are able to provide a level of personalized clinical support that is vital in specialty pharmacy. Many new high-cost drugs for oncology, gene therapies and rare conditions are coming to market, further pressuring affordability for clients and requiring greater support for patients that take these complex medications safely and effectively. I would note, drug manufacturers also recognize our expertise and capabilities, as well as our superior outcomes that we produce with our unique, coordinated clinical model. Putting all this together, we are excited about the accelerated growth opportunities we have with Accredo's differentiated specialty pharmacy, and view it as a powerful growth engine for our company today and into the future. Now, stepping back to the enterprise level, I'll briefly recap. We drove strong earnings that built on our momentum from the first quarter and last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.13, strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth. Our progress gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance of adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023, and we also remain on track for adjusted EPS of at least $28.00 in 2024. This reinforces how we are creating value for our customers and clients and leveraging differentiated capabilities to give us flexibility to continue performing well in a dynamic environment. Now, Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian? Brian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting continued execution across the enterprise. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include: revenue growth of 7% to $48.6 billion; after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $6.13; and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Revenue and cash flow both exceeded expectations, while adjusted earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations. Our two platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting solid top- and bottom-line growth, while Cigna Healthcare delivered results in line with expectations despite an unfavorable risk adjustment impact in our individual exchange business, which I will discuss shortly. First, turning to Evernorth results. Evernorth continues to deliver strong performance. With second quarter 2023 revenues growing 10% to $38.2 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our differentiated specialty pharmacy business, which had year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and our focus on providing a variety of solutions that drive affordability and lowest net cost for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build out our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, harnessing data and technology to accelerate innovation for customers and clients. And we also continue to make strategic investments to further enhance and expand our client relationships, diversify our portfolio of products and services, prepare for new clients in 2024, and advance our technology capabilities. Overall, Evernorth has delivered strong first half results and we are well-positioned as we look to the back half of the year. Our diversified solutions allow us to sustain momentum by delivering differentiated value to our customers and clients, helping them overcome key healthcare challenges. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.2%. The medical care ratio reflects some items specific to our individual exchange business that largely offset one another in the quarter. After receiving our first view of industry-wide risk adjustment data in early July, we increased our full year 2023 estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable. It's important to note, this was primarily driven by two states. Within those two states, the unfavorable impact from the first half of 2023 was about $80 million, and was recognized in the second quarter. We expect a similar magnitude of impact in the back half of the year. Additionally, this impact is isolated to the 2023 calendar year, as we have taken corrective pricing actions and the impact to geographies in our 2024 rate filings. Specific to the second quarter, the unfavorable risk adjustment payable impact was largely offset by a favorable update to our 2022 risk adjustment receivable within the individual exchange business. Underlying fundamentals across the Cigna Healthcare segment continued to perform well as we further expanded our relationships and delivered affordability for our customers and clients. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we planned and priced for more normalized levels of utilization this year. Our year-to-date claims experience has been broadly in line with this expectation across both Commercial and Medicare Advantage. Turning to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers year-to-date across all businesses. Within our government business, medical customers grew sequentially, and year-to-date, Medicare Advantage has grown 12%. Overall, Cigna Healthcare's results in the quarter were solid as we demonstrated strong underlying fundamentals, despite the increased 2023 individual exchange risk adjustment payable previously mentioned, and we continue to grow our customer and client relationships, providing differentiated value and driving affordability. Now, turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $190 billion, driven by continued strength in our businesses as we continue to deliver innovative services and solutions for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $24.70 per share, and we expect adjusted EPS to be split approximately evenly between the third and fourth quarters. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. With respect to Evernorth earnings cadence, we expect mid-single digit year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the third quarter, and mid to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter. In Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. We expect third quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly below 55% of second half adjusted earnings to reflect seasonal patterns as well as the rate and pace of investments. This incorporates the impact from the estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable in the second half of the year, which is offset by other items in Cigna Healthcare, including expense efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to expect our 2023 medical care ratio to be within the range of 81.5% to 82.3%. Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through August 2, 2023, we have repurchased approximately $3.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $500 million to at least $9.5 billion for the full year. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now, to recap, second quarter results were strong, reflecting high-quality underlying fundamentals in our foundational and accelerated businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.70, and we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.00, consistent with our prior commentary. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&amp;A portion of the call. See also 15 European Countries with Best Healthcare for Expats and 15 Most Consumed Meats in the World.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question. Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the color on the risk adjustment dynamics. I think that helps also explain some of the rate increases that we've seen you filing in some of those pertinent states like Georgia for 2024. My question is if we back out the risk adjustment impacts from both '22 and '23, can you give us an update on how you view sort of underlying utilization and cost trends in the marketplace and the individual business for 2023? And how you'd say sort of core, I guess, exchange margins are tracking towards your longer-term view in '23? And as you put these price increases in for '24, how that will sync up relative to the long-term sort of 4% to 6% pre-tax margins that you've historically sort of managed the individual business for? Thanks. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. I'll try to take each of those bites kind of one at a time. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in the quarter, we had an $80 million impact from the risk adjustment payable matter in 2023, which reflects essentially a true-up for the first two quarters of the year. But that was largely offset in the quarter by the favorable true-up we had on the 2022 risk adjustment settlement. The other residual piece within the individual exchange business is we had some favorable claim cost experience in the first half of the year. So, the $80 million was offset largely by the 2022 risk adjustment settlement, but also, to a lesser degree, by favorable cost trend within our individual exchange business, which reflects a younger, healthier population than what we had in 2022. So claim costs there, certainly within check, but we had the larger payable, which creates the pressure point for the year. As it relates to the profit margins and how to think about where we are in '23 and the rate increase impact on '24, just for some context here, you can think of this business being approximately a $5 billion block for us in 2023 in terms of premium revenue. And we had shared on a prior call that we were anticipating the individual exchange book to run below our target margins within 2023. As you noted, our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%. For the remainder of this year, we're expecting another $80 million of risk adjustment payable impact across the second half, which, as I mentioned, will be offset by the strength across the broader Cigna Healthcare portfolio, including expense efficiencies. But when you put all this together, the individual exchange margins in 2023 will be below our prior estimates. And for 2024, we have taken sizable price increases in our two largest states. So we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual exchange book overall in '24 relative to '23. The exact amount of that margin improvement will end up being a function of our geographic and customer mix in 2024 as we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business in 2024 relative to where we are in 2023. So, thanks for the question. Hopefully, you can follow all those moving pieces. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I know at this point in the year, large employers are well on their way to thinking about their '24 outlook as -- both from health benefits and also on the pharmacy benefit side. I wondered if given you've got a great window on all of that, anything interesting to call out in terms of priorities for employers around benefit design, focus on particular categories of healthcare, whether -- I know sometimes it's diabetes, sometimes family planning. Anything on the cost management focus? I know there's a lot of discussion about GLP-1s, and wonder whether they're focused on trying to manage that more effectively. And then, just overall expectations in those customers around cost trends and -- are they assuming it's sort of a more normalized outlook going into '24, or are they making any assumptions about pent-up demand or anything?David Cordani: A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me describe a little bit of the -- we'll say the buying characteristics and areas of focus in the market more broadly, and then I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of the pharmacy specific space and using your GLP-1 as an example. So, stepping back, and it's for the latter part of your comment to reinforce it, the buying behaviors continue to have an intense focus on, what I will call, base buying needs focused on affordability, coupled with consistent high-quality service levels. There's two additional dimensions, I would say, that have intensified recently relative to need state. One, as employers, because you're coming at through the employee lens, continue to intensify their focus on having healthy, engaged, highly-productive workforce. They're intensifying their focus and need and awareness of the complex behavioral health needs from their population, inclusive of, but also beyond the more intense behavioral health dimensions. This includes anxiety, stress, depression and complexity to come along with that. Here, I would note that within our Cigna Group portfolio of solutions, we're well positioned to meet the needs, because there's a lot of coordination that's necessary to advance there. The second trend I'd highlight is what the marketplace is sometimes calling point solution fatigue, where over time, employers have aggregated many individual point solutions that made sense at a given moment in time, but they find themselves stepping back and looking at that inventory, questioning whether or not either, a, they're getting all the value out of each individual solution, or b, the friction and/or abrasion for their coworkers or medical professionals is worth the value of the fractured point solutions, and therefore, are challenging more opportunities to coordinate or integrate solutions to get more value, leverage and better service from that standpoint. And again, our portfolio is really well positioned there and continues to resonate in the market as evidenced by our growth. I'll ask Eric to provide a little bit of color of areas of focus for buyers more broadly in pharmacy, including the GLP-1. Eric Palmer: Great. Thanks, David. Good morning, A.J. I'll start with the GLP-1. GLP-1s are definitely top of mind for many of our clients. There's been a meaningful uptick in utilization here. And as I think you know, we have coverage for these medications on our formularies from early on for value-based arrangements with pharma manufacturers. We've seen contributions for the benefit of patients and our clients by result of those -- the structures. We have recently launched a program called ENCIRCLERX, which brings together management of the GLP-1, cardiac, diabetic conditions, obesity. So these conditions often tend to be interrelated, to bring together a benefit plan design, the clinical support as necessary and the overall resources we can bring to help these patients, better manage their health and ultimately get to a better plan costs. So, at GLP-1 and the broader cardiac, obesity, diabetes space is a real area of focus. I would also note, as David touched on in his comments, continued interest in behavioral solutions. That's an area that we've got strong expertise within Evernorth, and we're excited about the opportunities in that market and the need to help manage behavioral care more effectively. Those will probably be the top couple of specific themes I would call out at this point, A.J. A.J. Rice: All right. Thanks a lot. Operator: Thank you Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Justin Lake: Thanks. A couple of quick questions. One, just so I appreciate your comments on cost trend, but did see a pretty big pickup in medical costs payable in the quarter relative to reserve growth. Just curious what drove that. And then, just stepping back, the stop loss business has seen a nice acceleration this year, up in the teens. Just curious what you're seeing there. And do you expect that to be the kind of the trajectory after we've seen a bit of a slowdown over the last few years? Thanks. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll start, and I think David will pile on in terms of the stop loss component. So, as it relates to our medical cost payables or reserves, nothing particular I'd flag here. We continue to employ a consistent methodology as it relates to how we set our reserves. There'll be some natural variability in this metric as product mix shift tends to occur from quarter-to-quarter. And I know the days claims payable metric is one that's commonly looked at. We don't target or forecast any specific level of DCP rather this is more the output of our detailed assumption setting that's -- then aggregated up to the enterprise level. So, we remain comfortable with our reserving methodology and confidence in the adequacy of the balance sheet.As it relates to stop loss, you're right, we're seeing nice growth in that product line. We've got 13% year-on-year premium growth. We're on track to achieve our target profitability in that business this year. So nice performance, and it continues to resonate with our clients. David, anything you want to add in that regard? David Cordani: Yes. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Justin. The item I amplify is, Justin, as you recall from prior conversations, part of our consultative approach and go-to-market approach is when you work with clients of a variety of sizes around the benefit design that matches their strategy, the clinical programs in support of that, that match your strategy, the service support programs that match your strategy. The final thing we work on is the funding mechanism. And as the market conditions change, we have the ability to flex between risk or guarantee cost, shared returns and/or self-funded with stop loss. And our stop loss program, as you call out, continues to perform well, grow well and resonate in the marketplace because it provides that peace of mind and predictability for employers around their cash flow and any dislocation that may happen in a given year. So, our specialists in that space have a high-performing book. It continues to resonate well. And you'll see ebb and flow over time based on market buying conditions, but continued growth. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to come back to the pharmacy side of the business for a minute and ask a couple of questions. One, when I think about the quarter, can you talk about the margin impact from: one, GLP-1s? I know you talked about strength there; two, the shift to biosimilars?; and three, the Centene implementation costs? Can you just talk about how each of those had an impact on the margin in the quarter? And then, just as a follow-up, when you talked about the 2024 selling season, more specific on the PBM side, can you maybe just give a little more detail as to how renewals went and what your retention rates are expected to be for '24? Thanks. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Lisa. It's Brian. I'll start. I think that's a multiparter, and then Eric is going to chime in with some comments on the sales season. But as it relates to the quarter, overall, Evernorth continues to perform really well. So, I'd start there. Largely in line with our expectations when you put all the different moving pieces together. The individual components you kind of called out there, Eric referenced earlier, GLP-1 utilization does continue to build, which in the Evernorth business is a positive contributor to our earnings at this point in time, whether that be for diabetic indications or non-diabetic indications. So that's certainly a net positive relative to the Evernorth business in 2023. On the biosimilar side of the house, you should think of, thus far, relatively low adoption of Amjevita in the first half of the year. On the second half of the year, we obviously added two additional biosimilars into the National Preferred Formulary. And one of the reasons we expect acceleration in income growth in the third and fourth quarter is the impact of greater biosimilar adoption as well as improved overall positioning relative to the dynamics of competitiveness across the four drugs that will be on the National Preferred Formulary. But in the second quarter, I wouldn't characterize biosimilars as a particular driver of the margin profile. On the Centene impact, we remain very much on track relative to the implementation against our commitments. As we mentioned before, we expect to spend about $200 million over the course of 2023. You should think of that as gradually building quarter-to-quarter over the course of the year. And so, the money is being spent as we speak. And all those factors did impact the second quarter. But again, nothing in particular I would call out being significantly deviating from our expectations compared to what we expected three months ago. Eric, maybe you can pick up both on Centene and the selling season. Eric Palmer: Great. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Lisa. So, just a couple of other comments that I had on Centene. I'm really pleased with how we are working together to deliver an implementation program to serve Centene's customers. We are on track, and there's good momentum in the readiness for our January '24 implementation. So, continue to be excited about that opportunity. With respect to the selling season more broadly, we operate in a competitive market, and the strength of our solutions really continues to resonate. We will deliver another strong retention rate. As we look to the 2024, I think mid-90%-s or higher, and consistent with our prior commentary around what a strong retention rate looks like. We'll have additional new growth, new client wins on top of the large Centene win as well. So, feeling good as we kind of wind down the 2024 selling season at this point, and we'll provide more detail on that when we provide our 2024 guidance later on.Lisa Gill: Great. Thank you. Operator: Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I wanted to get a little more color on the increased enrollment outlook. I guess you've indicated in the past that you're being a little bit concerned about recessions and determinations. Were those -- anything changed there to drive that? Or was it new customer growth? Just a little color. Thanks. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, I'll start, and I think your question is specific to Cigna Healthcare, which is where I'll go. So, first off, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare book. If you look at our year-to-date customer growth, it's running ahead of expectations at $1.5 million net growth, and that builds off of a strong performance we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As it relates to our refreshed membership outlook for the year, you can think of the primary driver of that being an elevated expectation for individual exchange customers by year-end 2023. The other components of the Cigna Healthcare customer outlook are broadly unchanged from our prior projections. We're not yet seeing meaningful signs of any economic pressure within our commercial book of business. But that said, we have assumed some elevated disenrollment in the U.S. commercial business in the second half of 2023 in order to be prudent. We continue to exclude any potential Medicaid redetermination lives from our commercial forecast for the balance of the year. And taken all together, again, pleased to see a full year outlook of 8% growth in total medical customers across Cigna Healthcare. One minor refinement we made this year or this quarter relative to the individual exchange business is, we are now forecasting some level of Medicaid redeterminations coming in through the balance of the year. So, you should think of the commercial business, excluding Medicaid redetermination, the individual forecast now including some level of redeterminations for the balance of the year. Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question. Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Just clarification on the exchange true-ups and the impact there. I just want to make sure I get this right. I assume you've got a bigger payable, but that probably means that your claims costs are coming in a little bit better. So I just want to see if there's actually -- and offset from the receivable from last year. So I just want to see if there's actually an EPS impact expected for this year. And then my real question is, just could you speak to your MA bid strategy for 2024? I'm specifically interested in how you're thinking about benefit design in light of rates and the risk model changes? And then, if there's anything to talk about the VillageMD partnership, if that impacts any way you're bidding in certain markets? Brian Evanko: Good morning, Josh. It's Brian. So, I'll take the first one, and then David will pick up on the Medicare Advantage question. So, as it relates to the different payable dynamics, let me try to give you the full picture here. So, just for some context, we ended the quarter with about 820,000 customers in the individual exchange business. That was up significantly from where we were at the end of 2022. And during the 2022 year, we were in a risk adjustment receivable position on this business. So, when we stepped into '23, we had been anticipating that, that would switch over and that will -- we'd be in a payable position for 2023. The first look we got at the industry-wide risk adjustment data that we received in early July indicated that we'll be in an even greater payable position for the 2023 plan year, and that was driven by two large states. Those two large states represent about half of the individual exchange premium base. And the adjustment in the first half of the year that came through the second quarter was an $80 million increase in the payable. That was offset largely by a favorable true-up on the 2022 receivable. You can think of that in the range of about $50 million. And then the residual is primarily driven by favorable claim costs in 2023 relative to our expectations. So that favorability in the 2023 claim costs partially offset the increased payable that we have -- that ran through the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps to square the picture a little bit on the individual exchange business. David, do you want to pick up on MA? David Cordani: Sure, Brian, thanks. Good morning, Josh. So, you had two questions. Specific to MA and our bid strategy, I'll just speak more broadly. I'm not going to go into detail specifically, Josh, just to manage expectations given the time cycle and the competitive nature. First and foremost, as I noted, we're pleased with our growth in 2023, point one. Two, as we look to 2024 to some of the points you made reference to, we expect to see larger-than-average local market variability in terms of offering and positioning by competitors. And at this point, I would highlight and reinforce that we remain convicted to and comfortable with our bid assumptions relative to underlying medical costs based upon what we've seen through the first two quarters of the year and our outlook for the year. I'd also note that our [stars] (ph) position coming into the cycle is consistent and strong and our early look at the stars on a go-forward basis remains consistent and strong from that standpoint. Specifically to your last point around Village, first and foremost, I'd ask you to think about initiating the relationship with Village, we seek to have a long-term strategic positive impact. I would note that day one for the benefit of our customers who are experiencing Village and Summit relationships, they began to see benefits immediately by the nature of the structure of our relationship. And then, we continue to collaborate, innovate on value-based care, whether it's leveraging some Evernorth capabilities like behavioral, virtual or other services, and/or go more deeply into individual markets around more precisely leveraging data and insights to curate sub-specialty networks to get the best possible quality and cost and affordability. That benefit will continue to mount as we go forward, and to the core of your question, contribute to market by market, our posture in MA. But specifically, we're driving this initiative with Village and with our Evernorth team to benefit our commercial space as well. So, we're pleased with the early traction, a lot of work to do, and it will continue to yield dividends both today and into the future. Thanks, Josh.Josh Raskin: Thank you. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Nathan Rich: Great. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. I wanted to go back to biosimilars. How has the pricing of biosimilar of Humira compared to expectations as more competition come to market? And given what appears to be a very significant reduction in pricing, does that pull forward the benefit from the Humira biosimilar at all? And for the different options that you added to the formulary, should we think of the economics of each of those as being similar to Evernorth? And then, just a quick follow-up on the Cigna Healthcare segment. Brian, could you maybe help us think through the seasonality this year and maybe why that's different than a typical year? And as we think about the 2024 and going forward, do you go back to more normal seasonality in that business? Thank you. Eric Palmer: Good morning, Nathan. It's Eric. I'll start. So, as you noted and implied in your question, biosimilars are a really important opportunity to drive competition and for us to then help to make that competition efficient to drive improvements to the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. Now, in 2023, we've continued to co-prefer Humira on the formulary. Towards the beginning of the year, we added Amjevita to our National Preferred Formulary and recently added Cyltezo and Sandoz's products, both the low and high [indiscernible] versions onto the NPF. So that's the activity that's gotten us to this point to date. I would note, we work through with the manufacturers on the terms of those to drive to the best available cost, the best available expense for our clients. And we have visibility into that pretty early on. So, we've navigated and made our arrangements in constructing the placement such as we came into this year. And so, I wouldn't want you to think about there being dynamics kind of playing out simultaneously. These are things we have negotiated in advance. We have visibility into as the products come into the market and we work to leverage the competition to continue to improve affordability for the benefit of the clients we serve. Over time, as we drive even more products, more competition, we'll work to continue to bring improved levels of affordability to our clients and continue to construct our offerings in a way that best meet their needs. I hand it over to Brian on the second part of your question. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Nathan. It's Brian. So, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare seasonality, I'd start -- just to remind you, we expect the second half earnings to be a little bit less than 55% in the third quarter. Relative to the MCR component of that, our prior expectations on the MCR seasonality have not changed. So, what I mean by that is the directional pattern we saw, for example, in 2022 on MCR is a reasonable proxy for what we'd expect the 2023 quarterly pattern to be, and as a result, the fourth quarter MCR is likely to be the highest quarter of the year as we see more customers meet their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum obligations. However, we do expect the pace of SG&amp;A spending to look different than it did last year. For example, we had a step up in SG&amp;A in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter of '23. The other item that I call your attention to is our net investment income in the fourth quarter of '22 was considerably weaker than what we're expecting to see in the fourth quarter of '23. So, those are the primary things to think through as it relates to the seasonality pattern. As it relates to '24. At this point in time, there's nothing I'd call your attention to that will lead us to think there's any abnormal pattern. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Steven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess to the extent that your Medicare Advantage book is seeing a more normalized utilization trend this year that you baked into your pricing and guidance, just curious if you have any additional color just for the second quarter and whether it normalized more in the outpatient setting versus inpatient. I just want to hear a little more color on some of the trends by cost category, just given how topical this is for the industry this quarter. Thanks. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, as you noted, we planned and priced for more normalized utilization levels in 2023, and our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation. So, within the MA book specifically to the core of your question, we have seen elevated utilization of both outpatient and professional services all year. But important this should be viewed in the context of what we had forecasted and priced for. So, the overall cost trends are largely in line with our expectations in both our second half 2023 guidance and our 2024 bids. Anticipate that, that dynamic will continue, as it relates to specifically within outpatient and professional surgeries are the area that I'd call your attention to, in particular, orthopedic and cardiovascular, we did see some level of favorability in inpatients. So those are a few of the subcategories that I'd call your attention to, but all in line with what we had anticipated coming into the year. Steven Valiquette: Okay. That's perfect. Thanks. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Stephen Baxter: Yeah, hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about some of the moving parts in the P&amp;L this year for Evernorth. In the first half, there's a pretty notable divergence in the growth of revenue and gross profit. And then, what you've seen dropped through to earnings. I know that Centene is a big part of that and the investments you're making there. But the trend underneath that still feels like it's pretty notable. Any additional color on what's going on within Evernorth SG&amp;A would be helpful. Whether that's investments or mix or anything else that we should be keeping in mind? Thanks.Brian Evanko: Hey, Steve, it's Brian. So, a few things I'd call your attention to in regards to the profitability margins relative to revenue. We had an expansion of our relationship with the Department of Defense that was effective on January 1, and we had some additional spending that we're kind of working our way into in terms of growing into that. So that certainly weighed down the income growth a bit in the first half of the year. To your point, the rate and pace of investments, particularly around the accelerated growth businesses in Evernorth, both the healthcare services as well as the Accredo specialty pharmacy also impacted the income growth. And then for the back half of the year, we expect accelerated income growth, again, mid-single digits in the third quarter, mid- to high-single digits in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the increased ramp for biosimilars. And I would note that, that's not predicated on any meaningful share shift. We have strong visibility to that income emerging in the back half of the year. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question. John Ransom, your line is open. You may ask your question. Seems like he is not responding. We'll go ahead to Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Your line is open. George Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I know it's a small piece of the business, but the other revenue inside of Evernorth grew 35% this quarter, accelerating actually versus the prior quarter. I guess it's becoming, to some degree, a meaningful portion of the segment. I guess, could you talk about what's driving that growth? And how should we think about the margin profile that's attached to that business? Brian Evanko: Good morning, George. It's Brian. I'll start and then Eric can pick up a bit. So yes, the fees and other revenue in Evernorth is a strong driver of growth, granted off of a low base. So, important to keep that in mind as you think about the overall P&amp;L. Multiple areas of growth underneath this line. One I'd call out is we're seeing increased demand for PBM service-based solutions, meaning more fee-oriented relationships as we have more and more clients looking for those types of mechanisms. We also have contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses reflected here. So, for example, MDLive and eviCore are both contributing to that. And then if you're looking at pharmacy other revenue, the CuraScript Specialty Distribution business has been a strong grower year-on-year. You also recall from some of our prior conversations that we're very focused on driving cross-enterprise leverage between the Cigna Healthcare business and Evernorth. So, as Cigna Healthcare procures more and more services from Evernorth, we have some benefit that comes through the fees and the other revenue lines in Evernorth from that as well. So, Eric, anything you want to add in terms of further color? Eric Palmer: Brian, thanks. You've hit the headlines in terms of the main drivers here financially. Well, just to note, on the fee-based portion of the PBM in particular, this is an area that we've continued to accelerate. David made reference in his prepared remarks around our ClearCareRx program. This builds off of a couple of years of experience that we've got in providing fee-based fully-aligned mechanisms in terms of providing the pharmacy benefit, and so those fee types of arrangements will come through there. I would say, have you think about the margin profile for that business is very consistent with the other businesses in Express Scripts and the like. And then likewise, the growth in our MDLive and behavioral platforms continue to be an area of real focus for us and continued momentum into that driver as well. And I would have you think about those margins is also generally in line with the Evernorth segment overall. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity and the momentum that we're building in all of the different lines across the Evernorth portfolio, and you're seeing the growth there come through that line. George Hill: Thank you.Operator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our last question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Lance Wilkes: Great. Thanks. A question on the specialty products in the Healthcare segment. And just had kind of three elements to it. One was, what sort of utilization trends you were seeing in behavioral, dental and some of the other areas where you're taking some risk? And then a broader question, just understanding, how much specialty is contributing to the earnings power of the business versus just the core medical? And what do you think the cross-sell opportunities might still remain for that business? Thanks. Brian Evanko: Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. I'll start, and then David, if you want to chime in with anything, feel free. So, for a long period of time, as I think you know, our specialty products within Cigna Healthcare been a really core part of the value proposition as we seek to expand client relationships. So, we have few clients that only purchase medical services from us more and more purchase a full suite because we've demonstrated over time our clinical models perform best when we have a fuller suite of services. As it relates to what we're seeing in terms of trends in terms of utilization, behavioral health has certainly been growing at a strong clip, not just this year, but for the past few years. Part of that is by design as we engage with our customers. And over time, that's a good thing because the more utilization we see in behavioral health services, it helps to defray core medical costs over time. We've also seen an uptick in dental utilization this year as well, but all of these things are within, again, the boundaries of what we had forecasted and planned for and priced for within our Cigna Healthcare book of business, which is why you're seeing our commercial employer business continue to perform so well financially. And again, that line is on track to achieve target margins here in 2023. David, anything you want to pick up on here? David Cordani: Sure, Brian. Thanks. Good morning, Lance. A few items to highlight, specifically, just click down a little more notch, in behavioral, as Brian noted, elevated trend and as you would expect, and over a prolonged period of time, I think the last three to five years, as you click down in it, think about the professional services as such, we continue to innovate new products, new programs, expansion of network, both physical network, we operate the largest virtual behavioral network in America today, and then expanding behavioral services even further in our value-based care programs to help medical professionals be a first line of screening and support from that standpoint. To the last part of your question around the expansion opportunities within our portfolio, you know our portfolio well in terms of the healthcare side of the equation. If you think about the old monikers of Select, I think under 500 employees, middle market, 500 to 5,000 old monikers, and Nashville above 5,000, multi-geographic. Select, you still think about that as totally cross-sold and penetrated. We go to market with bundled solutions. It's a big part of our value proposition. Helps us generate a predictable high quality, low trend and outcome. Middle market remains and has a high level of penetration, yet there are cross-sell opportunities. And national accounts, a lower level of penetration versus the other segments. However, as I noted to A.J.'s question, the point solution fatigue in the marketplace presents it even further opportunity as you coordinate those services. The last note I would make is as we leverage the breadth of the Evernorth capabilities today and into the future, we're innovating new solutions. So, you'll hear us talk more about [path wall] (ph) programs to take specific diagnoses and look at reengineering those episodes of care end-to-end. And in cases to your phraseology, we take risk based on the performance, we hold ourself accountable based upon the clinical service and financial outcomes. So, strong penetration down market, opportunities upmarket, market buying behavior is evolving because of point solution fatigue, and importantly, continued innovation will continue to drive growth for us there. Thanks, Lance. Operator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. David Cordani: Thank you for your engagement and questions today. I just want to highlight a few items. We stepped into 2023 with strong growth and have been successful in building beyond that momentum throughout the first half of the year. We remain confident that we'll deliver on our commitments, including our adjusted EPS outlook for 2023 of at least $24.70 and our commitment for at least $28.00 of EPS in 2024. I'd also know how proud and appreciative I am of our colleagues around the world who continue to be dedicated to driving innovation and delivering on the programs and solutions, as well as partnerships that support every day the health and vitality of our customers, our patients and our clients. As always, we look forward to talking to you again soon about how we're working to sustain the growth of our company and capture more opportunities to serve more lives and achieve a greater impact, and we continue to invest in our future every day to drive further innovation. Have a great day. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna Group's second quarter 2023 results review.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma takes a look at the marketing campaigns organized by leading global brands, such as Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY), and Coca-Cola (KO). As pay disparity remains a major issue in women's professional sports, DiPalma compares the differences in broadcasting deals between the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and Major League Soccer (MLS).Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]AKIKO FUJITA: The Women's World Cup is setting viewership records. And as the hype around women's soccer grows, advertisers are eager to score airtime. Ad revenue for the 2023 Women's World Cup is up 50% from the last event in 2019.That's according to Mike Petruzzi, Senior VP of sales for Fox Sports. With more on that, let's bring in Brooke DiPalma, who's been looking at some of those numbers for us. Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning, Akiko. With the game still underway, it'll be quite some time until we get a full-picture view of just how much money companies spend to see their ads on the big screen. But if you take a look back at 2019, when the US won the World Cup, by the way, $96 million were spent on ads. Yet a year before that, in 2018, $350 million were spent for ads during the men's World Cup.But the hype is growing around the women's game. Six big names are vying for airtime during this year's tournament. Adidas launched its ad called ""Play Until They Can't Look Away."" Where it highlighted the next generation of players. It's global comms director said, ""this summer's tournament feels like it's one that's really bringing us to a tipping point for the women's game. Record ticket sales, bigger broadcast audience, more committed fandoms and more emerging icons.""Coca-Cola has supported the event since the tournament began back in 1991, but this year may be a bit different. It decided to build on that relationship with its ad called ""Believing in Magic,"" showing the stars of the Women's World Cup as young players, and Nike showing a son and daughter watching the 1999 games, only to be propelled into an entirely different world today, where women's soccer has a new energy around the game. The similar theme in all these commercials are reinvigoration around the women's game of soccer, in which turn, perhaps, could lead to more money, Akiko.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: So Brooke, what could spur more money for ads?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well, when I spoke to Paul Verner, an analyst at Insider Intelligence at eMarketer, he said, quote, ""it's going to be gradual process. But one moment that could change a lot here is the woman's broadcasting rights that are up for renegotiation and back in 2020, when the media rights for the National Women's Soccer League went up for $1.5 million per year in an agreement with CBS spanning a three-year period."" But if you take that and compare it to the $250 million Apple recently spent for men's Major League Soccer, that recently secured a deal spanning the next decade, that's about 160 times more than that woman's deal that I just mentioned.And Verner says that he thinks the gap will start to close as we see this broadcast deal gets renegotiated rather. But he said it will be a very, very long way to go. But higher pay for these broadcast deals could lead to higher sponsorships, higher ad value and ultimately, women, at the end of the day, getting paid more.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, chipping away at that existing divide. Brooke DiPalma, thanks so much for that.]"

Angela Ruggiero, Sports Innovation Lab Co-Founder and CEO, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss her experience as a female athlete and Sports Innovation Lab's mission to increase investments in women's sports.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, there is no doubt the world's most recognizable brands have a big role to play when discussing equality in women sport. The likes of Nike and Adidas are seen as pivotal in elevating the status of some of the world's top female athletes. Now, much of the growth potential just needs to be quantified. Enter four-time Olympian and gold medal-winning ice hockey star Angela Ruggiero for Sports Innovation Lab looks to leverage the power of fan data to help all the stakeholders around women's sports boost investment in the space. Angela joins us now.Great to talk to you today. Let me first talk about your experience as an athlete. What did you experience there that informed this path to found this company or the lab?ANGELA RUGGIERO: Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. I played in four Olympics. I obviously knew there was an avid fan base that would follow me around. This is-- I retired in 2011, before digital media really took off. But I saw the avidity of these fans that wanting more access to me as an athlete. And over the last 10 years of really seeing how the digital transformation of sport in particular and the adoption and awareness that we don't do enough to invest in women has created an enormous opportunity in the market to grow women's sports.So started the company really, saying could we bring more data to the ecosystem? And let's objectively look at women's sports through that lens and show there's a real business case, as opposed to what I've heard time and time again, oh, it's a charity, it's a nice thing to do. We said at Sports Innovation Lab, let's actually drive dollars into the ecosystem by bringing the data. And that's what we've been able to do in the last few years.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: And on that front, we saw the Sports Innovation Lab announced this coalition earlier this year, that essentially brings a lot of the big brands and media together to increase investments into women's sports. What did you hear from some of these brands, these companies about why they've held back some of those investment?ANGELA RUGGIERO: Well, I think a lot of them increasingly is-- particularly more women, which I think is a big deal at the helm. Andrea Brimmer, for example, at Ally, the CMO there, pledged 50% of her marketing budget to women's sports. There wasn't enough inventory. And what I mean by that is when you go to broadcast networks, some of them haven't bought the women's rights. Or they've been bundled with the men's rights. So it's been actually hard for those brands that want to spend more money. Think Google. Think Coca-Cola. There isn't enough product that they can actually buy. Because, again, historically meteorites have been bundled with the men, or there just isn't the same opportunity.But what I'm seeing is, again, a lot of these companies are saying this is the right thing to do, but it's actually really good for our business, our bottom line. And so this club, the women's sports club that we founded with Ally was to hopefully drive more investment, drive more awareness, and to work through some of the ecosystem problems that exist so that we can support one another as these brands increasingly want to spend more money. And do it in the right ways. It just-- there's a little bit more heavier lifting.And I think a big part of that is you might have a smaller sample size today in terms of the reach that you can create in this market. But through investment, again, we're seeing an enormous amount of change. The momentum score that we found, 40%, compared to the general sports fan, the women's market drives. So you have a market that is outpacing the men in terms of driving growth, retaining their fan base. And you see brands paying attention and saying, let me spend more money in this system.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, it feels like one of the big changes in driving that momentum has been the real estate that's out there. And you mentioned social media as one, just the digital landscape. There's a lot more places for female athletes to get the word out, to show their game. I mean, can you talk about how that has driven visibility? And more importantly, if we're talking about dollars, how does that translate into ads and sponsorships?ANGELA RUGGIERO: Yeah, I think you nailed it on the head. Athletes have the ability to go direct to consumer now because of social media. And increasingly, the long tail of the sports ecosystem, these challenger leagues like the NWSL or even the WNBA, now don't just have to go through the broadcast networks where they usually don't get prime time. So they're able to go direct to consumers through digital channels, through the athletes themselves who are driving a lot of the awareness and visibility. Think Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan.So there's new ways that fans can engage. That's what we talk about every day at Sports Innovation Lab. This fluid fan wants to connect to the athlete, understand more than just the game. They want behind the scenes. They want storytelling. And women's sports is very good at that. Women athletes are very good at that. And so technology has now enabled this ecosystem to grow rapidly and in some ways surpass some of the men's ecosystems that, again, are doing well top-line. But they don't have the nimbleness that you see in the women's ecosystem. So athletes are entertainers.Female athletes tend to share more-- be more connected to their consumer. They recognize they probably make more money off the field than on the field. So there's an incentive for them to do that as well. But that again creates organic genuine relationships that the brands want to be a part of. They know that their brand has to connect to athletes and women's sports leagues. And again, athletes, I think, in this space are leading the way on that.AKIKO FUJITA: What are the biggest opportunities for monetization? Is it in women's soccer? Is it in women's basketball? What are you seeing?ANGELA RUGGIERO: Yeah, I would say-- I mean, look at the NWSL. We're talking about the World Cup right now. They went from a $2 million expansion fee a couple years ago to $53 million today. Sixth Street, a big private equity firm, just bought the rights to the Bay expansion team and others. So you see a rapid increase in what sophisticated investors now want to buy women's sports assets for. You're seeing the same thing. The WNBA raised $75 million a couple of years ago.You see, I'd say basketball and soccer here in the US market growing increasingly. And our report-- recent report Fanarchy26, about a quarter of the US market wants soccer, played soccer. So again, that's a global sport but I think increasingly has an opportunity here in the US. My sport, hockey, of course, I would love to see more growth. And there's softball, volleyball. There's a lot of sports that, again, have been underinvested, haven't had the same visibility as, say, tennis or soccer.But the point of it is fans want more. They want more access. They want to consume. And this isn't just female sports fans. This is men and women saying, give me great content, but deliver it to me in a way that I consume today, this fluid fan. And they're-- in some ways, they don't care about gender. They just want really cool action with great athletes that are providing an entertaining ecosystem for them, and they'll invest. The fan will invest. The brands will invest. And now, you're seeing increasingly the media side of the market say, these rights are worth something so we're going to invest as well.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, nice to see those rights being made. Angela Ruggiero, Sports Innovation Lab co-founder and CEO. Thanks so much.]"

VF Corp, which traces its roots back to 1899, has grown through multiple acquisitions.The company's stock is currently trading at $19.76 per share, giving it a market cap of $7.7 billion. However, the GF Value, an estimation of the stock's fair value, stands at $66.82, indicating a potential value trap.Evaluating VF Corp (VFC): A Potential Value Trap?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed using historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value.For VF Corp, the GF Value suggests a possible value trap scenario. This estimate is derived from historical multiples at which the stock has traded, the company's past growth, and future business performance estimates. If a stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is deemed overvalued and likely to deliver poor future returns. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future returns are expected to be higher.Story continuesEvaluating VF Corp (VFC): A Potential Value Trap?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength AnalysisInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. It is essential to review a company's financial strength before deciding to invest. Key indicators such as the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage provide valuable insights. VF Corp has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.1, which is worse than 77.59% of companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. The overall financial strength of VF Corp is ranked at 4 out of 10, indicating poor financial health.Evaluating VF Corp (VFC): A Potential Value Trap?Profitability and GrowthConsistent profitability over the long term reduces investment risk.

However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -23.1%, which ranks worse than 89.52% of companies in the industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability.

WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. For the past 12 months, VF Corp's ROIC stands at 24.95, and its WACC is 7.76, suggesting that the company is creating value for shareholders.Evaluating VF Corp (VFC): A Potential Value Trap?Identifying a Possible Value TrapDespite VF Corp's low valuation, certain indicators suggest it might be a value trap. With a Piotroski F-score of only 2 out of a possible 9, potential concerns arise. This low score may signal a downward trend in critical aspects such as profitability, funding, and efficiency.

However, the drop has sufficiently priced in the risks, offering investors an attractive entry point.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL. Click here to check it out. PYPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PYPLPayPal Is at an Attractive Entry PointEarnings updatePayPal reported $7.29 billion in revenue for the second quarter, an increase of 7% year over year and exceeding analysts' estimates by $30 million. As a result, adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $1.16. The $377 billion total payment volume, which increased 11% annually, was also a major contributor to the results. Growth for Venmo was a little slower than average with $67 billion in TPV, gaining 8%.Additionally, operating cash flow was -$200 million, down from $1.25 billion in the prior-year quarter. However, operating cash flow was $1.70 billion when adjusting for changes in working capital, the origination of loans that are being held for sale and profits from repayments of these loans receivable.The sharp increase in PayPal's low-margin business goods is what caused its operating margin to fall. The company's margins have been under pressure for several quarter despite the success of these items, which have lesser profitability. Simultaneously, due in part to rising competition from rivals like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), growth in its higher-margin products has slowed. Specifically, PayPal's adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.4%, which fell short of the company's own forecast of 22% and was down from 22.7% in the first quarter. This shortfall disappointed investors and analysts who were expecting better results.Story continuesThe San Jose, California-based fintech company also recorded a sequential decline in its user base. With 431 million users on its platform at the end of the second quarter, PayPal recorded a 2 million reduction from the end of the first quarter. This also marked the second straight quarter of decreases. However, the number of transactions per account increased to 54.7, up 12% from the previous year, offsetting the slight drop in the number of active accounts.PayPal Is at an Attractive Entry PointSource: PayPalFinally, according to management, the company's strategic investment portfolio had a 34-cent impact on the preceding year. Without that effect, analysts anticipate a 43% increase in earnings per share. PayPal has been affected by the macroeconomic environment and adverse currency exchange rates, so investors were hoping that its growth would pick up again.What to expect in the third quarterPayPal anticipates net revenue of $7.4 billion for the third quarter, up about 8% year over year, translating to non-GAAP earnings of $1.23 per share, up almost 14%.Despite the drop in margins, acting Chief Financial Officer Gabrielle Rabinovitch said during the earnings call that PayPal expects an improvement in margin performance toward the end of the year. This projection might be based on factors like expected changes in business strategies, cost management and the anticipated rebound in e-commerce growth as inflation cools down.ValuationAs a result of its recent performance, the stock remains undervalued. The company is currently trading at just 2 times next year's sales, which is close to its lowest valuation ever.Further, the GF Value Line suggests the stock is significanlty undervalued currently based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.PayPal Is at an Attractive Entry PointThe shares have not gained nearly as much from the recent market rally as some of its fintech peers, but it is still well below its pandemic-era highs. As a result, PayPal might be a great option for investors looking for a long-term play, even though it may no longer be the exciting growth story it once was.TakeawayDespite PayPal's challenges, the stock remains undervalued and presents an attractive entry point for investors. From a technical standpoint, it makes sense to anticipate a modest rebound given the steep share price decrease following the second-quarter results. Trading at just 2 times next year's sale the company's potential for a comeback makes it an appealing option for patient investors.As its products improve, more businesses are likely to start using PayPal as a payment option, which will significantly boost total payment volume and income as the economy strengthens. The company will also likely profit from the rising transition to electronic payment methods as its network effect will attract additional users and merchants, further solidifying its market position.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Accenture plc ACN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Fed Appears Open to More Rate HikesThe Fed resumed its interest rate hike in July after a brief pause in June. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points on Jul 26 to take the federal funds rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%, the highest in more than 22 years. The Fed has been on a rate-hiking spree and has so far increased it by 525 basis points on 11 occasions since March 2022.Cryptocurrencies have had a solid run this year after a disappointing 2022. Last year's unimpressive show by cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, was primarily because of the Fed's decision to adopt an aggressive interest rate hike policy to curb multi-decade high inflation.The Fed's decision is finally bearing fruit as inflation has steadily declined over the past 12 months. However, cryptocurrencies are inversely related to market interest rates. The Fed has continued with its rate hikes this year before briefly pausing in June. However, cryptocurrencies rebounded from their 2022 lows and have continued their northward journey.Slowing inflation had raised hopes that the Fed could soon end its current monetary tightening cycle but it hiked interest rates in July and remained open to more hikes depending on economic data.Following the Fed's July rate hike announcement, prices of all major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum, fell. Bitcoin, particularly, has suffered the most since the Fed's recent rate hike.Bitcoin had a solid run in July, hitting $31,500 earlier in the month, and hovered mostly around the $30,000 mark. However, it was trading at $29,126 on Aug 2. The crypto market could face more volatility in the coming days as the central bank remains open for additional interest rate hikes.Story continuesInvestors should thus adopt a buy-on-the-dip strategy when dealing with cryptocurrencies. Each dip in crypto prices presents an opportunity to accumulate digital assets, as this approach may lead to significant gains once the Fed puts an end to its aggressive monetary control policy.Our ChoicesPayPal Holdings, Inc. provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

Susan, please go ahead whenever you are ready.Susan Pasley Keppelman HarcourtThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.Story continuesAndres Ricardo Gluski WeilertGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 financial review call. .Today, I will discuss our second quarter results as well as the excellent progress we're making towards our financial and strategic objectives. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give some more detail on our financial performance and outlook. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $607 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. Results for the quarter as well as for the first half of the year are very much in line with our expectations. Thus, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance for all metrics and our targeted annualized growth rate through 2027. As we noted earlier this year, approximately 75% of our 2023 earnings will come in the second half of the year. Now for an update on our strategic priorities. At the core of our strategy is a focus on, first, new renewables with the target to triple our installed capacity by 2027. Second, growth at our U.S. utilities, where we expect to increase the rate base by more than 10% per year through 2027. And third, the transformation of our portfolio as we exit coal by the end of 2025 and invest in the new technologies that will define our industry for years to come. Today, I will provide an update on how we are executing across each of these focus areas, beginning with our renewables on Slide 4. We continue to see significant inbound interest from key customers wanting to do large U.S.-based renewable projects with us. We believe this reflects both our reputation for consistently delivering on time as well as our best-in-class ability to tailor projects to the specific needs of our customers. Year-to-date, we have now signed 2.2 gigawatts of new PPAs, including 2.1 gigawatts since our Investor Day in May. These numbers do not include 1 gigawatt from Belllefield second phase or 1.4 gigawatts from our green hydrogen project with Air Products in Texas, both of which could be signed before the year's end. I feel good about the likelihood that we will sign 5 to 6 gigawatts of new PPAs this year. We continue to be globally the #1 seller of renewable energy to corporate customers. We also had a leading position in the U.S., providing renewable energy to data centers, which are seeing explosive growth in part as a result of the generative AI revolution. Turning to Slide 5. Another area of recent success is how we have been working with technology customers to complete projects initiated by other developers. Our corporate customers want us to take on these projects because they know we will deliver them on time and can also restructure the original PPAs to provide customized solutions. Two great recent examples of this are the 185-megawatt Delta wind project in Mississippi which has a signed PPA with Amazon and the 2 gigawatt Bellefield project in California, 1 gigawatt of which has a signed PPA with a large technology company that is a repeat customers. Both of these projects demonstrate the strength of the relationships we have with our customers. For us, completing other developers' projects is especially attractive because we can get similar returns to greenfield projects while preserving our current pipeline for future projects. Our 61 gigawatt pipeline represents investments in land, interconnection and development which must be replaced once utilized. Given growing constraints on new transmission in markets like California and PJM, having the flexibility to decide when to utilize these resources helps us maximize total returns from our renewables business. Moving on to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of projects with signed long-term contracts of 13.2 gigawatts, which is the largest in AES's history. I would like to reiterate once more that our definition of backlog includes only signed contracts for which we have an obligation to deliver and our customers have an obligation to take a given amount of renewable energy for a given amount of time. The average tenure of the contracts in our backlog is 19 years, and currently, 41% of our 13.2 backlog is already under construction, and 74% is slated to come online within the next 3 years. Turning to Slide 7. Since our Investor Day in May, we have completed a number of landmark projects. In June, we announced the commercial operation of the 238-megawatt Phase 1 of the Chevelon Butte wind project in Arizona. It is one of the first projects in the country to be placed in service to qualify for the 10% additional energy community tax credit bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act. And once Phase 2 is completed, it will reach 454 megawatts and be the largest wind project in the state. In addition, we completed the Andes II B solar-plus storage project in Chile for our copper mining customers. Its 180 megawatts of solar plus 560-megawatt hours of storage will make it the largest battery storage installation in all of Latin America. We were also able to use 5B prefabricated solar panels for a portion of the project, which advances the learning and lowers the cost of future developments. Turning to Slide 8. We are on track to complete the 3.4 gigawatts of new renewable projects we committed to earlier this year, including nearly 800 megawatts we've already brought online. In the U.S., we expect to commission roughly 2.1 watts which is roughly double the capacity we installed last year. I am very proud of the work our teams have done to ensure that we have had no supply chain or construction delays. All of the necessary equipment has been contracted for our 2023 through 2025 backlog. There remains the potential for completion of up to an additional 600 megawatts this year in the U.S. given the strong performance of our construction program. We see our record of completing projects on time as a key competitive advantage that is highly valued by our customers. We are one of the only major developers that did not abandon or meaningfully delay construction projects over the last 2 years due to supply chain issues. Furthermore, due to our emphasis on long-term planning and strong contractual agreements, we have maintained our project margins despite inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. Now moving to our second priority of utility growth on Slide 9. We remain on track to grow our U.S. pretax contribution at an annualized rate of 17% to 20% through 2027. At AES Ohio, we expect to receive commission approval for our new electric security plan or ESP 4 by the end of August, at which point our new distribution rates would go into immediate effect. As a reminder, ESP 4 includes approval of timely recovery of $500 million in grid modernization over the next 3 years, carrying a 10% return on equity. This will allow us to accelerate investments to continue to improve the quality of service while maintaining the most competitive rates in Ohio. At AES Indiana, we filed for a new rate case in June, the first rate case since 2018. The proposed new rates are designed to recover inflationary impacts since the last case as well as investments in reliability, resiliency improvements and system upgrades. We expect commission approval by the middle of next year. Even after this proposed increase, we still expect our residential rates to be among the lowest in the state. At AES Indiana, we continue to advance our low carbon generation growth plan. We recently filed for approval to build a 200-megawatt or 800-megawatt hour storage facility at the site of the retiring Petersburg coal plant. This project is expected to come online by the end of next year, at which point it will be the largest battery storage project in the Midwest. Now turning to Slide 10 and our third priority of transforming our portfolio by exiting coal generation by the end of 2025. Since our Investor Day in May, we have significantly advanced our decarbonization objective by assuring the retirement of an additional 900 megawatts of coal generation. In June, we retired 415 megawatts of coal as we shut down Unit 2 of the Petersburg plant at AES Indiana. We also announced the retirement of the 276-megawatt Norgener plant in Chile by 2025. Additionally, we received final approval, allowing for the termination of the PPA at our 205-megawatt Warrior Run plant in Maryland for proceeds of $357 million. Now turning to Slide 11. We have expanded our leadership in the development and application of new technologies in our sector. We see this as another important competitive advantage. A new example is the use of embedded artificial intelligence, including generative AI across our operations. This year, we already expect more than $200 million of our adjusted EBITDA to be enabled by AI through both cost reductions and revenue enhancement. We have incorporated AI and data analytics across our operations from areas such as wind, production forecasting to vegetation management to identification of isolated solar panel failures. As part of this program, we also continue to pioneer and advance the use of robotics to install and maintain solar panels. Through our solar robotics program, we are developing proprietary AI-based computer vision to install a wide variety of solar modules, including the largest and heaviest models. With this technology, we plan to install projects significantly faster and across a wide range of working conditions, including extreme heat. In the coming months, we will be validating this technology for the installation of tens of megawatts and expect to move to use it for full scale solar projects in 2024. Finally, we're consolidating our lead in advanced green hydrogen projects with committed off-takers. We are currently developing the largest announced green hydrogen project in the U.S. jointly with Air Products in Texas. It features 1.4 gigawatts of inside defense, hourly matched renewables, 200 metric tons of hydrogen per day and a 30-year take-or-pay contract. It is expected to come online in 2027. Our pipeline of advanced green hydrogen projects is equivalent to more than 6 gigawatts of renewables and 800 metric tons of hydrogen per day. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.Stephen CoughlinThank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results, 2023 parent capital allocation and 2023 guidance. Turning to our financial results for the quarter, beginning on Slide 13. I'm pleased to share that the second quarter was fully in line with our expectations, keeping us well on track to achieve our full year guidance. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $607 million versus $722 million last year, driven primarily by lower margins at AES Andes and higher costs at our renewables SBU due to an accelerated growth plan, but partially offset by new renewables coming online and higher availability at select thermal businesses. Tax attributes earned by our U.S. renewables projects were relatively flat at $38 million in the second quarter of this year, in line with our expectations. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EPS was $0.21 versus $0.34 last year. In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we saw higher parent interest expense this quarter. As a reminder, our year-to-date EPS is fully in line with the breakdown that we outlined earlier this year, in which we noted that roughly 25% of our earnings would come in the first half of the year and 75% in the second half. I'll cover the performance of our strategic business units or SBUs in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 15. In the renewables SBU, we continue to execute on our strategic priority to triple our portfolio by 2027. For the second quarter, as expected, we saw higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes driven primarily by higher wind generation and new projects coming online, partially offset by higher business development and fixed costs due to our accelerated growth plan. At our utilities SBU, we saw higher adjusted PTC driven by lower maintenance expenses, but partially offset by higher interest expense from new debt. We continue to expect strong utilities earnings for the second half of the year driven by typical second half demand seasonality and the pending August decision on ESP 4 at AES, Ohio. With this pending decision and the great progress in renewables growth at AES Indiana, we are continuing to pursue our strategic priority to increase rate base by an average of 10% annually through 2027. Lower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU, primarily reflects lower margins at AES Andes in line with our phase out of coal, partially offset by higher availability at select thermal units. As we execute -- our third strategic priority to exit coal and complete the transformation of our portfolio, although not every quarter, we generally expect to see annual year-over-year declines in energy infrastructure as we discussed at Investor Day in May. Finally, at our new energy technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects continued improved profit margins at Fluence. Fluence has shown year-over-year improvement for 3 straight quarters, and we are very pleased with the strong results they are delivering this year. Now to Slide 19. We are on track to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including growth at our U.S. utilities and contributions from new renewables projects coming online. As a reminder, the 3.4 gigawatts of new renewables we expect to add this year represents an increase of over 75% compared to the 1.9 gigawatts we added to our portfolio last year. This amount also represents a doubling of new renewables in the U.S. versus 2022. This growth will be offset by approximately $200 million of LNG sales we've recorded primarily in the third quarter last year, which we do not expect to recur this year. In addition to our adjusted EBITDA, we expect to realize $500 million to $560 million of tax attributes in 2023, bringing our total adjusted EBITDA plus tax attributes to $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion for the year. Turning to Slide 20. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. As a reminder, we expect our adjusted EPS to be heavily fourth quarter weighted due to the late year seasonality of our U.S. renewable project commissioning. Now to our 2023 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 21. Sources reflect approximately $2.4 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1 billion of parent free cash flow, $400 million to $600 million of asset sales and a $900 million parent debt issuance we completed in Q2. For more information on our debt issuances at the parent company and our subsidiaries, please refer to the appendix of the presentation. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital remains largely in line with guidance, with higher parent investment reflecting our recent acquisition of the 2-gigawatt Bellefield project in the U.S. At our Investor Day in May, we outlined our capital allocation plan through 2027, including asset sales, along with debt and potential future equity issuances. We appreciate all of the feedback we've received, and I want to take a moment to clarify that we will only raise and invest capital in a way that's value accretive to our shareholders. Any potential future equity issuances would have to yield accretive value to shareholders for us to pursue equity as a source of capital. We are also committed to improving our credit profile over time and further bolstering our investment grade rating. We have a number of other levers to pull to support our growth such as increased capital recycling through asset sales and sell-downs. Given our strong asset sales track record and recent success, it is possible that any future equity issuances could be materially lower than the 5-year figure we previously shared. As always, our Investor Relations team is happy to take additional feedback and to follow up on additional questions or data requests. In summary, we're continuing to make progress on transforming AES's portfolio while delivering strong growth in adjusted EBITDA, earnings and parent free cash flow. Our businesses are executing successfully and delivering on their commitments. We will continue to allocate our capital towards our high-growth renewables and utilities to maximize shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertThank you, Steve. .In summary, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance for all metrics and our targeted annualized growth rates through 2027. We continue to make substantial progress on our strategic priorities, including tripling our installed renewables capacity by 2027, increasing the rate base at our U.S. utilities by more than 10% per year through 2027 and transforming our portfolio by exiting coal by the end of 2025, while investing in new technologies. We are delivering on all the commitments we made on our Q4 2022 earnings call and at our Investor Day presentation. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraAndres, just you're now -- if I heard you correctly in your remarks -- are targeting 5 to 6 gigawatts of new PPAs first. Can you confirm whether that is accurate because that's higher than what kind of you might have locked down in previous years? And then what's driving that higher range?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertSure, Durgesh. Good to talk to you. Look, we signed 5.2 gigawatts of new PPAs last year. So what we're seeing this year is we already have 2.2 signed. We have visibility into just 2 projects, which would be another about 2.4, right? Which would put us at 4.4. And of course, we have other projects in the pipeline. So we're not really setting out an official target, but I'm saying that we believe that we should be similar to last year. And we do have a couple of what I call these whales, these 1 gigawatt plus targets, but we feel very good because we see a lot of demand for our products. We have people coming to us with products. So it's really looking at how do we best allocate our money where we get the highest returns and best allocate our teams.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And then maybe when could we get clarity on the potential 600 megawatts in terms of timing. Is that really sort of a Q3 call event when we would know more? How should we think about that? I'm just thinking about the projects that got pushed into 2024, yes.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertSure. Look, I would say that we feel very good about our construction program. So -- versus -- this was the big challenge of this year to grow our construction program in the U.S. by 100%. We feel very good about it. Unfortunately, a lot of these are slated to be commissioned towards the latter part of the year. So we should have a good view in -- on the Q3 call of where we stand, and whether we're going to do more of these projects this year. But in general, we're very pleased with the supply chain, with our construction teams. The team has really stepped up to the task, and I'm very proud of them.Durgesh ChopraExcellent. And then just one last one for me. Steve, you mentioned that the equity needs could be materially reduced. It's nice to hear that in your prepared remarks. Maybe just can you give us more color when could we get an update on timing? What are you thinking just the current equity needs, when in the plan are those scheduled to hit? And just when could we get an update?Stephen CoughlinYes. Look, I mean, as I said in my remarks, Durgesh, this is just a function of multiple levers. And we're seeing a lot of great progress on our asset sale program and the $3 billion that we put out at Investor Day was well below the total universe of opportunities. So -- what I wanted to point out is that we're only going to issue equity in the future, and that could be far in the future to the point that it's value accretive to shareholders, and we haven't also tapped other sources that we intend to tap, which is our asset recycling program. So as you saw with where you run, as we've seen, as we've executed on the renewable sell-downs, as we exit further coal assets, we have a lot of upside in that asset sale number. So at this point, it's indefinitely into the future and our share price would need to be substantially higher than where it is today, and it would have to be value accretive to shareholders on a per share basis.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertDurgesh, another point I'd like to make is that we've been very effective at bringing in partners to fund our projects. So that's obviously another lever that we have. So we laid out what could be a possible path. We were very conservative on the numbers. But if we don't feel that we want to, at some point in the future, issue equity, we can always invite partners into our project. Of course, we're giving them part of the upside as well.OperatorOur next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroI was wondering just what's your latest thinking on just the hydrogen PTC timing in terms of treasury guidance here and what the rules around matching and additionality might be? And kind of just in coordination with that, what are your -- what's your current like project pipeline and discussions with potential partners on that side of the business as it stands currently?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertSure. Great question. Well, of course, the final rules haven't come out. What I would like to say is that our Felix project -- our project in Texas is -- really would meet the very strictest criteria. So it is additional. It is hourly matched. It is regional. So it has the very lowest carbon footprint technically feasible in the U.S. So I'd like to put that right out there that our project is not dependent in any way about how the rules come out. .Now having said that, I do believe that additionality is important. I also believe that we have to move to early matching, in part because we need green hydrogen projects to be tradable goods. So these are the rules in Europe. I also think regionality is important, so we don't add further congestion. So really, what we want is that the new rules come out, help us create a market, but they also help lower our total carbon footprint. So we don't want to just be squeezing the balloon, taking off renewable energy from the grid to produce green hydrogen. And we can get into more specifics there. So I do expect that the rules will come out, we'll incorporate some of these factors. But I want to say that our projects are very solid. We have committed off-takers, which I think is the key because this market for green hydrogen is developing. So to have early-on projects, I think the key is not only have a great project, and it -- with a very low carbon footprint. So you get all of the benefits of the IRA, but to have a committed off-taker.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Great. That's helpful color. And then I was curious if you could speak to the transmission challenges just related to transmission interconnection in the renewable industry. You alluded to it in your commentary, but I was wondering if you could speak to what your kind of current pipeline of maybe transmission queue positions and also with regard to like early stage development, land positions, things like that. How soon could a transmission constraint potentially impact your business? And how are you positioned now to kind of avoid that in the foreseeable future?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertWell, look, I think transmission constraints are affecting the market already. So we got out early, and we started getting a filing for interconnections on a big way 3 years ago in key markets like PJM and CAISO. So I think we're in a good position there. I think right now, we have a new industry here. And so I think we have to come to terms with the new definitions. What is pipeline? So for us, pipeline is projects that we already have, either land rights, interconnection rights, real prospects to make a project. And then, of course, there are different phases. Some projects are far more advanced shovel ready and some are more at the beginning of the queue. I think having looked at a lot of say, proposals from other developers, they count pipeline things that are -- we would call prospects. And I think we have to move towards a common definition, I mean, a little bit perhaps like the oil sector, which has possible reserves, has probable reserves and has proven reserves, right? And I think what's very important is that the -- to get a pipeline, you have to invest and you have to have money. So some of the new changes, for example, on the interconnections will make it a little bit more costly just sort of spurious flood the zone request for interconnections. So maybe Steve can give you some comments on how that is progressing, which would be favorable to us. We don't see any sort of short-run effect of it. But in the long run, it's favorable to us because I think we've been the most, I would say, stringent about what we consider pipeline. And what we're very interested in doing is maximizing the conversion rate. But I do also want to emphasize that if somebody comes to us, a client, and ask us to complete on advanced stage development project, that's the best of all worlds because we get to conserve the pipeline. We weren't investing money when it was at the highest risk stage and can bring it online more quickly and satisfy that client.Stephen CoughlinYes. And I would just add to that, look, I mean, we're very pleased with the final rules coming out of the third quarter 2023. But although, as Andre said, we've -- this has been our strategy to lead renewables development for many years. So we put ourselves in an advantaged position, I think, many years ago getting into these queues. Nonetheless, it is important for the industry overall for these queues to be move along faster in the process to be more efficient. So having the higher financial thresholds to get into the queue and to stay in the queue, having to demonstrate project maturity in terms of permits, and financing behind them, having cluster studies so that this isn't just a one by one review process. And then having the penalties and the teeth behind the deadlines that have to be met to do the studies is also important. So there's a number of angles at which this issue is being approached through the order. The order is due to be published, I think, very soon and will go into effect 60 days later. I think it's a great thing for the industry. We've already felt great about our position. But of course, over the longer term to have these queues cleaned up and moving faster is very important, and I think will further accelerate growth throughout the rest of the decade.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertAnd I say, look, we're also taking sort of technological -- a look at how we can improve transmission for our projects. So this is like using the grid stack to be able to baseload transmission lines, which were really peakers. This means dynamic line rating. This means using our prefab solar, which takes about half the space to be able to put higher loads where we have a good interconnection. And you also noticed that we're putting large battery projects where we have interconnections from our decommissioned coal plants. So we're looking at this problem rather holistically. And again, I think we're in a very good position to take advantage of what's going to be an increasingly congested grid.OperatorOur next question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan.Richard Wallace SunderlandCircling back to the data center commentary from your scripts. Curious how much of a near-term change in C&amp;I demand you're seeing from this subsector specifically? And any indications of upside just on that ramp over the next 1 to 2 years relative to what you were seeing maybe 6 months or a year ago?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI would say yes. I mean, the -- there's some definitions that they are waiting for in various markets, but about rules of where you can locate data centers. But no, we're definitely seeing increased interest and increasing demand, and we are the largest provider to U.S. data centers. And so I think we can uniquely provide data centers with the same quality of service, for example, in certain markets abroad, be it Mexico, Chile, Brazil, which is another advantage for us. So yes, we are seeing increased demand from that sector.Richard Wallace SunderlandGot it. Very helpful. And then just wanted to parse the kind of backlog pipeline conversation a little bit more finally for the hydrogen. It sounds like the 1.4 gigawatts for Texas could come in this year. Could you just speak a little bit more to your confidence level there for '23 specifically, and what you're focused on there? And then thinking about the balance of the hydrogen opportunities, when could those come in over the next few years?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertWell, again, I think we're the most advanced in terms of real green hydrogen projects. So in the U.S., we have committed off-takers for that project in Texas. We have several other projects, including 2 of the hubs, 1 in Los Angeles also 1 in Houston. I would say that we could sign the first project this year. It will be -- we're coming online for 2027 outside our guidance range. And the subsequent wins would be somewhat further out, '27, '28. But what we're seeing is strong demand. And basically, we are seen as a preferred partner by several people. And we also have very good projects, for example, in Chile, which is to green the mining sector. They're heavy equipment. We've already greened their electricity use, and a possible ammonia export project in the Northeast of Brazil. So again, stay tuned, but I feel quite confident in saying we're the most advanced in projects with committed off-takers. And we think we will hit these numbers. It's really a question of as they come online because you have to have the equipment that can use it. Certainly, in the shorter term, you can substitute green hydrogen in thermal processes in a lot of petrochemicals or steel plants, other things like that. So we have to see as this market develops. But again, I think we're very well-positioned. It's a very exciting opportunity for us.Richard Wallace SunderlandUnderstood. Very helpful. And then just one final one for me. The Bellefield project, you've been very clear in a lot of the messaging around how that came together. I'm just curious in terms of considerations around Phase 2 versus Phase 1. Just Phase 1 your return thresholds on a stand-alone basis. How do you think about the progress to signing Phase 2? Anything you can offer there would be helpful.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI think we're well advanced on Phase 2 is what I'm willing to say. It would be a similar project to Phase 1. So that is the largest solar plus storage project in the U.S., in California. So it's a very unique offering that we can bring together.OperatorOur next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo I wanted to start with some high-profile management departures we've seen since the Analyst Day, basically from your core businesses, right, the U.S. utilities and U.S. renewables. I mean, you might be just victims of your own success in a sense, but just how you can reassure us that there's no change in the execution of your growth plans, especially in these 2 businesses and the demand that you have to fill those vacancies?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertAngie, and thanks for that question. And I think you got it spot on. Look, this is, quite frankly, a symptom of strength in our case. We have the hottest management team in the market. And so of course, people are going to be being made offers. And if people are obviously -- if they want to go to private equity and bet on a longer-term IPO, that's their right. But this in no way affects our business whatsoever. And I think the best proof of that is after the departure in clean energy, we've signed more PPIs. So we're doing very well. I don't expect it to have any impact on the business. And I expect the same in U.S. utilities. I don't expect this will have any impact whatsoever. But it is a sign of that, yes, we have a strong team, we have a deep bench, and we'll continue to identify talent and prepare it and move it up. Again, let's say, where AES was in, say, in 2012 or something, our team wasn't the hottest in the business, people wouldn't be trying to poach it. So it is what it is, but I feel very good about where we are, and it doesn't change our plans whatsoever. And I think the teams are very motivated on executing on the plans that we laid out.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then moving on, I mean, you talked a lot about your backlog of renewable power projects. So -- and then potential monetization of assets in the world of equity. So first, on the backlog, I mean, we've heard stories about some public renewable power developers basically shoving in their backlog third-party projects where they don't have exclusivity for these projects. So again, this is just anecdotal evidence, but I'm just wondering if you've heard of those instances and if any of this could be true for you guys?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertWell, I can say categorically, absolutely, under no uncertain terms, we have no such projects in our backlog. I want to make very clear because maybe some other people are doing that. I think that's not transparent. I would not recommend anybody do it. In our case, whatever we have in the backlog, we are -- we have the project, we are committed to delivering it on a certain date for a certain amount of time, and our clients have an obligation to take that energy -- a certain amount of energy for a certain amount of time. So this is binding for both sides. And the fact that 43% of our backlog is currently being built, we have ordered all the equipment for our '23 through '25 backlog, and about 3/4 of them will come online by 2025. So I want to make very clear that's a good question. I wouldn't recommend anybody to do that. And I can say, categorically, we would never do something like that.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then on the monetization of assets. So I understand that there is a very big difference between the assets that recently transacted and the ones that you are developing, it's only because of the duration of the PPAs, so basically the duration of the cash flows. But on the flip side, right, you have higher discount rates for the DCF value of those cash flows. So I'm just thinking if you were to monetize some of these assets, again, I guess it all depends where the stock is. But again, how would that, from your perspective, demonstrate the value of the portfolio that you currently have?Stephen CoughlinYes, Angie, this is Steve. So look, we have, as you know, have been selling down our renewable projects after they've come online and we package them together in portfolio. So we have seen some, I would say, relatively small uptick in return requirements there, but nothing outside the range of what we expected within our plan in terms of -- this is -- these are very low-risk assets. They're solar coupon, essentially, no fuel costs, very low maintenance. So these are very predictable, and the demand for these assets continues to be very strong. So we don't see any impact to the plan for how we sell down from sort of where rates are in the market today. Does that address your question?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI think -- I mean the other thing is that these are -- all investment-grade quality off-takers -- the very highest quality off-takers that you can have. So we are selling down the premium product in the market. So I think it's important to say that, look, people have talked about inflation, people have talked about rising interest rates, we're not seeing a degradation of our margins. So the margin of our money into these projects, we're not seeing any squeeze whatsoever.Stephen CoughlinYes. And on top of that -- so just as Andres pointed out, with the Chevelon Butte project, we have the energy community adder for that project. And actually, most -- all of our wind projects going forward, we expect to qualify for the domestic adder as well, Angie, so there's some significant offsets to the cost of financing that we've been achieving too.OperatorOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithI know a lot has been said here already, but let me follow up on some details here, just on the year-over-year comparisons here as we go to the back half of the year, if I may. Look, I'd love to talk about -- I think you have in your slides here, $0.24 of positive net impact in the back half of the year from renewables and year-over-year comps on LNG. But if I rewind here, I think you said in the back half of the year that -- I mean, last year, it was like $0.30 contribution from LNG. Just as I think about that, that seems like a pretty big step-up year-over-year in renewables. Can you talk about what renewables' assumptions you're baking in as sort of a discrete item in -- especially in the back half of the year to sort of make up for what you need to get to your guidance? And then if I think about the start of the year, right, in terms of what you talked about renewable contributing, I think we talked about $0.27 for the full year. So -- it seems like what's implied here again, I'm curious that renewable is actually contributing more than what we thought at the start of the year and maybe what that says for future years as well. But please tell me, respond accordingly.Stephen CoughlinOkay. So yes, this is Steve, Julien. So the $0.30 it doesn't -- sound correct or actually more like $0.20 is the LNG year-over-year delta to be offset. And then, of course, we're more than doubling the renewable commissioning this year. So if you recall, it was just around 1 gigawatt last year, and it's 2.1 gigawatts this year, most all of which is in the second half of the year. So what we're carrying in the first half is sort of more of the cost in renewables. The EBITDA has been relatively flat through the first half. In the second half, then we're going to see that renewable number pick up substantially, and that's why we have the 75% loading on the second half of the year earnings. That's a major driver. The other is, of course, utility demand in Ohio and Indiana peaking in Q3. You've got Southland, where we have the peak cooling season in the third quarter. And then we have hydro in Latin America, typically, the volumes are much higher as we come out of the wet season in the summer and the winter and you have the snow melt into the fall. So those are really the primary drivers is the clean energy, Southland, the utilities and then some of the hydro assets in Latin America having much more volume in the second half of the year. But the LNG offset is really only about $0.20 for the -- and mostly in the third quarter.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithIs there a use on that -- sorry, go forward.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertI was just saying we're executing exactly what we laid out at the beginning of the year. So there's been no change. I want to make that clear.Stephen CoughlinYes. Yes, this is -- I think we're right at $0.25 on the EPS, Julien, year-to-date. So this is -- what we're seeing, although the year-over-year in the quarter is lower, that's primarily due to coal retirements in Chile as we've done the Green Blend and Extend, some of the coal that's still there, the margins have come down, which was all expected. So we're exactly on track. And also, to your point, there is some potential upside, as Andres noted, we feel really good about being on track with the construction program and there still remains the upside on the 600 megawatts potential.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. But the point is the plan for $0.27 of renewables contribution in '23 unchanged from the start of the year still?Stephen CoughlinYes. Let us get back to you on the exact number because I don't have that math in front of me, but the renewables contribution is looking at least on track, is what I would say.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithOkay. Wonderful. If I can take a slight different direction here, trying to follow up on a few earlier questions. Just on the asset sale dynamics versus equity, can you comment a little bit further about what else you're seeing out there? Or what else could be monetized just as you think about deemphasizing equity. It sounds like the principal lever, Andres, you were alluding to is that you would just sell down your interest in the new renewables even more so. Is that fair to say in terms of like the alternative lever here versus the corporate level equity? And also just to clarify the point you made earlier on just very precisely, at these levels today, you would definitively move away from the equity levels that you -- equity issuance levels you defined earlier, in lieu of these alternatives?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertSo on the first point, no, it's not fair. Characterization is not fair. So what -- look, all right, we have partnerships in all of our businesses. So we don't necessarily have to do it on the new projects. So we can bring in partners to -- money is fungible. So if we monetize a different business, that means we have more money available for renewables. We will -- as we have in the past, pick and choose to optimize the return on invested capital. And I think that we're doing a very good job of how we exit coal. I think the Warrior Run monetization, I think it's probably better than people's expectations. And so we continue to manage that. So all I'm saying is that -- we never -- as Steve said in his script, we didn't -- we put this out as a 5-year plan. And in the 5-year plan, we had a certain amount of asset sales, a conservative number, and we had a sort of range for potential equity issuance as well. So the two somewhat offset each other. So if we do better on the asset sales, we will need less equity and we do better in terms of bringing in partnerships. So what we're saying at these levels, we do not feel comfortable issuing equity. But I think it's been very clear from our presentation that we have tremendous demand for what we're doing. And that is a once-in-a-lifetime market opportunity. So we want to create the most value for our shareholders from that opportunity. So obviously, if we don't have -- what we feel is correctly valued equity, we'll have to use other levers. And this should be nothing new to you guys. We have financed a remarkable change in this company without issuing any equity. We did it by selling down assets. We got into wind by bringing in partners. So what we're saying is nothing like a promise for the future. It's just more of the same. So we will use whatever the levers creates the most value for our shareholders, and we will continue to do so.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. Right. So your point ultimately is not committing to selling down partners per se, a variety of different sources here incrementally just not issuing the equity at current levels. And if I can also clarify this, Maritza process is underway. I know that it was listed in the queue here as well. Is that still status quo in a way?Stephen CoughlinNo, there's no -- there's no specific Maritza process underway, Julien, at this point. So still evaluating different pathways for Maritza.OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi.Ryan Michael LevineA couple of specific follow-on questions. Is your Fluence stayed core to your portfolio? And I guess secondly, on the financing side, are you still open to considering the convert market to help offset equity issuance?Stephen CoughlinSo this is Steve. So yes, Fluence is part of the portfolio we own roughly 1/3, 34% of Fluence. It is not consolidated, but it does come in through equity method. And we do, in our adjusted EBITDA definition include an adjustment to include Fluence EBITDA. So that does show up and it's in our new energy technologies SBU influence margin...Ryan Michael LevineThe question is that core, is that core?Stephen CoughlinIs it core? Or did you say -- is it core to our business?Ryan Michael LevineCore.Stephen CoughlinSo look, I mean, I would say core -- so given that it's an outside business, I don't think I would parse this out as like core or non-core. It's been a really important strategy for us to be able to lead in energy storage, both in development as well as in the technology as well as sort of advancing the way that storage gets used to create the innovative solutions we've done like 24/7 carbon-free energy to make those products work. We've done a lot of co-innovation, co-development with Fluence around that. So that's, I would say, definitely core to our strategy is what we've been able to do with storage. But as Andres said many times, these are technology businesses of their own right. They're separated. We are not in them indefinitely, and we continue to grow new opportunities. And as we do we may look to monetize part of our positions down the road. No time soon, and we see a lot of value upside. We're very pleased with how the new management team has driven value already that's been recognized, but we still see a lot of upside and there's a lot of partnership that we continue to work on new solutions around. So it is core from that perspective that I laid out.Ryan Michael LevineOkay. And then on the convert option?Stephen CoughlinSo no, nothing that we're contemplating at this point. I mean, look, we did a $900 million debt deal just in the second quarter. Nothing -- no specific convert for us contemplated at this point.Ryan Michael LevineOkay. And then last question. In terms of Puerto Rico, what's your strategy there from existing assets and future development perspective?Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertWell, in Puerto Rico, we're greening the island's energy grid. So we do have renewal projects. We're bringing in batteries as well. And it's our plan to phase out coal by 2025. So we're assisting the island and its energy transition. And I think we've been very clear what our objectives are.OperatorOur final question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillYes. Probably quick. On AES Ohio, is the TPL rate case, how does that timing compare with what you were assuming in guidance or any other differences with how that's proceeding versus the '23 guidance?Stephen CoughlinYes. Gregg, it's right on track with what we assumed in our guidance. So the decision has been put on the agenda for next week, August 9, that was just published, I believe, yesterday. So right on track in terms of when we assume the decision to be made. And we still feel really good about where that is likely to come out. As a reminder, once the decision is made, ESP 4 put in place, then the new rates that were decided upon last year immediately go into effect. And as we've laid out, the riders would go into effect and then the frequent quarterly recovery on our distribution investments going forward would start to be put in place. And so this is a business really pivoting to a very different phase from where we've been delevering and setting that business up for a more normalized structure. This is an important pivot point for Ohio to really pivot to growth, and there's a lot of room for growth as there's the lowest rates in the state there in all customer classes. And even with the ESP 4, the new rates, we expect it to continue to be the lowest rates in the state for the foreseeable future. And we have, as Andres noted, 10%-plus rate base growth expected going forward. So we're very excited about this and look forward to the decision next week.Andres Ricardo Gluski WeilertYes. And I'm also very excited about that Dayton is finally getting incoming investment. So you have a new Honda EV plant, you have a battery plant coming into our service area. So you're starting to see an economic recovery. Dayton had sort of been not participating in the expansion that we had seen in Eastern Ohio. So it's a very exciting time, and we're very happy that we could invest and continue to improve the quality of service and continue to attract new investments into the Dayton area. So it's not only a rate base story, I think there's an economic recovery story happening in Dayton for the first time in decades. So it's a very exciting time to be in Dayton.OperatorI will now hand back to Susan Harcourt for any closing remarks.Susan Pasley Keppelman HarcourtWe thank everybody for joining us on today's call.

GM has vowed to end the sale of new ICE vehicles by 2035.Another key issue in the talks involves pay and treatment of workers at GM's joint venture battery plants.Separately, CFRA Research on Friday downgraded GM on concerns about a possible strike after the UAW sought large pay and benefit hikes. GM shares closed down 1% to $36.57.Stellantis said on Friday it intends ""to fairly reward our represented employees for their contributions to the success of the Company. However, it will be critical to find common ground that doesn’t jeopardize our ability to continue investing.""The UAW is seeking a pay hike of more than 40% over the life of the four-year contract, including an initial 20% hike upon ratification and 5% annual wage hikes starting in September 2024, according to sources and a copy of the proposal.GM said on Thursday the UAW proposals ""would threaten our ability to do what's right for the long-term benefit of the team.""The union is seeking substantial wage and benefit changes, including defined-benefit pensions for all workers and shorter work weeks.It wants to make all temporary workers at U.S. automakers permanent, a substantial increase in paid time off and restore retiree health care benefits and cost of living adjustments.

The S&amp;P 500 is up about 1,000 points, or ~27%, from that trough. The question for investors now is, what happens next?Mike Wilson, the well-known strategist from Morgan Stanley, has a reputation as an uber-bear, but he’s pulling back from that in a recent note. “The data we have today suggests to us that we are in a policy-driven, late-cycle rally,” Wilson says. He goes on to note several supportive factors, including a reduced rate of inflation, the deceleration of the Fed’s tightening policy, and the widespread consensus that the last rate hike, of 25 basis points, was the last of this tightening cycle – and that the Fed will shift toward easier money later this year.Wilson also draws attention to similarities between current conditions and 2019, the last time the Fed was pushing monetary easing, noting, “The 2019 analogy, in and of itself, suggests more index level upside from here.”Looking ahead, Wilson believes we’re in for gains as 2023 heads towards its close, and his colleagues among the Morgan Stanley stock analysts are taking that thought and running with it. The firm’s analysts are picking out stocks with ‘more upside ahead,’ and have tagged two that they feel will surge by 50% or better from their current levels. Let’s take a closer look.Altus Power (AMPS)The first Morgan Stanley-endorsed name takes us to the utility sector, where Altus Power works in the solar energy niche. The solar energy segment as a whole has received a policy boost from the Biden Administration, a boost that was codified with the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law last year. Altus is a customer-focused company offering solar power installations for commercial, industrial, and community use across the US. The Connecticut-based company has operations in the upper Mississippi Valley, in the southeast, and the southwest, but the bulk of its operations are in the northeast and in California.Story continuesIn addition to solar power installations, Altus offers energy storage and electric vehicle charging services. The company boasts that every installation is tailored to the specific customer needs; its commercial operations are designed to bring the customer on board with the project development process in order to streamline the permitting, construction, and commissioning processes, while the community ops focus on sustainable and renewable options to provide clean energy for residents. Altus boasts that it has installed over 4.55 billion kilowatt-hours of solar power since 2009.Altus will report its 2Q23 results later this month, but a look back at Q1, and the months since, is revealing. The company reported $29.4 million in revenues for Q1, which was up 53% year-over-year. The company’s bottom line, measured by GAAP, was 3 cents, beating the estimates by 6 cents. The company claimed a total portfolio of approximately 686 installed megawatts of power generation, a total that included 8 megawatts which had been completed in April and May.This brings us to one of Altus’ key strengths: the company’s commitment to continually expanding its network. Since the Q1 results were released, Altus has also announced the acquisition of 4.4 megawatts of power generation facilities in California, adding to the 112 megawatt total portfolio in that state. And, also in July, Altus announced it had added a new 10-megawatt solar power system plus a 15-megawatt-hour battery storage system to its assets in Massachusetts. Altus now operates in 25 states.Covering Altus for Morgan Stanley, analyst Andrew Percoco sees the company’s community installations as a unique asset that can be built on for further growth.“While AMPS is often pegged as a rooftop C&amp;I developer, which is true, it doesn’t fully encompass the wider market opportunity, which includes community solar (24% of existing portfolio). While the community solar market is small today, it provides a unique opportunity for the company to leverage the rooftop and land access from its C&amp;I customers to provide clean and affordable energy to residential customers that do not have the ability to add rooftop solar,” Percoco opined.“Based on our math, we see more upside opportunity than downside risk to the company’s 2023 guidance – note that the company exited 2022 with ~$79m of annualized EBITDA and after accounting for its True Green acquisition, which we estimate adds $17-$19m of contracted EBITDA in 2023, putting the company in reach of the low-end of its guidance, before considering the additional assets it is putting in service this year,” the analyst added.To this end, Percoco sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on AMPS, as well as a $10 price target that indicates his confidence in a 58% one-year potential upside. (To watch Percoco’s track record, click here)Overall, this solar power firm gets a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 6 positive analyst reviews set recently. Altus shares are trading at $6.31, and the $9.92 average price target suggests an upside of 57% in store for the next 12 months. (See AMPS stock forecast)United Airlines Holdings (UAL)The next Morgan Stanley pick is United Airlines, one of the major US legacy air carriers – and by some metrics, the world’s largest airline. The company offers more available seat miles than any other airline, but it is the third largest by total fleet size, with 893 aircraft in operation. That could soon change, as of this past December, United placed a blockbuster order with Boeing for 100 modern 787 wide-body Dreamliner passenger jets – and an option to buy another 100 going forward.United certainly has the infrastructure to expand its fleet. The company operates out of multiple hubs in the US – in such major locations as Chicago, Denver, Houston, LA, San Fran, New York/Newark, and DC – and flies approximately 5,000 daily routes to more than 342 locations on six continents. Among the North American air carriers, United has the most comprehensive global route network.The company has clearly benefited in recent quarters from the general post-COVID economic rebound. People want to travel, and are doing so now that pandemic restrictions are lifted. United has seen its quarterly earnings show consistent year-over-year gains since the beginning of 2022.The last reported quarter, 2Q23, was no exception. The company’s top line of $14.2 billion was up more than 17% year-over-year, and beat the forecasts by over $250 million. At the bottom line, United reported a solid non-GAAP EPS profit of $5.03, which was 97 cents ahead of the estimates. Perhaps the best metric, for investors, was the guidance on full-year adjusted EPS – United is predicting earnings in the range of $11 to $12 per share for the full year 2023 compared to the consensus forecast of $9.65.The recent earnings caught the attention of Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker, who wrote of United, “UAL has been the consensus long of the Airlines group YTD and the 2Q result, conference call commentary, and forward outlook gave no reason to dampen that enthusiasm. The bigger surprise was the ‘similar or slightly better’ Domestic PRASM commentary for 3Q which is a much better outlook than peers. Perhaps this reflects slightly different comps or just better mix at UAL but either way, it changes the narrative of UAL being an ‘international only’ story. The late June disruptions kept the beat and raise from being even bigger but sets up for an easier comp for 2024 – if UAL can get past its bottlenecks at Newark in the long-term.”Tracking this forward, Shanker rates the stock as Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a one-year price target of $80, suggesting a 52% gain from current levels. (To watch Shanker’s track record, click here)Overall, United has picked up 15 recent Wall Street analyst reviews, and these include 10 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell to give the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $52.42 and the $69.31 average price target implies a 32% upside on the one-year horizon.

At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amanda Ho. Ma'am, the floor is yours. Amanda Ho: Thank you, Matthew. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2023 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Andrew Cooper. Ted Geisler, APS' President; and Jacob Tetlow, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jose Esparza, Senior Vice President, Public Policy, are also here with us. First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our second quarter 2023 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&amp;A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 10, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Guldner: Great. Thanks, Amanda. Thank you all for joining us today. Although our second quarter financials were negatively impacted by significantly mild weather in June, as well as higher operating expenses, we have updated our full year 2023 guidance to take into account the settlement that was reached between APS and the commission on the SCR matter. Before Andrew goes through the details of our second quarter results and updates to our 2023 full year guidance, I'll just provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Starting with operations. As we progress through the summer season, I'm very proud to say that our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. The Palo Verde Generating Station successfully completed its planned refueling and maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 13. Additionally, we commissioned the remaining 60 megawatts of energy storage at our AZ Sun sites. So that totals now 201 megawatts of APS-owned storage installed this year and 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar at the Agave Solar facility. These are all valuable resources to help serve our customers through the summer season. In fact, while the second quarter was marked by extremely mild weather, as I think all of you probably know, July certainly heated up. Our robust planning, resource procurement efforts and our dedicated team have allowed us to provide exceptional service to our customers throughout this unprecedented heat wave. Phoenix experienced a record number of consecutive days of over 110 degrees, shattering prior records for daytime highs for evening lows for days over 110 degrees, and the APS team served its customers with top-tier reliability throughout it all. In fact, we broke our previous peak demand record multiple times this July, reaching a new all-time record on July 20 at nearly 8,200 megawatts. That's a 500-megawatt increase compared to our prior record that was set in 2020. I want to recognize our operators and our field teams for doing such an exceptional job in making sure that customers continue to have reliable service through this unrelenting heat. As you know, APS plans years in advance to continue serving customers with reliable and affordable energy, our resource planners secure a diverse energy mix to meet demand like solar and wind power, battery energy storage and our APS operated Palo Verde Generating Station, which is still the largest nuclear plant in the U.S. and the country's largest producer of clean energy. When temperatures caused demand to increase, APS' strength and resilience comes from using flexible resources like natural gas to keep homes and businesses cool over long stretches of extreme heat. Another important tool that I want to highlight and that we utilize is our Cool Rewards demand response program. It's in its fifth year of operation. That program essentially operates as a virtual power plant where our customers provide over 110 megawatts of flexible clean capacity. The program connects nearly 80,000 APS customers with smart thermostat technology that helps them save money while also playing an integral role in conserving energy when the demand on the electric grid is its highest. This partnership helps us to ensure reliable, uninterrupted service to our customers on the hottest Arizona days, while also assisting us on our journey to 100% clean in carbon-free electricity by 2050. So you can see we've taken all of the above approach to provide the most affordable and reliable service when our customers need us the most. And as part of our vigorous planning, we recently issued an all-source RFP for another 1,000 megawatts to be online between 2026 and 2028. We're seeking the best combination of resources to serve our customers reliable – reliably while not sacrificing affordability and continuing to build towards our clean energy future. Additionally, we continue to remain focused on providing exceptional customer service. Our J.D. Power, JDP residential rankings for overall customer satisfaction have steadily improved over the past two years. And I'm proud to share that the latest JDP residential 2023 second quarter results have placed us back in the first quartile compared to our peers. APS is the strongest performing drivers in the latest survey where customer care, both phone and digital power quality and reliability and corporate citizenship. We've made remarkable progress over the past few years moving from fourth quartile to first and that progress would not have happened without the dedication and commitment of our hard-working employees across the company. I look forward to continuing to provide exemplary service to our customers in the future. Turning to our regulatory updates. Last quarter, I spoke about the appeal of our last rate case and the favorable Court of Appeals decision. The commission directed its legal staff to enter into negotiations with the company. And in June, we reached an agreement with the commission legal staff on how to implement that decision. The joint resolution was then approved at the June open meeting, and it created a court resolution surcharge that started on July 1. We're pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the commission in a reasonable and expeditious manner to resolve this issue. And as I've mentioned previously, the Four Corners Power Plant is a critically important reliability asset for the entire Southwest. And the investment in SCRs was required to keep that plant running under federal law. Andrew will address the financial impacts from this decision here in a few minutes. On our rate case, we are almost done with all rounds of written testimony. Our rejoinder testimony is due tomorrow. The hearing is scheduled to begin on August 10. And we look forward to working through that process and resolving this rate case in a timely and constructive manner. We made solid progress through the first half of this year, improving our customer experience, enhancing our stakeholder relationships and executing on our regulatory matters. There is certainly more work to do, but I think this is a good opportunity to acknowledge the team's dedication and early accomplishments here in 2023. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Cooper: Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2023 financial results. I will first review those results, which were negatively impacted by extremely mild weather and provide some additional details on the various drivers for the quarter. I will also provide an update to full year 2023 guidance. We earned $0.94 per share this quarter, down $0.51 compared to the second quarter last year. Weather, specifically during the month of June, was the primary driver for the lower year-over-year results. June of 2023 was the mildest since 2009 with an average daily temperature slightly below 90 degrees. This resulted in a $0.25 year-over-year drag from weather compared to Q2 last year, which was – which notably included an above average contribution from June 2022's hot weather. Higher O&amp;M, interest expense and depreciation and amortization and lower pension and OPEB non-service credits were other negative drivers, partially offset by higher transmission revenues and LFCR revenues. O&amp;M was $0.21 higher year-over-year or $0.14, excluding RES and DSM. We have experienced year-over-year increases to most of our O&amp;M categories due to inflation and high customer growth. We have seen inflationary impacts in areas, including chemicals, materials, insurance and wage rates. Of the $0.14 Q2 headwind, O&amp;M associated with our generation fleet constitutes $0.10. And for the first half of the year, generation fleet O&amp;M has been a $0.21 drag. Prioritizing the needs of our generation fleet to ensure reliability for customers has been essential to our summer preparedness strategy. The importance of this prioritization was as clear as ever as our team successfully ran our fleet during the month of July. In addition, as Jeff mentioned, July weather was record-breaking. And similar to past years, the weather benefits have allowed us to flex up to derisk future spending. Based on the O&amp;M trends we are seeing, we are increasing our O&amp;M guidance range for 2023 to $915 million to $935 million. Importantly, even with this update, we anticipate our O&amp;M per megawatt hour to be flat to last year, and we maintain our goal of declining O&amp;M per megawatt hour into the future. We continue to look for opportunities to create efficiencies, reduce risk and keep our costs low to maintain affordable rates for our customers. Turning now to customer growth, we continue to be in line with expectations. Customer growth remains at 2% for the second quarter. The fundamentals for customer growth remains strong in our service territory, and Arizona continues to be a popular migration destination. Redfin.com noted in May that Phoenix Lebination in housing markets its users were most interested in moving into. The cost of living in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area still compare favorably to many Western markets. So, we continue to project steady population growth and corresponding APS customer growth largely driven by net migration. However, weather normalized sales growth for the quarter was 0.1% compared to last year. Although we continue to see steady C&amp;I sales growth, which came in at 2.2% for the second quarter this year versus last year. Overall sales growth has been slower than originally anticipated. We continue to monitor our extra high load factor customers as they ramp up. And in fact, Taiwan Semiconductor recently announced a delay in the opening of their first chip factory. With the flat year-over-year sales growth in the quarter and slower ramp-up of these larger customers, we are revising our sales growth guidance range to 2% to 4% for 2023. Because sales from these larger customers contribute a lower margin, the change to our sales growth guidance has a disproportionately smaller impact to earnings expectations. Over the longer term, we continue to forecast a strong contribution to sales growth from advanced manufacturing and other large customers though the variable remains the speed of their ramp-up. Turning to our 2023 guidance for EPS, with the approval by the commission of the joint resolution of the 2019 rate case appeal, on July 1, we began collecting a corresponding surcharge with an annualized impact of approximately $52.5 million. This surcharge includes both a prospective and historical portion and is collected through a per kilowatt hour charge. Taking all financial drivers into account, including this additional revenue, July temperatures but normalized weather thereafter, anticipated lower sales growth and the higher O&amp;M trends mentioned earlier, we now expect our new EPS guidance range to be $4.10 to $4.30 per share for the year. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy and on the next phases of our pending rate case process. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is live. Dariusz Lozny: Hey guys, good morning. This is Dariuzs on for Julian. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to start off on the rate case if I could. Staff obviously came out with a recent round of testimony and specifically, the generation rider that you’ve proposed and revised during the course of the rate case. Just wondering if you could comment on staff views there. And in the event that, that rider isn’t ultimately supported by the commission in this rate case outcome, how that might affect your procurement/capital strategy going forward? Jeff Guldner: Yes, hi Dariusz. This is Jeff. Let me start with kind of the context of the rider. It came up in the Tucson Electric rate case ultimately didn’t make it into the administrative law judges’ recommendation. That case is going to open meeting here pretty quickly. We have filed it and we’re going to continue to advocate for it because we think it’s an appropriate way of addressing regulatory lag. And you can see with just the growth that we’re seeing, the need for that additional generation and need to have that balance between not just PPAs, but some that we can more directly control and really control the deployment of that capital. That as well as the ability to find a mechanism that we can flow through the production tax credits is going to be important. So we think there is good reasons to continue to advocate for it. I think what you’re seeing that is still modestly encouraging is that there is an interest from staff in understanding the value and the concept. And so that’s really what the hearing process, I think, is going to give us an opportunity to do is to advocate and explain why this makes sense in the context of where we are. And I’d be more concerned if it was pretty just a flat no, we’re not interested. And I think you can see from the testimony from the dialogue in the Tucson case that there is an interest in understanding it. We’re not quite there yet, and I hope that we’ll have an opportunity at hearing to really explain why we see significant value moving forward with this and not just coming back in which is your other alternative is you come right back in another rate case pretty quickly if there’s not a way to address this kind of – the regulatory lag that comes from getting those plants into service, but not into rates efficiently. Andrew, you want to talk maybe on the capital? Andrew Cooper: Sure, Dariusz, it’s Andrew. To date, going back to the last rate case, we’ve been reluctant to bring forward our projects that have been cost competitive with the market because of the question around recovery. And the SRB, as Jeff talked about, really would be an important tool to help us think about taking what’s been less than maybe 20% of the megawatts that we’ve been procuring over the last couple of years and increase that number. Ultimately, we’re going to make the investments that we need to make for reliability. And the two projects that are in our post-test year plant that relate to our generation fleet, Jeff talked about, those were commissioned this summer, our [indiscernible] solar project as well as the batteries at our AZ Sun sites. Those were projects that were commissioned for this summer, and those were really critical. And as some of the developers we work with have supply chain delays and some of those challenges, our ability to deliver, I think, has been highlighted through those post tester plants. So we will continue to look at ways to reduce lag and ultimately make the decisions that we need to make around capital from our perspective to make sure that we’re delivering each summer as we’ve seen these increasing peak demand numbers. Dariusz Lozny: Great. Thank you for that detail. I appreciate that. One more, if I could. I just wanted to come back to the generation related O&amp;M spending that Andrew highlighted in the opening remarks. Specifically, how do you see that shaping up for the back half of the year, just given the amount that you have to run the generation resources, obviously, during this extremely hot weather. Do you anticipate that there’s sort of some additional catch-up O&amp;M, if you will, in the latter part of the year? And then related, assuming the weather normalizes in 2024 or thereafter, do you see that as an opportunity to flex down that O&amp;M in future periods. Andrew Cooper: Yes, Dariusz. So, taking the first part of that. So, the guidance range that we updated today incorporate anticipated O&amp;M kind of across the year. And so we’ve seen in the first half of the year absolutely the generation fleet. And from this July, there’ll certainly be continued needs. And so we’ve anticipated those. And frankly, have in part used the benefit of July weather to look at the rest of the year and think about what are the needs we have and where are the pressure points? And if weather were to continue to be a factor for the rest of the year, absolutely making sure that we could generate support the generation fleet, both Palo Verde as well as our traditional fleet. It’s definitely part of the calculus. And so then when you think about weather for the rest of the year, post July, which we’ve incorporated at this point and has been part of strategically thinking about O&amp;M. Every year, at the end of the summer, we look at our O&amp;M opportunity set and risk set for the remainder of the year and into the next calendar year and think about where we could flex our muscle around pull forward derisking. And so we’ll do that to the upside and downside as the year goes on. We’re comfortable with the new O&amp;M range that we’ve set out based on where we are, the decisions we’ve made, effectively, conversations that we normally have in October once you’ve looked at the full summer, we’re making those earlier. So, we’re comfortable with the range that we’re in. And certainly, as we have weather, as we have continued wear and tear on our generation fleet, we’ve accommodated that within the current range.Dariusz Lozny: Okay, great. Thank you very much for that detail. I’ll pass it along here. Andrew Cooper: Thanks, Dariusz. Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Mortimer from Mizuho. Your line is live. Alex Mortimer: Hi, good morning. Jeff Guldner: Hi, Alex. Alex Mortimer: So, with the dual tailwind of new rates next year and the load increase that was expected this year materializing more in 2024, how should we think about the linearity of earnings in 2024 and 2025 and beyond kind of within the long-term growth rate should we expect to be at the higher end of the 5% to 7%, or should we think that there could potentially be more of a onetime step-up in 2024 given coming out of the rate case? Andrew Cooper: Yes, Alex, we are definitely focused on the tools that we have at our disposal to create more linear, predictable earnings stream within that 5% to 7% growth rate. And so we're comfortable with the 5% to 7% rate. Certainly we'll be updating all of the key drivers of our financial performance after the rate case concludes. Inevitably, given the outcome of the 2019 rate case and the financial reset there, rate relief will be a meaningful driver of our growth over the medium term. It's hard to avoid that fact. However, the work we're doing around how do we manage O&amp;M within the context of weather from year-to-year? How do we push for more capital to be tracked so we can create more rate gradualism for customers, but also more linearity for shareholders? Those are the levers within our control that we're trying to deliver within that long-term EPS growth rate range a little bit more of a predictable track within it. Ultimately, doing the things that are within our control and managing costs as best we can. Alex Mortimer: Understood. Has there been any discussion internally about how to potentially think of a new base year for the long-term growth rate, given the increased clarity and potential step up, we'll see following the resolution of the case later this year? Andrew Cooper: Yes. Alex, that's all, I think a conversation that we could have after the rate case. Ultimately, over the long-term we want to be able to through a linear earnings stream, create a long-term earnings growth rate that isn't based on a base here. That is a continuous product of more predictable, less regulatory lag; and so those are the things that we're focused on to create that. So it becomes less about a specific base here. But as far as updating from our current 5% to 7% of 2022 weather normalized guidance, that's a conversation we can have after the rate case. Alex Mortimer: Alright. Thank you so much. I'll leave it there. Jeff Guldner: Thanks Alex. Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is live. Paul Patterson: Hey. Good morning. Jeff Guldner: Hey Paul. Andrew Cooper: Hey Paul. Paul Patterson: So, I apologize if I just, I wanted to sort of just follow up again on the rate case. In the past, you guys were thinking that was potential that there'd be a settlement. And I'm just sort of wondering where things maybe stand with respect to that potential given that we've had so many filings now and what have you? Jeff Guldner: Yes. As we mentioned we're just here a day away from filing, rejoin our testimony. So you got five rounds of testimony and the hearing scheduled to start in a week or so. So the likelihood that a settlement would sort of come up from there is low. We continue and we always look for opportunities to narrow issues or for opportunities to engage in a conversation around that. But I think right now, it certainly seems like we're moving towards hearing. I will say if you can follow on the testimony and the intervenors and the physicians on this case, that this is much more what I call a traditional rate case. It's a lot more fewer issues the more traditional things that are coming. So I think that that is positive in terms of where the case has evolved to. Paul Patterson: Yes. It's a notable change from the last one, I agree with that. I wanted to also just sort of ask you, I've never been to Arizona in the summer, and there's a lot of national media coverage of the recent heat wave. And I don't know whether or not it's being over dramatized or not, but it sounds like kind of extreme. And I'm just wondering, a) sort of your take on it because you guys are guys are native, so to speak, or at least close to it. And so b) I know you mentioned it doesn't seem to have impacted your outlook for growth. But just, I mean, I don't need to sort of check off the list of sort of horrors that they're describing in terms of people getting burned by just sitting on the sidewalk or I'm talking about like the Cactus is done kind of thing. Could you sort of just give a little more perspective on that? Jeff Guldner: Yes. I mean it's clearly a concern when you get into prolonged stretches of this. We've had, we had a hotter day number years ago I think the still record high day was actually quite a while ago. But it's the persistence of this heat wave that I think has really sort of challenged the policy makers. But the important thing to remember is that the heat in the desert in the summer is not new to us. And so there have been certainly cases where you've had multiple days in the north of 115, where you get the same kind of issues about being safe outside, making sure that you don't – you don't make contact with the pavement. The most important thing, I think, that the policymakers here are doing a nice job of is trying to address the unsheltered population. We've got, for example, [Paul an] (0:25:20) air conditioner program where we can help support through the foundation for senior living. People getting air conditioner repairs because those are where it gets really dangerous. If you're just in a home with an air conditioner, people are kind of used to this, I think, but it's certainly something that you need to look at from a resilience standpoint in ensuring that as you continue to see longer periods of hot weather that we've got the resilience to be able to navigate that. But people are still moving here. It's still a very I think it's still the fastest-growing county in the U.S. So I don't think the heat deters them, and it's kind of similar to what you deal with in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest where you've got the really cold winters, you just got to know how to adapt to it.Paul Patterson: Okay. Well, thanks so much. Jeff Guldner: Yes. Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shar Pourezza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is live. James Ward: Hi guys. It's James Ward on for Shar. How are you? Jeff Guldner: Great. Good Jim. Andrew Cooper: Hi James. James Ward: Hey. Just a quick one on the pension front; just leaving 2023 aside for the moment. If we were to assume that the final order reflects the pension-related adjustments from your rebuttal testimony; just thinking about the roughly $20 million or so improvement there. What impact would you expect that to have going forward on pension-related EPS drag, just thinking about the amortization outside of the corridor rule from last year's impact really? Andrew Cooper: Yes, James, so just to step back, we do have that drag now from the end of 2022 when we took into account the rapid increase in interest rates in 2022, which affects both our fixed income portfolio as well as the interest costs associated with our pension. So we have that drag which year-over-year is in the 30-some-odd range, and you see it this quarter as you've seen in prior quarters. And so one of the things we did say to the investment community is we wanted to reduce the lag associated with the pension expense and more properly reflect the test year expense because we didn't know those numbers when we filed our direct case. And so on rebuttal, as you alluded to we did file to take better account of what the testers should be based on averaging the mark-to-market end of 2021, mark-to-market end of 2022. And as you said, that's about a $20 million benefit. When it comes to the impact there, that isn't going to be something that flows through pension accounting. That's something that's going to flow through the revenue requirements and through customer charges. So that will be – if it is approved, and we're going to continue to advocate for it through the case, staff did not express support from it and there's a remodel testimony, but it's something we're going to continue to push for. That would just be reflected in the revenue requirement like everything else. However, at the same time as we do every year, at the end of the year, we're going to have to reevaluate our pension expenses based on expected market returns where discount rates are at that point. And what may, as you said, pass through the corridor and be considered material from the perspective beginning to amortize. But the drag from 2022 will remain, and the key is to reduce regulatory lag on the recovery of that through the adjustments and normalization requests that we made on rebuttal. James Ward: Got it. Perfect. Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate the color. Andrew Cooper: Sure. Thanks James. Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is live. Dariusz Lozny: Hey guys, its Dariusz back on. Just one quick follow-up, if I could. I just wanted to ask about the change in your guidance relative to the effective tax rate. It looks like it ticked up a little bit. And now there's a band versus previously it was a point estimate. Just wondering what drove that? Andrew Cooper: Yes. It did, Dariusz very perceptive. So what happened is in the first quarter, when we set guidance slightly below 11% effective tax rate now we're at this 12% to 12.5%. And when – if you recall, when we set that lower effective tax rate, it was based on our anticipated in-service date of projects that generate production tax credits, namely the [indiscernible] (0:29:52) project, and so the higher tax rate now reflects our better estimate of the in-service date of the project. Dariusz Lozny: Okay. Great. Thanks so much for clarifying. Andrew Cooper: Yes. Thanks Dariusz. Operator: Thank you. That completes our Q&amp;A session. Everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.]"

(Photo: JIm Allen/FreightWaves)A pair of unrelated statements Friday on freight rail leadership transitions underscore the push and pull of leadership dynamics of the industry.CSX’s executive vice president of operations to departJamie Boychuk, executive vice president of operations for eastern U.S. Class I rail carrier CSX, is leaving, the company said Friday.CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) didn’t specify when his last day would be, but the railroad thanked Boychuk for his six years of contributions to the company as well as his role in implementing scheduled railroading.CSX is searching for Boychuk’s successor both internally and externally. In the meantime, two CSX executives will be helping out and reporting to President and CEO Joe Hinrichs. They are Ricky Johnson, senior vice president of transportation, and Casey Albright, SVP of network operations and service design.Johnson has over 30 years of industry experience, including 22 years at CSX, and oversees all field operations. Albright has been with CSX for 25 years and seeks to ensure fluid traffic flow across CSX’s network. He also oversees the design of service plans, according to CSX.“CSX has an experienced operations leadership team that helped guide our operational transformation into a top-performing transportation company, and who will continue to implement and strengthen the scheduled railroading guiding principles that have been the foundation of our success,” Hinrichs said.“Our seasoned operations leadership team and talented field leaders will remain focused on executing our proven operational plan and drive growth by providing an ever-improving service product to customers. I have the highest confidence in our entire ONE CSX team, which has embraced our culture of working collaboratively to deliver strong safety and service results, positioning us to continue providing enhanced value for our shareholders and other key stakeholders.”Boychuk’s departure comes after the announcement of another imminent departure — that of outgoing Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) President and CEO Lance Fritz. Jim Vena is slated to become UP’s new CEO on Aug. 14, while Beth Whited, current executive vice president for strategy and sustainability, will become president.Story continuesAny speculation that Boychuk could move to UP is probably unfounded because Boychuk may have to sign a lengthy noncompete agreement before leaving CSX, which is standard for the industry, according to a Friday research note from Deutsche Bank transportation analyst Amit Mehrotra. Furthermore, similar leadership changes have occurred in the industry within a year after a new CEO has been appointed, he said, and Hinrichs was appointed last September.“COO Boychuk is extremely well regarded by the investment community and otherwise, and has led a major transformation of CSX’s operating tempo to what we regard as now being the best in the industry. … The bottom line is we would expect CSX shares to be a bit weak today on the back of this announcement, but we don’t see any lasting impact given CSX’s deep bench of talent and results-driven culture. We could see some strength on UNP shares today, but we think it’s unlikely to see any announcement in this regard given a likely lengthy non-compete agreement” signed prior to leaving CSX, Mehrotra said.Rail shippers urge Biden to renominate STB’s Oberman and FuchsWhile leadership changes are happening at CSX and UP, rail shippers want leadership at the Surface Transportation Board to remain the same.The Rail Customer Coalition (RCC) informed FreightWaves on Friday that it sent a letter to President Joe Biden this week asking him to renominate STB Chairman Marty Oberman and STB member Patrick Fuchs because some longstanding proceedings before the board still need to be resolved, including proceedings looking into the implementation of shipper-friendly initiatives, such as reciprocal switching. Shippers have been arguing that reciprocal switching, which is giving access to a competing railroad at an interchange point, could improve rail competition, particularly for captive shippers.Oberman, Fuchs and other members of the board have also initiated several hearings throughout their tenure to examine the issues related to rail competition, the group said.“Strong leadership from the STB is needed now more than ever to ensure that the Board addresses freight rail problems in a timely manner and heads them off before they become full-blown crises. A reliable and responsive rail network is necessary for national security and the U.S. economy. We urge you to renominate Chairman Oberman and Board Member Fuchs so the STB can continue to move the country’s freight rail policies forward.”RCC’s membership consists of dozens of trade associations representing manufacturing, energy and other industries, and the group estimates that its membership provides more than 7 million jobs and more than $4.8 trillion in economic output.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Railroads reach deals with unions on sick leave, conductor trainingCSX continues to target truck-to-rail conversionsRail unions urge Biden to keep current STB chair at helmThe post CSX exec to depart; rail shippers urge renomination of STB members appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Declining fuel costs represent a tailwind as far as bottom-line growth is concerned.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services. While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Deciding the Industry's OutlookDecline in Oil Price is a Tailwind: The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil prices declined 6.6% in the April-June period. As fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, the fall in oil prices bodes well for the bottom-line growth of railroad stocks.Dividend Hikes Signal Financial Bliss: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies, are reactivating shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. For example, in 2023, CSX raised its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty Continues:  Although favorable symptoms of easing inflation have brought some relief to U.S. stock markets, the recent rate hike remains a concern. The Fed reinitiated its interest rate hike process in the July FOMC meeting after taking a breather in June. On Jul 26, 2023, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25%-5.50%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1.6% on a month-on-month basis in June 2023. In fact, the index has declined month on month in four out of the first six months of the year. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operatorsZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Prospects The Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #222.

SKX appears commendable on the back of its robust business strategies. The company remains focused on boosting the omnichannel capabilities by expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business and enhancing its international foothold. SKX has been making strategic investments to improve its worldwide infrastructure, primarily e-commerce platforms and distribution centers. Continued global demand for its comfort technology footwear is also yielding results.These strengths have aided the company post sturdy results for second-quarter 2023, with the top and bottom lines outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Results gained from strength in brands and demand for comfort technology products, aided by solid marketing and distribution capabilities.Also, continued broad-based strength globally, mainly in the DTC unit, further drove the performance. We note that sturdy demand for comfort technology footwear, enhanced in-store product availability and effective demand creation resulted in 29% growth.Markedly, shares of this footwear leader have appreciated 21.7%, outperforming the industry’s 9.9% decrease in the past six months. This upside run is buoyed by the aforesaid tailwinds.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s Dive DeeperSkechers has been directing resources to enhance its digital capabilities, including augmenting website features, mobile applications and a loyalty program. Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are likely to drive greater sales. The company has updated its point-of-sale systems to better engage with customers, both offline and online. Initiatives such as “Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store” and “Buy Online, Pickup at Curbside” are worth mentioning.The company has concluded the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor. We note that the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor has helped Skechers build its brand in the Nordic region with stores and e-commerce platforms, and a network of wholesale customers in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.Management also remains focused on store expansion. In the second quarter of 2023, management opened 50 company-owned stores while closing 39 stores. Store openings consisted of 28 in China, eight of which were transferred from franchise to company-owned, eight big box stores in the United States, and three each in Chile and Vietnam. Also, it added 56 Skechers outlets in four Nordic countries and two stores in Germany from the acquisition of the company’s Scandinavian distributor.Story continuesThird quarter to date, the company has introduced two company-owned stores in the United States, and one each in Colombia and Chile. For the rest of the year, it intends to open 90-100 company-owned stores worldwide.Furthermore, Skechers’ international business remains a significant sales growth driver. SKX is poised to enhance its global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and joint ventures. In the last reported quarter, international sales increased 17.9% year over year, accounting for 60% of the overall sales for the quarter.What Else?For 2023, management believes to accomplish sales between $7.95 billion and $8.1 billion, compared with the earlier view of $7.9-$8.1 billion and $7.44 billion recorded last year. It envisions earnings per share (EPS) between $3.25 and $3.40 versus the prior expectation of $3.00-$3.20 and $2.38 delivered last year. Management expects the acquisition of the Scandinavia distributor deal to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2023. The company looks forward to achieving its goal of $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Skechers’ 2023 sales and EPS is currently pegged at $8.1 billion and $3.32 each, suggesting respective growth of 8.3% and 39.5% from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. For 2024, the consensus estimate for sales and EPS stands at $8.9 billion and $3.89 each, indicating corresponding increases of 10.3% and 17.1% from the prior-year reported numbers.To wrap up, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is likely to continue performing well on the back of such sturdy endeavors.

161,f6d595d1-bc03-3bef-9c05-ffd364c277fc,RCL,2023-08-05,Royal Caribbean Cruises and Royal Gold's have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruises-royal-golds-115800697.html,1691150280,STORY,"['RGLD', 'RCL', '^GSPC', 'F', 'GOOGL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 4, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL as the Bull of the Day and Royal Gold's RGLD asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford Motor F, Alphabet GOOGL and Block SQ.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Among the consumer discretionary sector, Royal Caribbean Cruises stock is standing out with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and lands the Bull of the Day.Royal Caribbean's stock continues to gain steam with this summer's peak travel season boosted by pent-up demand following the pandemic. This was reconfirmed in Royal Caribbean's second quarter results last Thursday with the company impressively surpassing top and bottom-line expectations and raising its full-year EPS guidance. Q2 Review Driven by stronger pricing in correlation with higher demand, Royal Caribbean beat Q2 earnings expectations by 15% last week. Earnings came in at $1.82 per share compared to EPS estimates of $1.58.More importantly, the company's post-pandemic rebound now looks in full swing after posting an adjusted loss of -$2.08 a share in the prior-year quarter. On the top line, Q2 sales of $3.52 billion surpassed estimates by 4% and soared 61% from a year ago.It's also noteworthy that Royal Caribbean has now surpassed earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters.Higher Guidance Strong Q2 results led to Royal Caribbean raising its full-year fiscal 2023 EPS guidance by 33% to between $6.00-6.20 a share. This makes Royal Caribbean shares very attractive as earnings estimate revisions should keep going up and are widely considered the most significant catalyst in the upward price movement of a stock.The Zacks Consensus for Royal Caribbean's FY23 earnings has already soared 19% over the last week to estimates of $5.63 per share compared to $4.73 a share seven days ago. Fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have climbed 7% over the last week and are now expected at $7.70 a share compared to $6.93 per share a week ago.Story continuesStellar Performance Correlating with the reassuring trend of rising earnings estimates throughout the year, Royal Caribbean stock has now soared +112% in 2023.This has largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Norwegian Cruise Line's +41% while being roughly on par with Carnival Cooperation's +117%.Royal Caribbean stock has wiped away any losses from the pandemic and is now up +113% over the last three years. This also tops the broader indexes, Norwegian's +35%, and Carnival's +28%. Despite this year's impressive rally, Royal Caribbean's stock still trades very reasonably at 18.6X forward earnings which is attractively below its industry average of 29.5X and the S&amp;P 500's 21.2X.TakeawayFollowing strong Q2 results last week, the rally in Royal Caribbean stock may accelerate this year. Earnings estimates have continued to soar and the company's P/E valuation is also supportive of the rally gaining more steam even with RCL shares up over +100% in 2023.Bear of the Day:Landing a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day, investors may want to be cautious of Royal Gold's stock for the moment.This is not to say that Royal Gold won't be a viable investment among the basic materials sector in the future. However, the current business environment is weakening for the precious metals stream and royalty company.To that point, the Zacks Mining-Gold Industry is currently in the bottom 26% of over 250 Zacks industries. Royal Gold could be susceptible to a potential slowdown in the space and the company's Penasquito mine remains closed following union strikes.Valuation Concerns Amid a softening business environment, the premium being paid for Royal Gold stock is more concerning. Royal Gold currently has an ""F"" Zacks Style Scores grade for Value.Royal Gold's price-to-earnings valuation is less reassuring right now. Shares of RGLD trade at a 31.3X forward earnings multiple which is noticeably above the industry average of 20.8X and the S&amp;P 500's 21.2X.More concerning is the premium being paid for the company's price to sales. Investors are paying $10.96 for every $1 of sales Royal Gold makes. This translates into a P/S ratio of 10.9X compared to the industry average of 3X with the optimum level being less than 2X. Royal Gold also trades alarmingly above the benchmark's 3.9X sales.Declining Earnings Estimates Declining earnings estimates are the reason for Royal Gold's less attractive P/E valuation at the moment. This is also reason to believe Royal Gold's stock may have some short-term weakness ahead.Notably, fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have declined -8% over the last 30 days from $3.93 per share to $3.61 a share. Furthermore, FY24 earnings estimates are down -6% over the last month.Bottom Line Royal Gold's stock look's less attractive considering the premium investors are paying relative to its peers.This is compiled by the Mining-Gold industry dealing with a softening business environment at the moment which serves as a further warning that it could be time to sell Royal Gold stock.Additional content:Forget August's Notorious Past, Instead Buy 3 Growth Stocks Wall Street, time and again, witnessed bouts of volatility in August, which easily disrupted the stock market's blockbuster performance in the first seven months of this year.However, the underlying strength in the economy and a possible rate hike pause are largely expected to boost the stock market this August. This calls for investing in growth players like Ford Motor, Alphabet and Block.August: Bad Month for Wall StreetMajor bourses in the United States recently registered their strongest seven months to begin a year in decades. Per Dow Jones Market Data, the broader S&amp;P 500 witnessed its best first seven-month period in a year since 1997, while the tech-laden Nasdaq wrapped up its strongest performance in the same period since 1975.But August is here, and that could mean trouble for Wall Street. Lest we forget, the S&amp;P 500's seven-month winning streak in the year 2021 stopped in August. Morningstar reported that August has been the worst-performing month for stocks since 1986. The month, in reality, marks a volatile period as market participation reduces, leading to lower trading volumes.So far this August, stocks have hit a selloff after Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term rating for the United States. The debt ceiling turmoil in Washington compelled Fitch to downgrade the United States to AA+ from AAA. The rating agency forecasts the debt burden in the United States to escalate soon and expects a fiscal deterioration in the next three years.Things May Not Be the Same This AugustDespite a discouraging start to August, investors are betting on a market revival as they believe the U.S. economy may not slip into a downturn. After all, the second-quarter GDP numbers came in stronger than expected, while orders for durable goods improved in June. To top it, the real-estate industry recently declared that the housing recession has ended.Meanwhile, retail inflation came in at 3% on a yearly basis in June, way below the 9% peak it touched last year. The slowdown in the prices of indispensable commodities may now force the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive with its monetary policies.The CME FedWatch Tool at present shows that 82.5% of market pundits expect a rate hike pause in September, as was done in the June meeting. Needless to say, a rate hike pause bodes well for stocks vis-à-vis the economy since it improves consumer outlays, and curtails borrowing costs.3 Best Growth Stocks to Own in AugustUnlike its notorious past, things are surely looking up for the stock market this August. Astute investors, thus, should shrug off the temporary dip in the market and instead place bets on solid growth stocks to boost returns in the near future.These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Ford Motor is one of the leading automakers in the world. An impressive vehicle lineup, including F-series trucks and SUV models, is expected to boost Ford's top-line growth. Ford's ample liquidity position is expected to help the company in further investments.F has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford's current-year earnings has moved up 17.8% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9%. Ford's estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 7%.Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Momentum in its cloud business and efforts to strengthen its position in the growing wearable space should improve Alphabet's profit margin.GOOGL has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alphabet's current-year earnings has moved up 4.3% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.7%. Alphabet's estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 15.3%.Block provides financial and marketing services through its all-inclusive commerce ecosystem that aids sellers to begin, run and grow their businesses. Its ever-expanding customer base, coupled with strong Cash App engagement, is benefiting Block, formerly known as Square.SQ has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block's next-year earnings has moved up 0.9% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 69%. Block's estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 20.2%.Shares of Ford Motor, Alphabet and Block have gained 12.1%, 45.5% and 18.5%, respectively, so far this year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

162,54c5da2d-332f-375b-8945-5ec94b30614d,RCL,2023-08-05,3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks to Buy Amid Fitch-Induced Selloff,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-momentum-anomaly-stocks-buy-114600303.html,1691149560,STORY,"['RCL', 'NVDA', 'GE']","[The short-term equity market rally ran out of steam last week as market correction pulled back the growth momentum and triggered a mini slide. Despite signs of a resilient economy with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising 2.6% in the second quarter, moderating inflation with the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by a quarter percentage point, and solid corporate earnings, the markets appeared to be under “constructive rotation”.The downtrend was further hastened over the past couple of trading sessions with credit rating agency Fitch trimming the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years”. However, investors have broadly taken the decline on a positive stride as fundamental views about the economy, in general, remain relatively strong.With uncertainty becoming the norm, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like General Electric Company GE, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.Story continuesScreening ParametersPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three of the 10 stocks that made it through this screen:Founded in 1892, General Electric is headquartered in Boston, MA. Its products and services range from jet engines, airframes and energy production solutions to offshore wind turbines, technologies in medical imaging and leasing and financing services, among others.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Amphenol's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Amphenol How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amphenol is:25% = US$1.9b ÷ US$7.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Amphenol's Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Amphenol has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Amphenol's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Amphenol's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 16% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Amphenol fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Amphenol Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 25% (implying that the company retains 75% of its profits), it seems that Amphenol is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Besides, Amphenol has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 27%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Amphenol's future ROE will be 23% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Amphenol's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), ICICI Bank Limited (IBN) and MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Verizon have declined -11.8% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s decline of -13.0%. The company’s continued retail prepaid and postpaid net losses are hindering its top-line growth. Stiff competition from other major players and saturation in the U.S. wireless market is hurting profits.Heavy spending on promotional activities to attract customers is also weighing on margins. It has reiterated its soft guidance for 2023 due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, Verizon is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum.It is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans that has led to solid customer additions. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products are tailwinds. Healthy traction in wireless business augurs well.(You can read the full research report on Verizon here &gt;&gt;&gt;)ADRs of India's ICICI Bank have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past six months (+14.1% vs. +5.4%) reflecting the favorable growth outlook for the country. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Jun 30) results show higher revenues, robust loans and deposit balance and a rise in provisions. Increased dependence on domestic loans, a rise in retail loan demand, higher interest rates and a stable funding base are expected to support the company's financials.Furthermore, efforts of digitizing banking operations will help generate non-interest income, thereby supporting revenue growth. However, weak asset quality remains a major near-term headwind. Macroeconomic concerns, including high inflation across the globe, make us apprehensive.Moreover, elevated operating expenses, mainly on the back of technology investments and ongoing branch expansion initiatives, will likely impede the bottom-line growth.(You can read the full research report on ICICI Bank here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Argentina-based MercadoLibre have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. -3.5%). The company’s revenues were driven by accelerating commerce and fintech revenues. Increasing total payments volume (TPV), courtesy of the robust Mercado Pago, aided the company.MercadoLibre’s rising gross merchandise volume (GMV) remained another positive. Strong shipment growth also contributed well to the reported results. MercadoLibre is benefiting from strength in its commerce and fintech businesses. Further, robust mobile-point-of-sale business and growing adoption of MercadoPago are driving the TPV.Also, rapid adoption of Mobile Wallet remains a positive. Shares have outperformed the industry year to date. However, mounting expenses related to warehousing, free shipping subsidies and mPOS discounts are major concerns.(You can read the full research report on MercadoLibre here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

At Air Products, we have an excellent and resilient industrial gas business, that is the foundation of who we are and what we do. We supply customers in dozens of industries. Customers would depend on our people's expertise to make their products and processes more efficient and sustainable. We have been doing this for the last 83 years, and we will continue to do all we can to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the Board, providing outstanding service to our customers. But at the same time, we are using all of our experience, financial strength, and core competencies as the Board's leading supplier of hydrogen. We'll implement our low and zero-carbon hydrogen megaprojects around the world. When it comes to generating a cleaner future now, we want to lead the way, decarbonizing heavy-duty transportation and heavy industry around the world, with clean hydrogen at very larger scale. This combination is our growth strategy, and it is the path forward for our continuous success and profitable growth in the quarters and years to come. I want to thank the hardworking and talented team at Air Products, we make all of this possible. Now please turn to Slide number 3, our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. We have worked hard to realize significant progress since 2014, but we always drive and strive to do even better. Our goal is to achieve zero incidents and zero accidents. Now, please turn to Slide number 4, which summarizes our management philosophy. We have shown you this slide every time that we have an earning call. But I cannot emphasize enough our commitment to the basic principles delineated in these slides. These principles will guide our actions in the future. Now please turn to Slide number 5. Our third-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.98 per share improved $0.40 or 16% versus last year and exceeded the top end of our guidance for the quarter. Both price and volume were again positive. We continued to demonstrate significant pricing strength while our volume improved for the ninth consecutive quarter, driven by strong onsite performance, including improved hydrogen demand in Americas and over 30 new assets that we have brought onstream. Additionally, we anticipate the recently announced $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas-to-syngas facility in Uzbekistan and the new LNG sale of equipment projects will add significantly to our future earnings. As you can see on this slide, we have delivered an average of 11% cumulative average growth rate of earnings per share in the last nine years. Now please turn to Slide number 6. We are committed to rewarding our investors by providing a healthy dividend and return cash to them. We are proud of our record of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increases. We expect to return more than $1.5 billion of dividend to our shareholders in 2023 and also this slide demonstrates that we have increased our dividend by an average of 10% in the last nine years. Now please turn to Slide number 7, which shows our EBITDA margin. This continues to be my favorite chart. This graph is self-explanatory and clearly demonstrates the significant improve of our margins as compared to nine years ago when I had the honor and privilege of becoming the Chairman, President, and CEO of Air Products. Now please turn to Slide number 8. I would like to again highlight the two fundamental pillars of our growth strategy. Our resilient core industrial gas business and the low-and zero-carbon hydrogen projects, the mega projects each underpinned by sustainability. By running our existing business efficiency every quarter, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in eight of the last quarters. And we continue to advance our blue and green hydrogen projects to help decarbonize the transportation and the heavy industrial sector of our economy. We expect these world-scale green hydrogen project to significantly add to our already strong profit stream in the future. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa? Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi has said, the consistency and resilience of our business was on full display this quarter. Price and volume gained 4% and 3%, respectively, at all profit metrics were up again double-digits over last year in a difficult environment. Thanks to the people of Air Products for your continued commitment to serving our customers around the world. We are proud that our NEOM Green Hydrogen joint venture, the world's largest green hydrogen production facility achieved financial close in May. The joint venture successively secured over $6 billion of non-recourse financing from over 20 global project finance leaders. The project was two times over-subscribed, a clear demonstration of confidence in this project. Now please turn to Slide 9, for our view of our third quarter results. In comparison to last year, volume increased 3%, driven primarily by our on-site business. Merchant price was 10% higher compared to last year, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This equates to a 4% price gain for the total company, with positive pricing across all regions. Declining natural gas costs in Europe and the Americas reduce energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers. This 11% decline in sales had no impact on profit but had a positive impact on margins. The overall impact of currency was modest however, Asian currencies were particularly weaker and contributed to slightly unfavorable currency impact against the U.S. dollar. EBITDA improved 12%, as strong price and equity affiliate income, including the contribution from the second phase of the Jazan project, that closed in January, more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin jumped almost 600 basis points, with lower energy cost passthrough, accounting for two-thirds of the margin improvement. ROCE progressed steadily to reach 12%, which is a 130 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects onstream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.6% this quarter. Sequentially, favorable volume and price net of variable costs drove improvement to the EBITDA and EBITDA margin, lower energy cost pass through also benefited EBITDA margin by about 200 basis points. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our third quarter GAAP earnings of $2.67 per share included two non-GAAP items that together negatively impacted EPS by $0.30 per share. First, we recorded a $0.23 charge for business and asset action. Second, the non-service components of our defined benefit plan resulted in a $0.07 cost this year versus a $0.03 gain last year. Excluding these non-GAAP items, our third quarter adjusted earnings was $2.98 per share up $0.40 or 60% compared to last year, driven by strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income. Price and volume and costs added $0.34 to our third quarter adjusted earnings. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.52 this quarter, and volume - improvement contributed an additional $0.09. Costs were unfavorable $0.27, driven by inflation, as well as our ongoing efforts to support our growth strategy, including bringing new bringing new assets on stream. Equity affiliates' income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of Jazan project, and good results from our other unconsolidated joint ventures in the Americas and Europe. The remaining items, including non-controlling interest, interest expense, and non-operating income and expense together had a minus negative $0.06 impact. We expect our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%. Now please turn to Slide 11. Our ability to steadily grow distributable cash flow, especially in challenging conditions, is a hallmark of the strength and stability of our businesses and underpins our divided and capital deployment programs. Over the last 12 months, we have generated about $3.2 billion of distributable cash flow or over $14 per share. We prioritized over 45% of - or about $1.5 billion as dividends to our shareholders, while still having roughly $1.8 billion to invest for growth. Now please turn to Slide 12. We have made significant progress in developing or deploying our capital since 2018, committing most of our estimated investable capacity available in 2018 to the 2027 timeframe. Because our strategy related to the energy transition extends well beyond 2027, We have revised this slide to show a rolling 10-year time horizon. We have not changed any other assumptions or calculations. We remain committed to maintaining our current targeted AA2 rating with our strong cash flow and additional debt leverage, we estimate that we can put more than $30 billion to work over the next 10 years. Today, we have an $18 billion backlog with $11 billion of projects focused on the energy transition. We believe that investing in these high return projects is the best way to create long-term shareholder value. Now to begin the review of our Business segment results. I'll turn the call over to Dr. Serhan. Samir Serhan: Thank you, Melissa. During our fiscal third quarter, we again saw broad-based improvements across our businesses, extending the positive trend from previous quarters. Results improved in each of our regional segments versus last year, driven by strong price, strong volume, productivity actions, despite the challenging operating conditions around the world. Before I discuss the results of each region, I would like to provide a brief update on our major projects. First, turning to Slide 13. You will see that, we have enhanced how we present our major projects, clarifying the project investment amounts, specifying the long-term nature of the related offtake agreements, and highlighting energy transition projects. We believe this new format provides a clear overview of key projects in our backlog and provide near-term and long-term visibility. Now please turn to Slide 14. I'm pleased to say that the Jiutai gasification project is in operation. Our team executed the project in the midst of COVID lockdown and supply chain disruption, including several months of severe lockdowns during the start-up period. We were able to complete, this complex project with outstanding safety performance and come in under budget. The team of over 3,300 workers during peak construction completed nearly 13 million hours without a lost time incident. I would like - to thank the team for a job well done. Our team in the America has also overcome many challenges to execute the Gulf Coast ammonia project, which had nearly 1,300 workers during peak construction and completed over a 3 million hours without a lost time incident. The facility is currently in a start-up and we expect to begin delivering hydrogen to our pipeline system this month. Finally, following many years of hard work, we announced the $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas-to-syngas plant in Uzbekistan. As part of one of the most advanced energy plants in the world. This acquisition include the two largest auto-thermal reformer in the world in short ATR. This is the same ATR technology, we're deploying in our net zero energy complex Edmonton, Canada. This will further enhance our industry leading hydrogen production capabilities driven by our own partial oxidation technology in short POX, P-O-X. This is the technology, we have acquired from GE several years ago. This POX technology which we are deploying in our clean energy complex in Louisiana has been a proven mainstay for efficient syngas generation for many decades. We will operate multiple POX units at the Louisiana facility, each of which will be the world's largest. POX and ATR are the two leading processes for the production of a blue hydrogen. Having the capability and the flexibility to use both leading technology to produce a blue hydrogen at world scale will further extend our leadership in low carbon hydrogen production. Now please turn to Slide 15. For a review of our Americas segment's results. Compared to last year, Americas EBITDA was up 18% driven by higher price and volume. Merchant price improved 11%, which corresponded to 4% improvement for the region overall. Volume grew 6%, driven by on-site including strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA margin jumped more than 1,100 basis points driven by strong price, lower energy costs pass through, which drove about three quarters of the margin improvement. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 10%, mainly on better hydrogen volume and lower variable costs. Lower energy costs pass through also drove roughly around two-thirds of the margin improvement. Now please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Asia's segment results. Our results in Asia improved despite the currency headwinds for recovery in China and higher energy costs across the region. Compared to last year, EBITDA was up 10% despite a 5% negative currency impact. Positive price and volume more than offset higher costs. Merchant price increased 9% which more than offset higher variable costs. Volume improved 8%, primarily to better onsite, including the addition of over 30 new assets in the past year. Our activities in the electronics sector [indiscernible] calendar robust accounting for many of the new projects. We also added projects in the chemical, glass, and other applications. Sequentially, volume was up 2%, following the Lunar New Year holidays. Please now turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Europe segment results. Our team in Europe has worked hard to maintain positive momentum. Compared to last year EBITDA increased more than 20%, driven by the impact of our pricing actions. Merchant price improved 10%, which equates for a - towards 6% gain for the overall region. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit merchant price gains for the region. Volume was up modestly, on better onsite. This is particularly driven by improvement in hydrogen. This more than offset weaker demand for merchant products. EBITDA margin was about 800 basis points higher and included the impact of lower energy costs pass-through, which benefited margin by around 300 basis points. Sequentially, the region's EBITDA held is steady, as favorable energy costs offset the lower price. Lower energy cost pass-through also benefited EBITDA margin by about 150 basis points. Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Compared to last year, our merchant volume and price pushed sales higher, but the increased costs negatively impacted operating income. The second phase of the Jazan project, which we closed in mid-January of this year added to our equity affiliate income, and it drove the region's overall results. The Jazan project has contributed as we expected, consistent with our commitment. Please now turn to Slide 19 for our Corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses, as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. The sales and profit for this segment were lower this quarter due to lower sale of equipment activities and higher cost resulting from ongoing support for our growth strategy. We do however continue to have robust discussions with customers interested in our LNG technology and equipment. But I'm pleased to announce two significant sale of equipment project wins with Qatargas and NextDecade. This is in addition to the two project wins announced in May. We plan to expand our production facility in Florida again and expect increasing LNG project activities to improve the segment results. Echoing what Seifi and Melissa have mentioned earlier, the outstanding results this quarter again showed the resilience of our people and our businesses. I also would like to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of our teams around the world. I would like now to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide number 20. Our third quarter results exceeded our previous guidance. However, the outlook for economic conditions around the world remain uncertain. We have again raised our fiscal year 2023 guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint of $11.40 to $11.50 earnings per share for the year versus the $11.30 to $11.50, we had provided last quarter For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share guidance is $3.04 to $3.14, up 7% to 10% over last year. We still see our CapEx for the year to be about $5 billion $5.5 billion. Now please turn to Slide number 21. The people of Air Products are passionate about helping to solve the more significant energy and environmental challenges. Their commitment and motivation continues to drive our performance. In our core industrial gases business, we are demonstrating continued strength and resiliency even against a soft economic backdrop. And we continue to bring plants online and enter a new phase where we will bring additional larger-scale projects onstream. This as a result of that, we see a great future for Air Products, and that is what makes all of us very excited about working here and being part of the global energy transition movement. At this time, we will be delighted to answer your questions. Operator? See also 25 Second Date Ideas to Get You Laid - Guaranteed and 20 Highest Rated Pilsner Beers in 2023.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Seifi, one of my emerging favorite slides is Slide 12 for what it's worth. Specifically the estimated future capacity in terms of what you can allocate the projects in the coming years. Can you - I understand this is a very fluid situation, but can you just kind of help us with the thought process around how much you believe could or will be allocated to projects oriented to the U.S. IRA? Or something along those lines, just to help us really think about the next few years on that capital allocation process? Thank you so much. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Chris. You are asking a very good question. We provided this slide to give you a 10-year view because we are at a long-term strategy and we wanted investors to get as clear a view of the future as we can provide right now. We obviously appreciate that there is a very dynamic situation about different projects in different parts of the world. So I'd like to say, that the comment that I make is based on what we know today. Based on that, I think a significant part of that investment is going to be in the United States, as a result of the IRA and the opportunities that that creates for us. But obviously, the Board is developing different people or coming up with different projects and all of that, and we participate in those. But right now I would say that a significant part of that $30 billion will be investments in the United States that we have already committed to and we will commit as we go forward. Okay, Chris? Christopher Parkinson: That's fantastic. Thank you so much. And just a very quick - as a very quick follow-up, can you just give us just a very brief overview, there is three questions. I'll take - the buy side inclusive of obviously longer-term holders, just the update on the Jazan 2 ramp, obviously, I think, I believe that started in January between that Gulf Coast Ammonia and Jiutai, those all trending basically in-line with your expectations. Just trying to compartmentalize those names as we're thinking about fiscal year '24. Thank you so much. Seifi Ghasemi: I'm just trying to make sure I understood your question because the sound wasn't that good. Christopher Parkinson: Yes. Is Jazan performing as expected? Seifi Ghasemi: I would like to have - Dr. Serhan is the Chairman of the Company, that we have formed to run Jazan, so I'd like to turn it over to him to answer the question. Samir Serhan: Yes, Chris, everything is going as it planned really since we took over the group to assets. We've been commissioning them, putting them on-stream. And really supplying the product to power to the grid and supplying also products like hydrogen to the refinery and steam. So things are really going well with that project. I mean, we're really fortunate to have a very strong 800 people doing this - running that facility. Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from David Wong with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Wong: Hi. I guess you have very strong margins this quarter in Europe. How sustainable are those margin levels, then how should we think about those going forward? Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for the question. Obviously, from my point of view, I hope it is sustainable for a very long-time. But obviously, time will tell. We as you know very well, as a matter of policy do not comment on forward pricing. We comment on, what the pricing that we have achieved, but we don't comment on forward pricing. So our goal is to maintain our margins as high as possible and create as much value for our shareholders. But it is that - I don't want to make any predictions. Dr. Serhan, do you have any additional comments on that?Samir Serhan: I mean, really the team in Europe has been doing an outstanding job. I mean, we deal with all of the challenges in Europe about the war, about energy cost fluctuation. But no doubt about it, the industrial output in Europe is not growing at all. I mean, and that is definitely a challenge that we're monitoring. But to make - I mean, some of the segments we support is better than last year. We see a gradual improvement in electronics, with some of the customers there. The low natural gas pricing, we see some of the chemical-defining fertilizer business are picking-up activity. Construction is still challenging there, which helps our package business that it's still really down compared to previous years. So, again measured costs. David Wong: Okay, thank you. And then in your corporate costs for this quarter, how much was the increase loss from lower equipment sales? And then how much was from increased investment spending? Seifi Ghasemi: I'd like to turn that over to Melissa to answer. Melissa? Melissa Schaeffer: So, thank you very much, Seifi. So just to make sure I understand your question, you're asking what was the additional contribution from our sale of equipment. David Wong: Just your corporate costs overall, it's higher than the prior year. I guess, how much was from lower equipment sales? And then how much was from increased investment spending this quarter? Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you very much. So I think you asked a great question and I will focus on cost, not just within our corporate segment, but perhaps across our organization. So a portion of our costs are really associated with our good results. We increased our variable pay program across our organization, as our results come in positively. Additionally, like most organizations, we continue to feel the burden of the wage inflation across the organization. Finally, another notable contribution is the fact that we have several plans that are pre-onstream for commissioning phases. This obviously adds to our headcount in preparation for the onstream of those plans, which will add to our cost stack for a period, without support from the program - or from the invoicing of those plants. So those three combined is really where you see the cost increase across the organization. David Wong: Okay. Thanks. Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Your increased demand that you're seeing in hydrogen, just curious which of your pipelines are you seeing that from and are these your legacy refining customers or is this from renewable fuel? And would any of those customers justify your installing some carbon capture in the near term to generate some blue hydrogen for those customers? Seifi Ghasemi: Dr. Serhan, you want to answer that? Samir Serhan: Yes. Steve, good question. We really see the demand for hydrogen, it's really significant. I mean, the main driver for us, for our business is - because you know that, we have the biggest network in the world in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That's really fully utilized. I mean, we have there more demand than we can really supply. And definitely, there is also demand for lower carbon and hydrogen for the renewable diesel refinery. So it's been really very robust, we see some activity also picking up, the hydrogen also in our Rotterdam pipeline system there. The same thing we see it in Canada, California. So it's overall really been robust, that mean the demand for hydrogen with also some buckets for low-carbon hydrogen.Steve Byrne: Okay, I'm just curious - yes. Yes. Thank you. With respect to NEOM, have you reassessed whether or not you need to invest downstream in distribution? It's been three years since you announced that project and you at that time you were thinking you would need to build some downstream pipeline capacity for the green ammonia. Do you have a view now of where you might be able to sell that green hydrogen from NEOM? Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, we do. And that we have announced some of it, and I can elaborate on that right now. We see a significant demand for that product in Europe because it is - it being very clear with the policies that has been finalized in Europe, that they were not finalized even two years ago. Europe, basically most of Europe, especially Germany has decided to go green. As a result of that, we plan to build at least three terminals in Europe. One in Hamburg, one in Rotterdam, and one in Immingham in England, to bring the product - their ammonia into those ports, associated and then sell it or mobility and for industrial applications. We might add additional terminals. In addition to that, there is a demand, a potential demand for that green hydrogen and other green hydrogen that we might make in the United States. And we are making in the United States in the State of California, because of the regulations that have been put in place, in terms of conversion to very low-emission vehicles. Therefore, the possibility and another terminal also in California. That is our current plan, but this is a dynamic situation, the regulations around the world continue changing. And as that develops, we will obviously update you. There is significant demand being generated and being discussed in Korea. It is obviously the demand for blue hydrogen in Japan and all of that. But we will update you as we go forward, but that is how we see it today. Steve Byrne: Thank you. Seifi Ghasemi: Okay? Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Roberts: Thank you. Hi, Seifi. I'll just ask one question here. When do you think we'll get the first conversion of an existing U.S. hydrogen plant from gray to blue? Seifi Ghasemi: John, that is an excellent question. I can definitely confirm that we are working on that. I do not want to predict an exact time and schedule because we are talking to customers and it is sensitive, and they don't really want us to talk about these things too much. But as you know better than anybody else, have significant number of SMRs in the United States that generate CO2, and we are very interested in capturing the CO2, from as many of them as possible. And with the help of the IRA and the demand, and the higher prices that people are willing to pay for blue hydrogen, we have a significant opportunity on that. And we will do that. Dr. Serhan, do you want to make any additional comments on that? Samir Serhan: No, it's fine. Nothing to add. Seifi Ghasemi: Thanks. John Roberts: Right. Thank you. Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John? John Roberts: Thank you. Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty: Hi, good morning, Seifi. I wanted to - Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. How are you doing?John McNulty: I'm great. I'm great. Hopefully, you are as well. Wanted to ask on the Uzbek project, that you're bringing on. I guess, I guess a couple of questions on that. Can you help us to understand, because it looks like it comes on at some point relatively early in '24, but -- so can you help us to understand the timing of it? And also the EPS contribution that you expect it to give, as you look to 2024? And then I guess also tied to that project, yes, how do you think about the returns for - I know you look for a 10% plus return, but I also know you risk adjust those as well. So, I guess, how should we be thinking about that for the Uzbek project? Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I will - I'll make some general comments and then I'll turn it over to Dr. Serhan to kind of elaborate even more in detail. But we expect that project, which is a very good project as Dr. Serhan mentioned, that project has the largest ATRs in the world and we are very happy to own it now. We expect contribution from that project in our bottom line for sure in 2024 - in our fiscal year 2024. In terms of the exact number, obviously, I can't give you the exact number, but order of magnitude, order of magnitude we expect a contribution of about $0.35 per share at least. So Dr. Serhan would you like to comment. Samir Serhan: It starts really with what is really included in this acquisition. So this is really the two largest world scale ATRs in the world. There is also a hydrogen unit through a large air separation units around 12,000 tonne per day. The plant is already built, it's in the process being commissioned right now and that's why we see it is going to be a set of our earnings next year 2024 and it would be fully in the numbers for 2025. Again, we're very proud of the project and really operating those ATRs with Haldor Topsoe technology is really going to give us lots of know-how about how to really optimize our positioning in blue hydrogen in the future. Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John? John McNulty: Got it. Perfect. No, thanks for the color. And then maybe just as the follow-up, you've got the Alberta project or Edmonton project coming on next year. It does seem like the demand for clean hydrogen is picking up in the region. Is that project sold out at this point based on the contracts that you've locked up? Seifi Ghasemi: John, on that front, we have announced, what the signing of a long-term contract with Imperial Oil, which is part of Exxon, and we have given you the details of that. The rest of it we have very clear visibility to where we are going to sell it. So I think it's a matter of semantics when you say sold out, that means contracts that have been signed and finalized for the fact that we feel that it is going to be sold out. So we feel very strongly that we will sell all of that product and we might actually need more than that. I'd like to have Dr. Serhan to make some comments about where we are on this thing and any additional color. Samir Serhan: Thanks, Seifi. IOL is the anchor customer for this project. We're working together with them to bring our respective facilities onstream. Please note the products out of this project will go into our existing pipeline systems, which we have a system in Edmonton, Canada. And this will be feeding IOL, our customers and also hydrogen for mobility because we are building a fueling station also they have to use low-carbon hydrogen for mobility. It's going very well. I mean, working very closely with IOL as the anchor customer. Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John? John McNulty: Got it. Thanks. Thanks very much for the color. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Mike Sison: Hi, good morning guys. Yes, just one question, when you think about 2024 or next year. How much earnings growth, you get some projects that are coming on-stream. And this CapEx go up next year because of you have such a big backlog of growth projects. Seifi Ghasemi: In terms of 2024, and what comes from there, I would - I appreciate if you have some patience and we will disclose that to you in - at the end of October, obviously. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But in terms of our CapEx, our expectation today is that our CapEx next year will be approximately $5 billion to $5.5 billion, the same as this year. That is based on what we know today. Okay, Mike? Mike Sison: Understood. Yes, thank you. Thanks. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Spector: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just first on the Canada Blue Hydrogen project, just the slide that you updated on the backlog, maybe has a little bit less of a discreet timing elements out there. Do you still expect that in 2024, and I guess, fiscal '24 for you guys or has anything changed there? And same thing with the SAP project, has that moved from 2025 to 2026, or is the timing relatively unchanged? Seifi Ghasemi: Well - I'd just like to - with respect to the project in Canada, as Dr. Serhan said, that project when it comes onstream, we are committed to process and supply hydrogen to IOL. So we can only do that when their plant comes onstream. But in addition to that, we do have our pipeline, we do have existing customers, who would use hydrogen, and they are increasing their demand for hydrogen. So we have the option of putting that into our pipeline. So we have a lot of different options in terms of how we help - we're going to deal with that. Dr. Serhan you want to make additional comments? Samir Serhan: No, over the year. Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. You're okay with this? Samir Serhan: Yes. Seifi Ghasemi: So that's where we're with that. Okay? Josh Spector: Yes. I guess how about the SaaS plant? And just my follow-up, I guess, on Canada would just be are you looking about the returns there as being the three-year post grant number. So the $1.2 billion or $1.6 billion. What are you basically returns off of? Seifi Ghasemi: The project costs that we have disclosed includes the brand. Correct. That means the net is - that number that we have given you minus the CAD 475 million that we will get from the Canadian government. We have given you the gross number. Josh Spector: The $1.6 billion minus the $475 million. Seifi Ghasemi: Exactly. And then with respect to the Sat plant, the Sat plant we are working on that. It is in California - and we are at the mercy of exactly when the permit will get issued. We have the air permit and all of that, but now we are working on getting the actual construction permit so that then we can start working on that project. The dates that we have given you is the best estimate that we have at this time, but that is subject to the issuance of the permit by the state of California or when we can actually start construction. Again, Dr. Serhan, any additional comments on that? Samir Serhan: The visibility we have, and we expect that by the end of the year, that we will get the construction permits. But again, it really will depend on the officials and the state of California. Okay. Josh Spector: Yes. Thanks. But just what I was asking on the Canada project was more the basis of what the returns are off. So the 10% pretax return, is that based on the net number or the gross number? Seifi Ghasemi: It's - Melissa, do you want to answer that? Melissa Schaeffer: Absolutely. So yes, thank you for the question. So there's two components of the grant. The first component is a capital grant that we are getting from the government. The second component is around a production credit. But for your specific question around where you should expect to take our normal run rate of return, it's associated to the net number, the CAD 1.1 billion that we have listed on the project side.Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Josh Spector: Thank you. Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Seifi, just one question… Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning. Mike Leithead: On your blue ammonia facility, a large fertilizer company last night paused their clean ammonia project, basically saying the costs are coming in higher and they're not seeing downstream applications develop as fast as they thought. I was hoping if you could speak to those two factors, cost and offtake agreements as it related to your projects? Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Mike, obviously, I cannot comment on what other people are saying. The blue ammonia project that we are building in Louisiana, there are many different options that we are considering in terms of the exact final scope of that project, as things develop with the markets and all of that. You know very well that, that project, we are going to make 750 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen. One of the issues for us is finalizing how much of that hydrogen we are going to put in our pipeline, and how much of that hydrogen we are going to put and convert to ammonia. That obviously makes a difference in terms of our total capital cost and all of that. I do not want to dispute the general statement that, obviously, the cost of these projects are going to be probably higher than people expected because of inflation, because of labor shortages and all of that. But we have not finalized anything yet, that is at this stage that we would want to talk about that. But, because our scope is still under definition the sequestration, how do we do the sequestration. It will make a difference whether we do the sequestration ourselves or be subcontracted to somebody. So there is a lot of moving parts. But I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Serhan to make some additional comments. Samir Serhan: Thanks, Seifi. I mean, definitely in the context of the soft global economy, global COVID pandemic, shortages in labor materials, supply chain disruptions, record inflation rate, I think we definitely at the bar sure that we can deliver. I mean, we show that on Jazan, we showed it on Jiutai. We showed that on Gulf Coast ammonia and projects that you don't really hear too many about 160 of them were closed and bought on stream during the COVID period. So I think, again, we managed to show that we are walking the talk basically and we delivered on these things. With the challenges that exist, we do see something like the inflation subsiding slowing down. But it's not going any - but we're really having the execution, basically where managing these challenges and deliver on our commitment, which is the 10% EBITDA during the contractual life of these assets. Seifi Ghasemi: I'd just like to make one additional comment. I can't help, but make the comment. As I said, I don't want to comment on what others are saying. But I do like to make a general comment that a lot of people sometimes start on this journey of blue ammonia and green ammonia, based on back of the envelope things without really understanding what they're talking about, because they have never done it before. As a result, they come up with numbers that looks pretty attractive. Then when they start actually doing the project, defining their scope and finding out the complexities, then they get surprised. So, I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, many of the people who have embarked on this energy transition would come up with realization, that some of these projects that are a lot more complex than they think. It takes a lot more. And not everybody who has never made a pound of hydrogen in their life can become a supplier of blue or green hydrogen and participate in the energy transition. We have been in this business for 60 years. We think we know what we are talking about. But anyway, I just couldn't help, but make that general comment. Okay. Mike Leithead: Fair enough. Thank you so much. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Seifi, maybe if you could, you've seen quite a few business cycles - so I'd be interested if you'd pontificate a little bit how you see Europe and China, in particular, playing out kind of the rest of this year into next year from a macro standpoint? Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you for the question, and I really appreciate the fact that you use the adjective pontificate, because that is what I continue to be doing, because - it's very difficult to see the future. But right now, the way that we are seeing right now, things developing in China and in Europe. China, we have seen some slowdown. It is not affecting our business in a significant - in a material way, but it is affecting our business. But the future is very much dependent on what the Chinese government decides to do in terms of any kind of a stimulus or not. That is very hard to predict. And obviously, we will react to that. The good thing is that a significant part of our business in China, something like 65% of it, is on-site business. So there is a lot of stability there. In terms of Europe, I hate to put it this way, but it really depends on the weather and the energy cost. Because if the weather becomes significantly core and energy costs go up, it will have a significant effect. If they become lucky like they were last year, then the effect will be less and the energy cost will stay low. But overall, it is a little bit of an unpredictable situation. That is why we, as a company, the way we deal with this, is we are very focused on productivity. And as you saw and as you heard Melissa explained, we have taken actions in terms of productivity, and we are taking a charge for that in order to make sure that we are prepared just in case things do not turn out, to be as rosy as some people are predicting. Dr. Serhan and Melissa, any additional color on this? Samir Serhan: It will be Europe is the one business or one region we have where we have significant amount of merchant, I mean, versus the other regions. So definitely, the industrial out, but not growing in Europe is a concern. I mean we see some signs of picking up, but it's still there. We don't really see it picking up full steam. China, again, we saw some recovery, but it is slowing down. I mean, we're keeping an eye on this and what type of incentives they're going to have there to really incentivize the economy. Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So I'll just add one comment specific to Europe. So, we are in a situation where we have now lapped the strong pricing momentum. So that although we are seeing a slight decrease sequentially, we still have very strong pricing in Europe. And so I think we just need to remember that lapping the comps are tougher, but it is still very strong pricing in Europe. So we need to hold on to that, to continue to show the strong returns in Europe. Duffy Fischer: Great. And maybe - Europe, in kind of switch back to the hydrogen question, obviously, you're talking to a lot of folks there, you have both blue and green hydrogen to offer. How do you see Europe playing out? How much do you think will be mandated kind of at the green level and how much will just care, is it CO2 reduced, so you can use blue hydrogen? How do you see that playing out over the next three, four or five years? Seifi Ghasemi: Duffy, that is a very good question. Right now, our best information based on discussions with customers, is that Europe is very much committed to green. That they are - that the argument is that blue hydrogen is a transitional thing. So why go through the channel - go to blue and then go to green. You know, we're going to go green, therefore, let's make the leap. And therefore, I'm sure you have seen some of the announcements with respect to, for example, the €2.2 billion that the European Commission approved for Tyson Group, that is clearly was approved for use of green hydrogen. So that is the direction we see in Europe. In Korea, in Japan, I think it will be more oriented at the beginning towards blue because that is going to be used for decarbonizing the power plants.And in the United States, we have to see, but the good news for us is that, we are seeing significant discussion on both, but that it is not as people predicted, that in the U.S. it would all be blue hydrogen. Right now we are talking to companies who are very interested in green hydrogen in the United States, to make their products in the United States, whether it's a seed or chemical. Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys. Samir Serhan: Thank you. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Duffy. Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I have one question with two parts. The first is, when I look at your results, your volumes are up 3%, your prices were up 4%. When I look at your competitor in Denbury, I think it's volumes are maybe down 1% and it's prices are up 7%. And in the different regions, it seems like your volumes are growing at a higher rate than theirs and their prices are growing at a higher rate than yours. Can you reflect on that general phenomenon? And then secondly, Air Products claims to dissociate hydrogen at a 10% loss rate rather than 20%, which is sort of the general view that people have because of the energy you need to crack the ammonia. Can you just quickly explain to us in layman's terms how you're able to have a more efficient process. Seifi Ghasemi: Very good, Jeff. And good morning, to you. Jeff with respect to comparison, you are comparing us to a company which has a different strategy and a different - so I don't want to comment on their results. You are comparing year-to-year because last year, our pricing was significantly better than the other people. So year-to-year, we are not going to show as much as an increase, because if they had a very low performance last year, this year, year-to-year, it looks better. I think that is the main reason for the price increase. And so that is my general comment on that. But overall, we are very much focused on being a green energy growth company. We are an industrial gas company and at the same time. So we are pursuing a totally different strategy, as you know I have talked before. The fact that our volumes are up, and I think this will continue to be the trend that we will beat other people on volume growth is because we are investing in the future, and we are winning our share or even better than our share of the smaller projects than people have been talking about. So as a result, volume growth is obviously the key thing we're focused on. Pricing, we are holding our own. There is no significant difference in the pricing because if it was that the market shares will change. And the market shares are staying stable. So that is the question that I have, first one. On the second question that you have in terms of the efficiency of the crackers that we think we have versus the conventional list that you use 20% to 30% of that. We have talked about this thing. It is a technology we have been developing but the person who is doing that on a day-to-day basis is Dr. Serhan and I like him to make some comments about that. Samir? Samir Serhan: I mean it really goes safely to what you mentioned before. I mean it's that know-how we developed over the last 60 years in producing hydrogen. I mean this is really what - we had this challenge a few years ago. We looked at the market, we saw that there are ammonia crackers, but the efficiency is really not acceptable. You end up wasting lots of the valuable product. And again, we put our team of expert on this. And basically, we developed a product where we feel is very, very efficient. I mean, to a single-digit loss. And that's really what we have without giving more details. I mean. Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Dr. Serhan just gave you more information, but you were saying 10% and he's not talking single digits, which is good news. But Jeff, if I may just summarize, I'm very proud of our team. We do have very good people, and they have developed this technology. And this is going to be a competitive advantage that we will end up having as we go forward on this conversion of ammonia to hydrogen. All okay Jeff? Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you very much. Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Do we have time for one more question? And please go ahead. Operator: Our last question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Haynes: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Maybe just a quick one on the fourth quarter guide. I think 4Q usually steps up a bit more seasonally than what you have baked in? I know you just kind of talked about some macro uncertainty in China and in Europe, but is there anything else in there that's causing a little bit of the more muted 4Q ramp? Thanks.Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for your question. When we give you guidance, we put touch together about what it is that we can see in terms of our best judgment of what we think we can deliver. When you look at our fourth quarter, I do agree with you that compared to seasonally adjusted results in the previous years, it seems that there is not as much of a jump as you would expect. So on that front, maybe you can tell us that we are being a little bit cautious, but we are being cautious because we are totally uncertain about some of the economies. But that is our best judgment at this time. And obviously, I certainly hope that we can do better than that. Okay? Steve Haynes: Thank you. Appreciate it. Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. That concludes our session. And I would like to again thank everyone for joining our call today. We really appreciate your interest and your good questions. And we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Stay safe. Have a great summer and talk to you soon. Take care. Thank you. Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.]"

(NYSE:CMI) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 7th of September to $1.68. This makes the dividend yield 2.8%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Cummins Cummins' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. But before making this announcement, Cummins' earnings quite easily covered the dividend. The business is earning enough to make the dividend feasible, but the cash payout ratio of 87% shows that most of the cash is going back to the shareholders, which could constrain growth prospects going forward.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 13.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 35% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCummins Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.00 total annually to $6.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Cummins has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.In SummaryIn summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The payments look okay by most measures, the lack of cash flow could definitely cause problems for them in the future. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Cummins that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

182,0b424fc0-f8ba-35b9-89db-2bb4c001a5d7,DIS,2023-08-05,It’s not just Disney losing customers—nearly 2 million people stopped subscribing to Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming service,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/not-just-disney-losing-customers-181043028.html,1691172643,STORY,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[Disney CEO Bob Iger hemorrhaged 4 million streaming subscribers in its fiscal second quarter after his company’s India-based Hotstar video platform lost the rights to Indian Premier League cricket matches.Now its David Zaslav’s turn to bleed business after his heavily criticized rebrand of Max, which involved dumping one of the most recognizable names in entertainment—HBO—when merging the respective platforms of Warner Bros. and Discovery in May.The bane of any streaming service is churn: subscribers signing up one month to take advantage of a special offer before jettisoning their membership shortly afterwards, often in favor of a rival platform. Now Warner Bros. Discovery reported on Thursday that some 1.8 million paying customers set sail for other shores in the second quarter over the preceding three months, and it’s a good bet some of those who left may have even wound up at Comcast’s rival platform Peacock.“We said we were going to build a strong, sustainable direct-to-consumer strategy focused on profitable growth as opposed to chasing subs at any cost,” Zaslav told investors.The problem for Zaslav, the most overpaid CEO in America last year according to one study, is that the bulk of those subscribers lost—roughly 1.3 million—were the more lucrative U.S. customers who generated on average $11.09 in revenue per user during the quarter versus just $3.65 for its international subscribers.“While we have seen some expected subscriber disruption, we have experienced lower-than-expected churn throughout this process,” he offered.The problem all media giants face now is the immensely profitable business model of linear broadcasting is broken because an increasing number of cable subscribers are cutting the cord so they can view content on demand rather than when a network exec decides on their behalf.Over time, the economics of the business will deteriorate, which is why Iger is considering a yard sale—possibly selling stakes in ESPN and ABC—to maximize the value while he still can.Story continuesDisney’s moment of truth next weekOffering the convenience of at-home or on-the-go streaming has been the industry’s natural answer to the shift in consumer habits. And, at least in theory, selling subscriptions comes with the added benefit of recurring revenue that is supposedly stable and predictable in an age of volatility, but in practice the economics aren’t holding up.Yet no one apart from Netflix—the first to market—has been able to escape the rivers of red ink.“We estimate they are all losing money, with combined 2022 operating losses well over $10 billion, versus Netflix’s $5 [billion] to $6 billion annual operating profit,” Netflix said in October about the competition.At least Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming division managed to nearly break even with a negligible $3 million, a half billion-dollar improvement over the previous year’s period. But the company still predicts that only its U.S. streaming business, which accounts for little more than half its streaming customers, will be profitable this year.Now streaming execs have raised the white flag in capitulation, with Disney leading the retreat.After Disney incurred over $10 billion in cumulative streaming losses since launching Disney+ in 2019, the company pledged last August to introduce a new lower-price streaming tier supported by ads. Then, in February, it unveiled $3 billion in production budget cuts.Finally Disney even announced an impairment charge of up to $1.8 billion to reflect the cost of removing shows from its streaming platform that increase the cost of its cloud hosting bills, including some of its own original programming.Investors will find out just how Disney+ is faring when the company reports fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 9. But executives already warned its streaming business will likely see operating losses widen by around $100 million over the previous quarter to around $750 million owing to a shift in the timing of marketing expenses.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

That left Friday’s OPEC+ meeting, held via a Zoom hook-up, uneventful.To make it merrier for oil bulls, Russia chirped in on the Saudi announcement on Thursday, saying it would shed 300,000 barrels per day from its exports. But traders surveyed by Investing.com expressed little faith in the Russian pledge, given Moscow’s relatively low truth-score in almost everything.While the momentum in WTI suggested it could ride till $86 until serious resistance got it, the rally could reach exhaustion earlier, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“WTI has the appearance of an overbought market although its 4-Hour Stochastics still have room for upside, with open targets for the 100-day SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $85.45 and the monthly Middle Bollinger Band of $86.90,” said Dixit, who’s chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“But a correction towards $78.70 will provide much needed energy for a renewed rally in WTI. A close below the 5-day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, of $81.45 will be an initial sign of exhaustion.”Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil up 6th week on Saudi cuts gambit; Charts show overbought marketLake Titicaca drying up as heat wave turns winter upside downOil up nearly 2% on supply cuts; set for 6th straight weekly gain]"

Robust pricing initiatives have been vital in boosting sales for industry participants. The companies remain focused on digital commerce growth, product innovation and brand building strategies.Nevertheless, the companies continue to toil with headwinds related to higher manufacturing and logistic costs, increased commodity costs, and lower volume. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending have been denting profitability. Companies like Unilever PLC UL, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. CHD, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG and Colgate-Palmolive CL have resorted to cost-curtailment actions to counter cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies manufacturing and supplying fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry. The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products, deodorants, and oral care items. The household category covers home care products, including laundry care, house cleaning agents, bleaching products, air care, dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items. Laundry detergent is one of the largest markets among the ones mentioned above. A few players also offer baby and feminine care items. Some companies offer pet care products. These companies market and sell products through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, distributors, wholesalers, department stores, drugstores, specialty stores, dollar stores, pet stores and websites.What's Shaping the Future of the Soaps &amp; Cleaning Materials IndustryFavorable Demand &amp; Pricing Actions: The soaps and cleaning materials industry has been experiencing revived demand trends across markets. The industry participants have been benefiting from solid demand for products and brands, stemming from continued brand relevance. Gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives are also driving organic sales for several industry players. The companies have been adopting bold pricing initiatives across markets to combat rising costs due to the persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes. The cost-based pricing actions have been boosting the margin and profitability of several industry players.Product Innovation &amp; Strategic Efforts: The companies frequently invest in product development to cater to the consumers’ changing needs. Investments in innovation, product portfolio and digital capabilities have been the key to driving companies' sales in the soaps and cleaning products space. Players have been undertaking pricing, packaging, marketing initiatives and restructuring actions, including acquisitions and divestitures. Companies also remain focused on expanding into new markets and channels. Developing products with eco-friendly and natural ingredients is another area of focus among industry players, as consumers increasingly prefer environment-friendly ingredients in their daily use items. The increase in popularity of online shopping, particularly after the pandemic, has been another key sales driver for the industry participants. This has led the companies to constantly step up their efforts in the e-commerce arena through improved delivery and payment systems. Consumer goods companies are also undertaking productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.Rising Costs a Concern: The industry participants are experiencing supply-chain disruptions, logistic issues and inflation in raw materials and other expenses, which have been weighing on their margins and profitability. Elevated manufacturing and distribution costs and increased advertising and sales promotion expenses are other factors impacting margins. Also, several companies are subject to higher SG&amp;A expenses due to increased operational costs related to salaries and bonuses and planned investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. Some players focus on cost-containment initiatives, including streamlining the supply chain and minimizing overhead costs to improve margins. Most companies are resorting to price increases to cushion their margins.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust ProspectsThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

(NYSE:PRU) Delivered A Weaker ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-130111416.html,1691154071,STORY,['PRU'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prudential Financial is:6.8% = US$2.0b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.07 in profit.Does Prudential Financial Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Prudential Financial has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Insurance industry.roeThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Prudential Financial's Debt And Its 6.8% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Prudential Financial, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.06. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

192,2cbed35d-8c12-39ca-af71-6d77168276ec,DVN,2023-08-05,Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Is Reducing Its Dividend To $0.49,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-nyse-dvn-reducing-120843216.html,1691237323,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy Corporation's (NYSE:DVN) dividend is being reduced from last year's payment covering the same period to $0.49 on the 29th of September. However, the dividend yield of 6.8% is still a decent boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy Devon Energy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Devon Energy's dividend was only 61% of earnings, however it was paying out 210% of free cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 17.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 67%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.47. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 16% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Devon Energy has impressed us by growing EPS at 49% per year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.In SummaryIn summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Devon Energy has 4 warning signs (and 2 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

201,0ed8b935-6a44-42c1-ad38-8b054a74f082,HAS,2023-08-05,The turnaround stories being overlooked by investors in 2023: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-turnaround-stories-being-overlooked-by-investors-in-2023-morning-brief-100019692.html,1691143219,STORY,"['MAT', 'NVDA', 'COOK', 'HAS', 'INTC']","[This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsA week chock-full of learnings for this writer.How about this one for starters: After seeing iconic 1980s rock band Foreigner on Wednesday night, I came away thinking my best days in life are ahead of me ... not behind me.These 60-plus-year-old guys were rocking the house like 20-year-olds and had the crowd — including yours truly — eating out of the palms of their hands. Impressive efforts on stage, which included a reminder that all of their music was being sung and not powered by AI. Bearish for AI stocks? Unclear.I also was reminded that this is one expensive stock market that is priced for perfection. And if that perfection isn't achieved, investors will pay dearly. And they paid this week, to an extent.We continue to see global markets roiled a bit from Fitch's credit rating downgrade on US debt. Pricey tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) are feeling a big brunt of the risk-off move.morning brief imageAll of this got me thinking maybe it's time for investors to find a few interesting turnaround situations to bet on. You know, well-known companies that have visible catalysts in place that investors have forgotten about amidst the summer hype for top-performing businesses.And companies whose stocks aren't as inflated as the broader market, so there is already a ton of bad news priced in.Take for instance chip giant Intel (INTC).The company has had a brutal 12 months as CEO Pat Gelsinger slashes costs, builds new chip-making plants, and tries to catch up to AMD and Nvidia on design. A post-pandemic downturn in PCs hasn't helped Intel's fundamentals either.But Intel looks to be turning the corner operationally, at least in the eyes of the energetic Gelsinger.""The worst is behind us,"" Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance Live.Story continuesThe symbol for Intel appears on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)Gelsinger thinks the PC market will gradually recover this year, and the company has secured $1 billion-plus in commitments for AI-related chips. The company also remains on track to attain $8 billion in cost cuts by 2025.This is a markedly different tone relative to when we talked a few months ago.Is Intel hitting its stride? Who knows. But the situation appears way better than two quarters ago — and it may not be priced into the stock price of this iconic American company.Another big business that may be beginning to see daylight after a tough stretch is toymaker Hasbro (HAS).Hasbro unloaded its anchor-like entertainment business eOne to Lionsgate for $500 million this week. The sale removes a non-core asset from Hasbro's books, freeing up resources to invest in core toys.This comes as Hasbro has seen stabilization in toy demand despite the juggernaut demand driver for rival Mattel (MAT) in the Barbie movie.Speaking of resources, Hasbro is on pace to remove $250 million to $300 million in costs by year-end 2025.Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks sounded pretty confident in our chat this week that his company's worst days were behind it too. Now onto some debt pay-down ($400 million) and marketing behind the red-hot-selling, Furby doll.I would even add a small-cap name like grill-maker Traeger (COOK) into this turnaround play callout. The company has gotten its inventory levels into far better shape after a rough year. Demand for grills is stabilizing, and the CEO has been refocused on driving stronger operations.""I truly believe we have turned around,"" Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told us.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Approximately a quarter of its revenue is generated outside North America.Currently, FIS's stock price stands at $59.34, while its GF Value, an estimate of fair value, is $117.85. This discrepancy raises questions about the company's true value. Let's examine the company's income breakdown for a clearer picture.Is Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS) a Potential Value Trap? A Comprehensive AnalysisA Closer Look at the GF Value of Fidelity National Information ServicesThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates.

A Comprehensive AnalysisLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of Fidelity National Information ServicesAssessing the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing in its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss. A great way to understand a company's financial strength is by looking at its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Fidelity National Information Services has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.1, which is worse than 92.55% of companies in the Software industry. The overall financial strength of Fidelity National Information Services is 4 out of 10, indicating that its financial strength is poor.Is Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS) a Potential Value Trap? A Comprehensive AnalysisProfitability and Growth of Fidelity National Information ServicesCompanies that have consistently been profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Fidelity National Information Services has been profitable for 9 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $14.6 billion and a Loss Per Share of $39.77.

Overall, the profitability of Fidelity National Information Services is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.Story continuesDavid Gibbs: Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last December, we shared our long-term vision for Yum! to deliver accelerated global growth. I am proud to say that our second quarter results are further evidenced by our ability to execute against this vision. Through Yum!’s differentiated capabilities our bold restaurant development engines including 1,025 gross new units in the current quarter, and our distinctive digital capabilities, which drove record digital sales fueled the second quarter’s 13% growth in system sales. I'm especially pleased to report that based on our strong year-to-date results and the continued momentum we see in our business, we expect to deliver full year 2023 results, well above our long-term growth algorithm.I'll cover the few high-level thoughts on our second quarter results before sharing some additional details through the lens of the relevant, easy and distinctive brands, and unrivaled culture and talent pillars of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. Chris will then provide some additional color on our second quarter results, followed by an update on our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities, Growth Pillars. For the second quarter, we delivered same-store sales growth of 9% and unit growth of 6% with KFC setting the pace with a remarkable 19% system sales growth on the foundation of our industry-leading development momentum, distinctive marketing campaigns and relevant new product layers, such as the launch of original recipe hand breaded chicken nuggets here in the US.And as I'm sure you've all heard, Taco Bell, in partnership with another global icon, LeBron James successfully liberated Taco Tuesday in a way no other brand could mimic. As we also discussed in December, our Recipe for Good Growth strategy will be powered by digital and technology. Our distinctive digital capabilities, which enable easier experiences and greater access to our iconic brands continues to unlock incremental sales through higher spend and frequency, as well as incremental profitability for our system. On that note, I'm pleased to report another quarter of double-digit growth resulting in $7 billion in digital sales, representing over 45% of our global system sales. Turning back to our Recipe for Good Growth and our iconic Red Brand, let me start with the KFC division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profit.Second quarter system sales growth of 19% was driven by 13% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. Widespread transaction growth and a strong recovery in our China market as Yum! China detailed in the results earlier this week, powered our same-store sales growth. However, even outside of China, is the global same-store sales growth was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, KFC represents our largest digital business globally on a dollar basis and showed continued momentum with strong year-over-year growth in both digital sales and mix. Among KFC's emerging Markets, I'd like to highlight our Middle East team for the work they did to drive system sales with a focus on their core menu and new snacking product offerings and the South Africa team for their efforts to grow the breakfast layer through a bold marketing campaign with Trevor and Noah.Thanks to unlocking additional customer use occasions, compelling value offerings and continued digital growth both markets posted strong same-store sales growth. Among our developed markets, Western Europe led the way with strong results in check and transactions by balancing disruptive value and core menu items. Turning to KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 5%, improving sequentially with the combination of product innovation and an always on value strategy. Building our first quarter, momentum behind wraps, KFC U.S. launched hand breaded original recipe chicken nuggets to expand its off the bone chicken offerings leveraging the learnings from our significant off the bone business at KFC International. This product innovation was met with an immediate positive consumer reaction, resulting in over 100 million nuggets sold in the first eight weeks after launch.These boneless offerings appeal the younger and new KFC customers and builds upon an already well-established sales layer following the successful launch of the chicken sandwich in 2021. Moving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our global divisional operating profit and roughly 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit. Once again, I'm thrilled to share more external recognition of Taco Bell's brand power and relevance with the brand's inclusion on the Time 100 list of the world's most influential companies. This category of One Brand remains ever relevant by pushing boundaries and introducing and reintroducing exciting and craveable menu items and always being part of the cultural moment and conversation. Congrats to the entire Taco Bell team and our incredible franchisees for yet another well-deserved honor.For the second quarter, Taco Bell's global system sales grew 7% led by 4% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Taco Bell continues to execute its magic growth formula through a balanced set of commercial strategies including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, mass occasions, and digital initiatives. This quarter, the team launched a campaign to liberate Taco Tuesday in a first-ever global Taco Tuesday, campaign spanning 19 markets in partnership with a true global icon LeBron James. The campaign created massive brand buzz with engagement, and mentions in one week for taco Tuesday Liberation surpassing the entirety of the highly successful Mexican Pizza relaunch last year. Other promotions in the quarter contributing to Taco Bell’s winning magic growth formula includes both our $5 Cravings Creo and Deluxe Build Your Own Cravings Box that help sustain our strong consumer value proposition and maintain over.25% margins. In addition an expansion of trading hours with strong growth at both the breakfast and late night dayparts, helped Taco Bell’s second quarter results. Finally, the team continues to create incremental demand for their digital channels. In the U.S., digital sales increased almost 35% year-over-year with kiosks now deployed in 100% of Taco Bell stores. Taking all of this into account, it is no surprise Taco Bell continues to be a leader in value perception, while also delivering amazing unit economics. For Taco Bell International, system sales grew 18%, driven by development momentum. The global Taco Tuesday Campaign, which launched in June and will continue through the third quarter, leverages Taco Bell's, US cultural leadership building brand equity and consumer awareness with a consistent look and feel around the world.I also want to highlight Taco Bell’s continued progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy that included raising $20 million so far this year through its Round Up fundraiser. Throughout the quarter to the Taco Bell Foundation donated these funds to over 400 non-profits and nearly 1,000 live mass scholarships. Next I'll discuss the Pizza division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 7% for the quarter, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Pizza Hut International grew system sales 11%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. The individual occasion continues to be a growth driver largely on incremental transaction growth from the Melts platform, which in the US has proven to be a self-sustaining layer at an attractive entry price point.Since launching in the U.S. late last year, Melts has now reached 35 markets, up significantly from the 11 markets in the first quarter, now in over half of our global store base. Melts is delivering encouraging early results alongside My Box, our other international individual occasion product offering. Our team is focused on providing distinctive value offerings across markets such as the Super Limo Abundant Value deal in the UAE and the National Pizza Party promotion in Australia. Pizza Hut U.S. grew system sales 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. In the U.S., we introduced new flavor profiles to our Melts platform, providing yet another reason for customers to order from Pizza Hut. The Habit Burger Grill division grew system sales 9% on 7% unit growth.The Habit team continues to lean into its menu strategy of Culinary Forward limited time offerings, highlighting its craft brand positioning through their elevated craveable offering. We continue to expand access points for our customers with the rollout of kiosks now in over 60% of stores on average kiosk sales peaked 10% higher checks, compared with front counter sales and excellent profit flowthroughs, yet another proof point of the value from converting to digital sales. Moving to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver, which continues to be the foundation of our success, to start, I'd like to recognize Taco Bell division CEO Omar King, who will retire at the end of the year as we celebrate the legacy that Mark will leave at Taco Bell we're thrilled that Sean Tresvant will become the CEO of the Taco Bell division effective January 2024.Sean joined Taco Bell's Chief Brand Officer two years ago and earlier this year, expanded his role to Global Chief brand and Strategy Officer. With Sean's clear vision and strong track record of driving transformative red innovation, I'm confident the Taco Bell will continue to successfully execute its long-term global growth strategy. This is a great reminder of how people are truly at the center of everything we do, which is also reinforced in our Global Citizenship and Sustainability report, which was published last month. The report outlines our strategic investments in socially responsible growth, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our three priority pillars of people, food and planet. I'd like to take a moment to highlight work on key issues across each pillar, including the quality, packaging, and carbon reduction.We remain committed to our purpose of unlocking opportunity in part through our $100 million commitment over five years that we announced in 2020 to knock down barriers to equity inclusions, education and entrepreneurship around the world. Through our unlocking opportunity initiatives, we have funded and activated more than 30 social impact programs in 11 countries, enabling markets to develop localized programs to deliver meaningful change in communities where we operate. We also continue to make progress towards achieving gender parity and leadership roles by 2030, with 43% of global leadership roles held by women in 2022. These are just two examples of the great progress we've made and that how Yum!’s commitment to its people first culture has never been stronger.In addition, we continue to make progress around sustainable packaging, building upon our harmonized cross-brand packaging policy that was introduced last year. Furthermore, we've had great success as we March toward our climate goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% by 2030. To-date, our teams have achieved a 57% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at corporate restaurants and offices, coupled with a 28% reduction at franchise restaurants. Reflecting on the first half of the year, our teams have put forward an impressive set of results. And looking forward, the picture we see for the second half of the year will be similarly strong. Our confidence comes from our Recipe for Good Growth strategy and the fact that category leaders Taco Bell US and KFC International drive 80% of Yum!’s divisional operating profit.The vast majority of our U.S. operating profit is driven by Taco Bell, the leading brand in both cultural relevancy and affordability, while globally, KFC is positioned with unmatched scale advantages and growth by the franchise partners eager to capitalize on opportunities in their markets and widen their competitive mode. In an uncertain environment, we know that consumers make decisions with value in line with good news is that our brands have always stood for tremendous value in addition to convenience, experience, and craveable food. This is a winning combination that will continue to differentiate us from our competitors and when coupled with our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, I am confident that we can continue to deliver on our long-term vision for accelerated global growth in 2023 and beyond.With that, Chris, over to you.Christopher Turner: Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter financial results and our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers before turning to our capital strategy. I'll begin with our second quarter results. We delivered 13% system sales growth, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Digital sales improved at all four of our brands with total digital sales up nearly 30% year-over-year. Core operating profit for the quarter grew 12%. Taco Bell store level margins were an impressive 25.6%. We continue to expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be similar to margins in 2022. Taco, Bell's ability to deliver such strong margin performance, despite mid-single-digit inflation, once again demonstrates the power and resilience of their business model and preserves their compelling unit economics, which remain near an all-time high.For Habit, company-operated margins improved to 11%, thanks to better leverage of Yum!’s purchasing scale, as well as efforts to improve store level labor productivity. We're encouraged with the margin improvement progress at Habit and we’ll continue to invest in the long-term growth of the business and as a result, we expect a small operating loss for the division this year. Ex-special general and administrative expenses $280 million, in line with our expectations. The Ex-special tax rate for the quarter was 18%. Finally, our second quarter EPS, excluding special items was $1.41 per share. Second quarter EPS was positively impacted by unrealized investment gains of $0.09, relating to our investment in Devyani, offset by a negative foreign currency translation impact of $0.05.Given our strong first half results, and continuing momentum into the second half of the year, I'm happy to report that we expect on a full year basis, to over deliver on all components of our long-term growth algorithm. We expect full year 2023 core operating profits to grow low-double-digits, which is ahead of our long-term guidance of at least 8%. We expect second half G&amp;A expenses to be modestly higher, relative to our initial plan, primarily attributable to above target incentive compensation accruals resulting from our strong performance and which we began recording in Q2. As a reminder, employee incentive compensation is tied to internal performance targets, linked to components of our long-term growth algorithm. The accrual we book throughout the year can go up or down depending on our performance.Consistent with our prior GNA guidance, we still expect our year-over-year G&amp;A growth to be lower in the second half of the year. Balance of year, we expect the third quarter year-over-year G&amp;A growth rate to look similar to the growth rate in the first half, followed by a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. Finally, we've faced a $44 million, foreign currency headwind year-to-date and our current forecast is for little to no FX impact to reported operating profit in the balance of the year. Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Developments, we opened 1,025 gross new units during the quarter contributing to 6% unit growth. We are encouraged by the excitement among our growth ready franchise partners who see broad consumer appeal for our brands and enormous white space opportunity in their markets and who are enthusiastic about Yum!’s unmatched operating capabilities.We continue to expect that the benefits of our scale and the health of our franchise system will allow us to further widen our development advantage relative to the industry. As you've heard me say before, the Yum! system is made up of world-class franchise partners who are truly 3C, Committed, Capable and well-capitalized. As a result, we expect 2023 will be another incredible year of development similar to 2021 and 2022, which were both industry record-setting years. Let me share a few highlights of our unit development in the quarter beginning with the KFC division, which opened 600 gross new unit. Yum! China's development momentum re-accelerated 375 gross new units opened this quarter, putting their year-to-date development ahead of last year's pace.The remainder of KFC's unit growth was widespread across markets, led by India, The Middle East, and Asia. As for the Pizza Hut division, the team opened 357 gross new units, led by China, India, Spain, Turkey, and the US, with each opening at least 20 units. In June, The Flynn Restaurant Group announced its first international expansion with an agreement to acquire Pizza Hut, Australia, which owns approximately 260 Pizza Hut units. This is a great example of a 3C partner eager to grow within our system. For those unfamiliar with the Flynn Restaurant Group, they are the largest franchise operator in the U.S. restaurant industry with roughly 2,400 restaurants, including nearly 300 Taco Bells and nearly 1,000 Pizza Huts. For some perspective, in 2022 Flynn accounted for roughly 20% of the Pizza Hut U.S. new builds and their overall, same-store sales growth significantly outperformed the rest of the U.S. system.Taco Bell development remains on track for another record-setting year with 63 gross new units, including 27 in international markets across eight countries. Totaling it all up, Yum!s first half unit development reflects nearly 1800 gross new units, a fantastic result that demonstrates the resilience of Yum!’s development engine, despite a more challenging macro environment. Next, I'll turn to our unmatched operating capabilities that contribute to our position as the global franchisor of choice. This includes our distinctive digital strategy to unlock improved customer experiences that lead to faster sales growth and better store level margins. With that, let me discuss the three pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences Pillar, this quarter, the KFC US team leveraged the Yum! commerce platform, which was first launched with KFC.U.S. in 2021 to enable a Diablo for limited time promotion in partnership with Activision Blizzard and offered customers exclusive in-game rewards in exchange for KFC purchases. By leveraging our in-house technology, we were able to build the necessary infrastructure and integration to support this exciting gaming promotion in a matter of weeks. Previously, the process would have taken months with significant third-party expense. This quarter, we achieved a significant milestone in expanding the Yum! Commerce platform as Taco Bell U.S. migrated its digital traffic onto the platform. All of Taco Bell's web, mobile, and Delivery-as-a-Service digital transactions are now processed through this platform. Additionally Pizza Hut Peru became the first international Market to begin using the Yum! commerce platform this quarter.We will continue to migrate additional brands and markets to the Yum! commerce platform over the coming quarters, including Pizza Hut U.S. throughout 2023 in several international markets. Within the Easy Operations pillar, we continued to expand adoption of both recommended ordering and our Yum! point-of-sale system. As you may recall, recommended ordering is an AI machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order. Recommended ordering was deployed in another 800 stores this quarter and is now live in over 4400 KFC and Taco Bell U.S. stores. Our Yum! Next-Generation Cloud First point-of-sale system improves operational efficiencies and enhances team member effectiveness.Taco Bell U.S. is leading this rollout having deployed this system to 1,000 stores this quarter and targeting 5,000 stores by year-end. Finally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we are advancing our digital strategy and using a new customer data platform solution to provide a unified view of customers across our US brands and third-party aggregators. This will enable us to improve digital experiences for our customers and ultimately increase customer frequency. Eventually, this and other internal programs will provide the infrastructure to unlock personalized marketing, joint branding and future automation. This is the latest step in our vision to One Day Achieve 100% of sales powered by digital. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position.As a reminder, our strategy is to enable growth, while maximizing shareholder value. In doing that, our capital priorities remain unchanged, investing in the business for the long-term, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, paying a competitive dividend and maximizing shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydowns and share repurchases. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $34 million, reflecting $60 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in re-franchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio declined to 4.7 times, reflecting our previously stated intention to allow net leverage to drift modestly lower this year. Keep in mind, we have an upcoming bond maturity of $325 million in November of this year, our only maturity until 2026.See also 15 Most Consumed Meats in the World and 30 Drunkest Cities in AmericaFurthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average remaining term of six years and our greater than 90% fixed floating ratio is attractive in the current market environment. We paid down $164 million on our revolver, leaving a minimal balance at the end of the quarter. We continued to evaluate the best use of our excess capital and at current interest rates, we believe funding our upcoming debt maturity before share repurchases best optimizes shareholder value. To round out our prepared remarks, I'm incredibly pleased with our strong, year-to-date results and continued momentum giving us confidence, we will deliver full year 2023 results well above our long-term growth algorithm. Our brand teams and franchise operators remain vigilant in the pursuit to maximize performance and in turn deliver exceptional shareholder value.With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

206,9e9f45f8-23ae-3f84-913e-c6a9586bc526,MCD,2023-08-05,Investors in McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) have seen stellar returns of 105% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-mcdonalds-nyse-mcd-seen-130101546.html,1691154061,STORY,['MCD'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the McDonald's share price has climbed 83% in five years, easily topping the market return of 51% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 14% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for McDonald's While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, McDonald's managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.8% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, McDonald's' TSR for the last 5 years was 105%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that McDonald's shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 15% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for McDonald's   you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

EXR reported second-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.06, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14. Quarterly revenues of $511.4 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $524.9 million.Results reflect lower-than-anticipated revenues on lower occupancy levels. Also, higher interest expenses were a dampener. The company revised its 2023 outlook.EXR shares are down more than 7% in the initial hours of trading on the NYSE today.On a year-over-year basis, while the core FFO per share declined 3.3%, revenues were up 7.7%.According to Joe Margolis, CEO of Extra Space Storage, ""We maintained strong occupancy of 94.5%, driving same-store revenue growth of 2.7% in the quarter, despite exceptionally difficult year over year comparables from pandemic highs. While property net operating income and Core FFO were both on budget in the quarter, we have revised our outlook for the back half of the year due to lower than expected new customer rates in June and July.”EXR closed its merger with Life Storage, Inc. in an all-stock transaction on Jul 20. With the completion of the Life Storage Merger, Extra Space now possesses a portfolio of more than 3,500 locations, encompassing more than 270.0 million net rentable square feet, and operating under the Extra Space, Life Storage and Storage Express brands.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 2.7% year over year to $389.5 million in the second quarter. This uptick resulted from higher average rates to existing customers and a rise in other operating income, partly muted by lower occupancy. Same-store operating expenses increased 3% year over year to $91.4 million, reflecting an increase in marketing, insurance, property taxes and office expenses.Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 2.6% year over year to $298.1 million. The same-store square-foot occupancy contracted 130 basis points year over year to 94.5% as of Jun 30, 2023. Our estimate for the second-quarter occupancy was 94.4%.In the second quarter, interest expenses significantly increased to $86.4 million from $47.5 million reported in the year-ago period.Story continuesPortfolio ActivityDuring the second quarter, Extra Space Storage acquired one operating store and two stores at the completion of construction for a total of $32.8 million.The company added 54 stores (47 stores net) to its third-party management platform. As of Jun 30, 2023, it managed 978 stores for third parties and 323 stores in unconsolidated JVs, resulting in 1,301 total stores under management.Balance SheetExtra Space Storage exited the second quarter of 2023 with $50.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, down from $92.86 million recorded as of Dec 31, 2022.As of Jun 30, 2023, EXR's percentage of fixed-rate debt to total debt was 73.4%. The combined weighted average interest rate was 4.5%, with a weighted average maturity of around 5.1 years.During the reported quarter, Extra Space Storage originated $68.6 million in mortgage and mezzanine bridge loans. It also sold $24.1 million in mortgage bridge loans.In the second quarter, the company did not issue any shares under its at-the-market program and presently has $800 million available for issuance. Also, it did not repurchase any shares of common stock and had the authorization to buy up to an additional $337 million under the plan as of Jun 30, 2023.2023 GuidanceExtra Space Storage revised its guidance for the current year.It projects core FFO per share in the range of $8.15-$8.35 compared with the prior guidance of $8.30-$8.60. This is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.51.The full-year guidance is based on the assumption of 2.5-3.5% growth in same-store revenues compared with the prior range of 3.75-5.25% and a 3.5-4.5% increase in same-store expenses compared with the prior guidance of 5-6%. Consequently, same-store NOI growth is projected in the band of 2-3.50% compared with the previous outlook of 3-5.5%.However, EXR noted that as a result of the close timing between the Jul 20, 2023 Life Storage merger and the earnings release, the company’s details on initial and revised core FFO estimates and annual assumptions for the year ending Dec 31, 2023, excludes any influence from the Life Storage Merger.Extra Space Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference will be recorded August 4. I would now like to turn the call over to Shane Kleinstein, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Shane KleinsteinThank you, and good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed by Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor with the SEC.These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband or Liberty TripAdvisor's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Broadband, including adjusted OIBDA. Information regarding the comparable GAAP metrics, along with required definitions and reconciliations, including preliminary notes in schedules 1 and 2, can be found in the earnings press release issued today as well as earnings releases for prior periods, which are available on Liberty Broadband's website.Now I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO.Story continuesGregory B. MaffeiThank you, Shane. Good morning. Today speaking on the call, we will have Liberty Broadband's Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; Ron Duncan, CEO of GCI and Pete Pounds, CFO of GCI, will also be available to answer questions. Also during the Q&amp;A, we will be available to answer questions related to Liberty TripAdvisor.So starting with Liberty Broadband. We remain under the 26% fully diluted ownership cap due to lighter buybacks and their annual issuance of equity awards at Charter. We have not sold into the buyback since January. We do plan to resume LBRDA and LBRDK buybacks using substantially all of our after-tax proceeds from Charter sales once they resume their buyback.Charter, looking at it, strong operating results, 77,000 broadband net adds and 648,000 wireless net adds benefiting from the conversion strategy of Spectrum One. Charter is now about 30% of all the postpaid industry wireless net adds and cable in total is about 47%. The rural expansion is going well at Charter, pacing with 26,000 subsidized world subscribers added. That was 1/3 of our total broadband net adds coming from the subsidized world builds.We do expect progress on the investments we've made and easing cost pressures in the back half of 2023 to really reaccelerate growth. 2023 is an investment year and we did see modest financial growth in the quarter as expected due to that. There remains pressure in the video income system, which is impacting our top line, but not impacting EBITDA as much. Charter management is executing well on all pillars of its strategy, and we are pleased with their progress. The employee retention initiatives they've undertaken approved successful with better sales yields, retention and customer service. We are on track for 300,000 rural passings constructed in 2023, and the network evolution and physical upgrade plans are on track as well. 45% of our customers are now receiving our advanced WiFi product.Turning to TripAdvisor. We believe the long-term trends and travel experiences will benefit the business and will continue. Recent growth has continued to be led by strength of experiences. Viator revenue was up 59% year-over-year. We are focused on growing the brand awareness of Viator and building a cost-efficient customer acquisition channel, which we believe is entirely doable and will continue to increase profitability over time. And we continue to evaluate ways to better highlight the value of Viator.There are -- we are working through the challenges in metasearch while carefully managing costs. TripAdvisor announced cost reductions recently, most recently targeted at the TripAdvisor core and corporate functions. We are investing in strategic initiatives to build deeper engagement with travelers and diversify our monetization schemes. We are leveraging AI, we have upgraded our trip planning tools built on trips proprietary data using AI, and we are augmenting our content offering both -- with both user-generated plus editorial content, leveraging that AI as well. And we have other initiatives underway to drive increased engagement and membership sign-in.And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for the details.Brian J. WendlingThank you, Greg. Let's take a quick look at Broadband's balance sheet. At quarter end, Liberty Broadband had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $81 million, which includes $60 million of cash at GCI. As of the end of the day, yesterday, the value of our Charter investment was $19.9 billion, and at quarter end, Liberty Broadband had a total principal amount of debt of $3.8 billion. Note that this excludes the preferred stock and remaining indemnification obligation to Qurate.As Greg mentioned, we have not sold into Charter's buybacks since January. We do expect to resume share sales to Charter at some point this year to maintain our fully diluted ownership of 26% for our stockholders agreement. However, due to less buyback activity, we would expect lower tax leakage on our future Charter sales this year compared to the previously estimated range of 7% to 9%.Taking a quick look at GCI. GCI had a solid second quarter. Revenue and adjusted OIBDA were up $7 million and $2 million, respectively. Revenue growth was driven by continued strength in data sales, particularly to RHC and school customers. This was partially offset by continued declines in our video business, which impacts revenue but does not have a meaningful impact on margin or free cash flow. Adjusted OIBDA grew less than revenue due to inflationary pressures, primarily in labor and personnel-related expenses. Over the last year, GCI has added 5,700 revenue-generating wireless subscribers and 4,000 revenue-generating cable modem customers.Solid performance has allowed GCI to continue making distributions up to Liberty Broadband. Subsequent to quarter end, GCI paid a $25 million dividend to Liberty Broadband using cash on hand, and we anticipate additional dividends will be paid this year. Year-to-date, Broadband has received $65 million in dividends from GCI. Leverage as defined in its credit agreement was 2.95x as of quarter end and GCI has $397 million of undrawn capacity under it's revolver.And then just a quick update on 2 litigation settlement matters. During the second quarter, GCI paid the previously accrued $41 million settlement to the FCC and DOJ resolving that long-standing inquiry regarding the RHC program. And additionally, during the second quarter, Liberty Broadband paid the previously accrued $38 million settlement related to a 2015 lawsuit. More information on both these matters is available in our 10-Q, which will be filed shortly.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg.Gregory B. MaffeiThank you, Brian. And to our listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor. Our Annual Investor Day will be Thursday, November 9 in New York City. Please save the date, additional details will be provided soon. We hope to see many of you there. And with that, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.Michael Ian RollinsJust curious on the Liberty Broadband side, any new perspectives on the opportunity for Liberty Broadband to close some of the NAV discount relative to the value of the Charter stake and the other assets, GCI and the other assets that you own?Gregory B. MaffeiYes. Thank you for the question. Look, we are always interested in trying to maintain the smallest discount possible, but when presented with the discount, we are going to try and take advantage of it. And we believe with the cash flows that we are going to be generated from Charter to us, we will be able to repurchase shares at an attractive rate. Over the long term, we'll see how that narrows and when becomes most logical as it probably will at some point to combine Liberty Broadband at Charter, but we have no current plan or intent.Operator, I believe we have no more questions. So with that, again, thanks to our listening audience. Appreciate your interest in Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor. We hope to see you next quarter, if not sooner. Thank you.OperatorThank you. All parties may disconnect.]"

Rowe Price Group TROW, SEI Investments Co. SEIC and Artisan Partners Asset Management APAM.Industry: Investment ManagementLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2131856/3-stocks-from-the-prospering-investment-management-industryThe high interest rate environment is expected to keep supporting revenues for the Zacks Investment Management industry stocks. While the continued shift in investor preference toward passive investing may weigh on margins to some extent, higher rates will aid margin growth.Amid the pandemic-induced uncertainty, investment management companies benefited from higher volatility and client activity. Despite the current subdued market volatility, investment managers are expected to witness growth in their assets under management (AUM) balances because of asset inflows. Thus, firms like T. Rowe Price Group, SEI Investments Co. and Artisan Partners Asset Management will benefit.About the IndustryThe Zacks Investment Management industry consists of companies that manage securities and funds for clients to meet specified investment goals. They earn by charging service fees or commissions. Investment managers are also called asset managers, as they manage hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital and other financial investments for third parties. By appointing an investment manager for one's assets, investors get more diversification options than they would have if they managed their assets by themselves.Investment managers invest their clients' assets in different asset classes, depending on their needs and risk-taking abilities. Hence, the diversification, which investors get by appointing asset managers to manage their assets, helps reduce the impact of volatility and ensures steady returns over time.3 Investment Management Industry Trends to Keep an Eye onDespite Shift in Preferences, Higher Interest Rates Likely to Aid Margins: Interest rate hikes from the beginning of 2022 have resulted in an improvement in investment managers' margins. Also, the rise in industry consolidation witnessed since 2020 is likely to continue supporting bottom-line growth. However, given the continued need for low-cost investment strategies, the demand for passive investing has been on the rise, which has hurt investment managers' margin growth.Story continuesNevertheless, while the Federal Reserve paused rate hikes in June, it increased rates again in July, and is expected to keep interest rates high in the near term. Thus, rising rates are expected to support margin growth to an extent, while higher funding costs may slightly weigh on it.AUM Growth Likely to Continue Despite a Volatile Trend in Asset Flows: In 2020 and the first half of 2021, there was a significant rise in equity market volatility and solid client activity, owing to the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, which aided total AUM growth. In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Year 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players.While the overall market volatility has decreased so far in 2023, various asset managers are still experiencing asset inflows, as investors seek higher yields. Thus, despite the current challenging market conditions, AUM growth is expected to continue in the near term. Asset managers' top lines are, therefore, expected to be positively impacted by higher performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Are Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers' bottom lines.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 41-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #112, which places it at the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a bright earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are slowly gaining confidence in this group's bottom-line growth potential following the release of better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results. The industry's current-year earnings estimates have been revised marginally upward since the end of June 2023.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's check out the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 10.6%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 3.2%, while the Zacks Finance Sector has depreciated 2.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.75X. This compares with the highest level of 5.43X, the lowest level of 2.12X and the median of 3.69X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.92X, which the chart below shows.As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group's P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.51X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry's ratio, which the chart below shows.3 Investment Management Stocks to BuyT.

For these companies, total earnings are down -9.8% from the same period last year on +0.3% higher revenues, with 80.6% beating EPS estimates and 66.3% beating revenue estimates.For a detailed analysis of Q2 earnings, I invite you to view our weekly Earnings Trends report –&gt; Earnings Estimates Reflect StabilizationAnd next week, there are many notable companies slated to report as well, including United Parcel Service UPS, Disney DIS, and Sony SONY. But how do estimates fare for each heading into their respective prints? Let’s take a closer look.United Parcel ServiceAnalysts have been slightly bearish for the company’s quarter to be reported, with the $2.51 per share estimate down 1.2% over the last several months. The value reflects a 23% pullback in earnings from last year's comparable period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOur consensus revenue estimate presently stands at $22.9 billion, forecasting an 8% drop in sales year-over-year. Analysts have primarily kept their top-line expectations muted, with the estimate down a fractional 0.2% since May.The transportation titan has posted somewhat-mixed quarterly results as of late, exceeding earnings expectations in three consecutive quarters but falling short of revenue estimates in each instance. The market reacted negatively to the most recent print but shares have since rebounded modestly.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisneyDisney has witnessed bearish activity among analysts for its upcoming release, with the $0.99 per share estimate down nearly 10% over the last 60 days. The value reflects an almost 10% drop in earnings year-over-year.Story continuesAs shown below, analysts have taken their expectations lower for the quarter to be reported and for all other periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, revenue forecasts have been taken modestly lower since mid-May, with the $22.4 billion estimate down 1.3% and reflecting an improvement of roughly 5% from the year-ago period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe entertainment giant posted a modest EPS beat in its latest release, but the market reacted negatively, with DIS shares plunging post-earnings.

(NYSE:UPS) Worth US$182 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-nyse-ups-130120176.html,1691154080,STORY,['UPS'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, United Parcel Service fair value estimate is US$149United Parcel Service's US$182 share price signals that it might be 22% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 22% lower than United Parcel Service's analyst price target of US$191In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.63bUS$8.64bUS$9.41bUS$9.08bUS$8.93bUS$8.89bUS$8.91bUS$8.98bUS$9.09bUS$9.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -1.66%Est @ -0.53%Est @ 0.26%Est @ 0.82%Est @ 1.21%Est @ 1.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$8.0kUS$7.4kUS$7.4kUS$6.6kUS$6.0kUS$5.5kUS$5.1kUS$4.7kUS$4.4kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$59bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$152bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$152b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$68bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$128b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$182, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.044. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Parcel ServiceStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

Please go ahead.Andrew LudwigGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on second quarter 2023 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we'll conclude with a Q&amp;A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 in a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures including earnings from ongoing operations on this call. For reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.Story continuesVincent SorgiThank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.15 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. Overall, second quarter results were in line with our expectations apart from the continued mild weather and storm activity in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as this has been one of the most active storm years we've ever experienced. Between the mild weather and storm O&amp;M, our year-to-date results were negatively impacted by about $0.09 per share compared to our original plan. But despite these impacts, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share with a midpoint of $1.58 per share. We have identified several areas in which we can offset the headwinds from weather and storms, and Joe will cover that in detail in his financial review. As you know, one area we remain extremely focused on is O&amp;M, and we are on track to achieve the $50 million to $60 million targeted reductions this year. And despite the incremental storm expenses, we are tracking slightly ahead of our O&amp;M forecast through June. We expect that trend to continue and improve through the second half of the year. In addition, today, we reaffirmed our projected earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2026, as we remain confident in our low-risk business plan. This will be supported by our $12 billion capital investment plan and targeted O&amp;M savings of at least $175 million by 2026 to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and clean energy future. Turning to a few second quarter operational highlights. We continue to deliver excellent reliability for our customers across our jurisdiction, again, despite the increased storm activity in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. This is a direct result of our ongoing investments, not only in system hardening that prevents outages, but also smart grid technology and automation that enables us to respond more quickly when outages do occur. On the integration of Rhode Island Energy, we remain well positioned to complete our transition services with National Grid next year. We also continue to make progress on an important filing before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, as we seek to deploy advanced metering functionality across our service territory and build a smarter grid that supports the state's leading climate goals. Hearings before the Rhode Island PUC were held in late July to review our business case and cost recovery proposals. We expect a decision on our AMF filing later this fall. We also remain on track with the Kentucky CPCN process, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. Finally, we continue to receive awards for our industry-leading approach in grid innovation as both the Edison Electric Institute and the Southeastern Electric Exchange recognized PPL Electric Utilities for its groundbreaking use of dynamic line rating technology. PPL Electric is the first utility in the nation to integrate this technology with its transmission management system. DLR sensors provide real-time information that enables us to better utilize our existing transmission line capacity and reduce congestion on the grid. (inaudible) has also recognized the value that this technology can bring to the industry and better managing congestion on the transmission network. Turning to Slide 5 and an update on the CPCN process in Kentucky. We remain focused on advancing our generation investment plan as we seek to replace 1,500 megawatts of aging coal generation with an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy mix by 2028. We remain confident our plan represents the best path forward for our Kentucky customers. As proposed, it would replace several 1970s era coal units with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, it would establish more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs. In May, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our request to consolidate the CPCN filing and our generation retirement request as required by Senate Bill 4. The commission approved the consolidation while keeping the CPCN procedural schedule largely unchanged. For the schedule, intervenor testimony was filed July 14 with no real surprises. Next up is our rebuttal testimony due August 9, followed by an info conference scheduled for August 15 to explore a potential settlement. Public hearings are then set to begin August 22 and could last several days. Again, we are very confident that the plan we've proposed is in our customers and the state's best interest but we are also open to settlement discussions with the parties to the case. Ultimately, with or without a settlement, we anticipate a decision on our filings from the commission by November 6. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update.Joseph P. BergsteinThank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 7. As Vince mentioned, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared to $0.30 per share in Q2 2022. The Primary drivers of $0.01 per share decline from last year were lower sales volumes in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania driven by mild weather and as expected in our plan higher interest expense due to increased borrowings at higher interest rates to fund our growth. Those factors were partially offset by lower O&amp;M expense, driven by our continued focus on operating efficiency and improved earnings at the Rhode Island segment from 2 additional months of results in Q2 2023 compared to the prior year. Overall, our teams performed well for the quarter and results were slightly ahead of expectations, apart from the mild weather, which impacted results by $0.03 per share compared to our forecast. Degree days were lower by more than 20% in our Kentucky service territory and by over 35% in Pennsylvania. This resulted in lower actual electricity sales volumes of 4% in Kentucky and 8% in Pennsylvania compared to normal. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense partially offset by higher transmission revenue and higher distribution rider recovery. Our Kentucky segment results decreased by $0.03 per share year-over-year. Results were impacted primarily by the lower sales volumes and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower O&amp;M expense. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year, reflecting the additional 2 months of earnings this quarter. Finally, results at Corporate and Other increased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&amp;M expense and other factors that were not individually significant partially offset by higher interest expense. Moving to Slide 9. Our Q2 performance puts PPL's GAAP earnings at $0.54 per share year-to-date through June 30. Adjusting for special items recorded through the second quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $0.77 per share for the first half of 2023. Mild weather has unfavorably impacted our year-to-date results by a total of about $0.08 per share compared to our planned due to lower sales volumes. In addition, we have experienced higher storm-related costs of about $0.01 per share compared to our planned so far this year due to the significant storm activity. Importantly, we've been able to more than offset these increased storm costs and we are tracking favorably to plan on O&amp;M through the second quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our 2023 earnings forecast as we expect to offset the unfavorable weather and storm impacts due to the projected outperformance in several areas. First, the disc mechanism in Pennsylvania is projected to offset the lower sales volumes and higher O&amp;M experience in that segment. Second, we are tracking favorably on our integration of Rhode Island Energy, which we expect to provide upside compared to our plan. Third, the convertible debt financing that we executed in the first quarter will reduce our annual interest expense relative to our plan. And finally, we continue to optimize our discretionary O&amp;M. This includes contractor and consultant spend, and the timing of filling open positions and other discretionary O&amp;M spend. In total, these identified offsets present a clear path to achieving the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.50 per share. We have an excellent track record of achieving our financial targets, which we expect to continue in 2023. Looking ahead and our plans to achieve at least $175 million of O&amp;M efficiencies by 2026, we established a Transformation Management Office or TMO, to ensure we achieve our long-term efficiency objectives. The TMO, which I chair, with support from our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Information Officer, and with the engagement from our employees across the entire company is responsible for tracking our progress on savings initiatives as well as identifying and verifying additional areas of possible savings. To date, we have identified over 100 initiatives with savings potential significantly above our $175 million target. This structure and rigorous process gives us even more confidence that we will achieve the targeted savings assumed in our long-term forecast and it will help us deliver a more affordable clean energy transition for our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince.Vincent SorgiThank you, Joe. In closing, we remain confident in achieving our goals for 2023. While mild weather and storms have created some headwinds, we have plans in place to overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to share owners. We're also on target to complete more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure improvements to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. Our integration of Rhode Island Energy continues to go smoothly. We continue to progress our regulatory filings in both Kentucky and Rhode Island. And last but not least, we're solidly on track to deliver our targeted O&amp;M savings as we execute our Utility of the Future playbook, incorporate more technology and automation and centralized various functions across PPL to deliver better value for customers and share owners alike. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraPretty straightforward quarter here. I had 2 housekeeping questions. First, can you quantify what's the AMI ask in Rhode Island? How much investment that is?Vincent SorgiWe're in the $200 million range Durgesh.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And over (inaudible).Vincent Sorgi$250 million somewhere around there. Sorry, say that again?Durgesh ChopraSorry. Over what time frame is that $200 million to $250 million?Vincent SorgiWell, we need to get that approved, right? So we just went through the hearings late last month. We expect to have a decision by the commission up there in the fall of this year. And then that will kind of dictate the time frame over which we deploy that capital.Durgesh ChopraWould that be incremental to your current CapEx plan Vince? Or do you have some...Vincent SorgiNo, that's in the current plan.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Okay. And then just in terms of the offsetting the year-date headwinds and weather and storm, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you mentioned like integration savings. Can you elaborate on that? How brings that pie obviously, it sounds like a lot of opportunities in excess of $175 million. But maybe just like what's the upside on the integration and Rhode Island and what might be the other opportunities?Joseph P. BergsteinYes. So the integration in Rhode Island Durgesh is going very well. Really, what we're -- have been able to do is exit TSAs quicker than we had expected and at a lower cost which is driving a lot of the outperformance we're seeing there. We're also mindful of the pace at which we're hiring some of the open positions we have there. So we're fully staffing up that operations and looking to take over completely from grid. And so those are the areas that are driving the Rhode Island integration. We would expect that to be about $0.01 to $0.02 for the year. As far as the progress on the $175 million and the establishment of the TMO, that's going extremely well. As I noted, we have over 100 initiatives totaling more than $175 million. Really, it's driven by significant employee engagement as we're developing tends to implement and achieve the $175 million, the TMO also provides a forum for employees to share their ideas, areas that we could save on O&amp;M and be more efficient across the company. So I don't want to give a dollar amount on that yet at this point as to where we are. We -- part of the process of that brings a lot of rigor to the savings, we got to bet them all to complete business cases where needed. What I can tell you is that we are confident in achieving the $175 million and potentially more than that and the development of the TMO really is even enhanced that confidence as we're working through this.OperatorThe next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.Paul Andrew ZimbardoJust to follow up on that last question of Durgesh quickly. Is the TMO and those savings more about derisking and extending the outlook? Or is that something that could be incremental in the planning period?Joseph P. BergsteinYes. So we'll have to go through all of those items. I mean, certainly derisk and give us confidence in the $175 million through the planning period, whether those items that are in excess of the $175 million we'll have to see whether they come into this period for execution, whether they are longer-dated items. And look, there's headwinds that we have to offset as well. We still see inflation and interest rates. So we have a bank of ideas and opportunities to execute on should we see those headwinds persist or increase, and then it just gives us confidence in the near term to achieve the $175 million and the 6% to 8% earnings growth, and it gives us confidence in the longer term to continue to execute on the strategy.Vincent SorgiYes. I would reiterate that, Paul. I think it gives us both, right? Certainly, shores up the confidence in the $175 million, but likely gives us upside potential looking beyond that.Paul Andrew ZimbardoOkay. Great. Very clear. And then switching topics. I noticed the weather-normalized sales volumes were decently down in the quarter and now trailing 12 months, both Pennsylvania, Kentucky. Just could you give any color on what you're seeing on the ground and just expectations for the second half of the year?Joseph P. BergsteinYes, sure. So well, from a second half of the year, we would expect we have in our forecast normal weather. From our longer-term forecast, we continue 50 basis points of sale of the growth in our plans in total and we continue to be -- believe that, that's an achievable growth forecast. Some of the near-term impact that we're seeing, particularly on the residential side has been due to energy conservation with the rising commodity prices. I would expect that to be a shorter-term anomaly given that we've seen a significant decline in commodity prices already this year and we would expect longer term to see growth in residential usage as electric vehicles and electrification becomes more prevalent. Lower industrial sales in Kentucky have not really impacted our margins. Those customers more are demand-driven than usage. As we think about longer term, there's a number of factors that give us confidence in our assumptions. We continue to see positive economic factors in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, including continued flow unemployment rates and strong GDP growth. As we've discussed in numerous times in Kentucky, we're coming off of back-to-back record years of economic development of over $10 billion of ounce investments in each of '21 and '22. That includes the Ford EV battery plant initiative, which we've talked a lot about. That's broken ground and well under construction. The state is targeting another $8 billion of investment for 2023. So when we look at the 10 years prior to this period from 2010 to 2020, there was an average of about $4 billion per year in economic development. So to see $10 billion in each of '21 and '22 and projecting $8 billion this year highlights the Kentucky is a great place to do business and continued economic development there in support of our growth assumptions. But we continue to see strong industrial growth in manufacturing and agricultural sectors as well.Vincent SorgiYes. We're not concerned with volumes at all other than the impact on weather. I would say our volume story is really weather-driven.OperatorThe next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroLet's see. I think just one here. I was curious, we're starting to see some easing of supply chain pressures in the solar industry, commodity costs coming down, module prices declining somewhat in PPA prices easing. I was just wondering if you think that could impact at all the outlook for your Kentucky, just the generation mix maybe longer term, or other opportunities to see lower PPA prices or lower costs in the current CPCN filing or if you're thinking and analysis has evolved at all for the longer-term generation mix there?Vincent SorgiYes. Look, I think the bigger issue in getting our solar deployed in Kentucky is siting and permitting days as opposed to necessarily the supply chain issues, although you're right, they have been an issue across the industry, and that is starting to abate. In our case, though, I think it is more siting and permitting, which I think the company-owned solutions make that much easier because we can navigate that easier than third-party developers have been able to so far. So as you know, our CPCN has a combination of company-owned and PPAs in it. We'll continue to look at the executability of those PPAs and that if we continue to see issues there that could actually push us more to recommending more company-owned where we have a higher degree of confidence that we can get them built.OperatorNext question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaSo Vince, I just want to -- starting with the Kentucky CPCN filing. I mean, obviously, thanks for the incremental color and the prepared on the time line. As we look ahead to the prospects for settlement. You mentioned August 15 formal conference. I guess what could that look like? Is it partial, maybe the gas but not the renewables? Just any additional color on how to think about that would be great.Vincent SorgiWell, look, I think you can appreciate, I don't necessarily want to get into negotiating positions at this point on the call. But what I'll say just around the process itself is we're actively engaged right now with various interveners. As you mentioned, the settlement conference is scheduled for the 15 if that goes well, and we can get settlement on at least significant issues in the case with enough parties. Then we may be able to present a stipulation to the PSC for their consideration. As you know, the hearings are scheduled to begin on the 22 of August, that could become a forum for the PSC to take up the settlement agreement, if we're able to reach one. But at this point, I'd say, Shar, it's too early to tell if we'll be able to reach a settlement. But if we don't, of course, we're ready to defend the plan as filed, as we've been indicating all along. So a little early at this point to tell if we can get there. But certainly, we're open to those discussions.Shahriar PourrezaSo let me just drill down a little bit on the defending side. Any off chance there are issues with the CPCN, right? Do you -- I guess, Vince, do you have avenues, either through pollution control or T&amp;D work to offset that space in your CapEx plan, I guess, in a scenario where there's issues. And then do me a favor, could you just maybe frame what -- how much of that CapEx you could see being backfilled, right, in that worst-case scenario?Vincent SorgiWell, look, I think the key takeaway is I'm not sure I would expect whether we have a settlement or fully litigating our case that, that would have a material impact on either our capital plan or our EPS targets given the different buckets of CapEx, whether it's building replacement generation or environmental spend or other types of CapEx that we might deploy in Kentucky and elsewhere across the fleet. If you look at the testimony and based on everything that's been filed to date, I don't think the outcome Shar is going to be an all or nothing on the coal plant retirements. But when you look at the -- Good Neighbor Plan, which was consistent with what we were assuming in the CPCN, that would require SCRs on Genco-II, Mill Creek 1, Mill Creek 2, also a new cooling tower at Mill Creek 1. When you look at the MATS regs and the ELG regulations, especially the ELG regs, that could result in significant incremental investments if we were required to do so. So even if it was a full rejection of the retirements, which again, I don't think that will be the outcome. As we've talked in the past, that's in the $500 million to $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx. That doesn't even include the amount of maintenance capital we have to spend on those plants going forward. So again, I'm not sure the outcome necessarily impacts the CapEx and EPS trajectory. It might just be different buckets where we're spending that capital.Shahriar PourrezaAnd then just lastly, that bucket you're going to be spending that capital. This is obviously the worst-case scenario, so no one's are assuming this. But in the case that it does turn out to be negative, that incremental capital doesn't have a timing lag, right? So you can go ahead and recognize it fairly immediately where we wouldn't keep divots in your earnings growth in the near term?Vincent SorgiSome of that CapEx would have to -- we would have to start spending that right away to continue to operate those plants. And that, to your point, that would be recoverable under the environmental cost recovery which does not require a base rate case for recovery.OperatorThe next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillThis may be repetitive. I know you said that the testimony from intervenors was kind of in line with expectations. Did you learn anything about their positions that was incremental to the process that -- or the process itself that you're willing to share?Vincent SorgiNot really, Gregg. I would say the testimony was as expected. I think we talked about expected intervener positions when we rolled out the plan that we filed. So we knew the coal association would be against retiring coal. We know the environmental intervenors would be pushing more renewables. Again, our plan we think balances all of those interests. But more importantly, it complies with SB4, it complies with our obligations to serve lease cost, reliable, safe energy. It is increasingly cleaner which we're hearing a lot from our customers and from our 2 major cities in Louisville and Lexington. So we were extremely thoughtful and took a lot of actually intervener input from the IRP process into coming up with what we proposed. As I talked about, however, we are willing to engage in settlement discussions with the parties, and we'll see if we can reach something here in the next couple of weeks going into the hearings beginning on the 22. So I would say, as expected and we incorporated most, if not all of that into the original plan that we filed with the commission.Operator(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellI just wanted to follow up on Shar's question just one, and I'm not sure you can answer it. Do you know if the commission in Kentucky would prefer the parties reach a settlement or given maybe with the closure of plants or whatever, that they're more buyers or they prefer a fully litigated track to have maybe a stronger record?Vincent SorgiI don't know that they have a preference one way or the other. Anthony, to be honest with you, they're going to uphold their obligation to ensure whether it's a settlement or our case that it meets the requirements of SB4 and again, our obligation to serve in a lease cost reliable way. So they're going to do their duty regardless of what's in front of them, whether it's a settlement or our case. Not sure if they have a preference on which one is in front. I mean they'll take a settlement as evidence in the case. They don't have to approve the settlement, but they will certainly take it as evidence in the case the authority really lies with them in terms of whether or not to accept that or not.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGreat. And then just lastly, I believe the company has been successful in reaching settlements in the past in Kentucky. Has -- I'm just -- my memory is getting a little foggy. I believe the commission has approved those settlements and not modify them. Is that accurate?Vincent SorgiSo you're right. Generally, we have been able to reach settlement with the parties to our cases. The commission has modified them slightly in the past, nothing to material. At times, they've accepted them as filed. And other times, they've modified them, I would say, slightly.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.Vincent SorgiI just want to say thanks for joining us on the call. Feeling good about our progress so far year-to-date, looking forward to the second half of the year. And have a great weekend, everyone, and we'll see you soon at the next conference.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you so much, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Lucile Blaise, President of our Sleep &amp; Respiratory Care Business for the Q&amp;A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures.Please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported numbers. Our discussion today will also include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the Risk Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results of our June quarter, the last quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Our results reflect incredible growth across our entire business with double-digit growth in our devices, masks, and software businesses. Unconstrained availability of our market leading cloud connected flow generator platforms has enabled us to continue to offer access to 100% cloud connectable AirSense 10 flow generated devices in all of our major global markets and beyond. In parallel, we are ramping up and improving the availability of our best-in-class AirSense 11 platform, which will gain further geographic regulatory approvals throughout the fiscal year and steadily increasing supply also throughout the fiscal year 2024 and beyond.Story continuesAlthough challenges within the post-COVID supply chain haven't completely been mitigated yet, we expect ongoing steady improvement in component and end product supply in the quarters ahead using a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. While we remain focused on scaling production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform, we remain on allocation for the Air 11 platform for the next few quarters. But I want to be clear on this point. With combined availability of the unconstrained Air 10 platform, we have enough devices to meet all of the customer needs that we see in major markets and globally. With the powerful combination of the Air 10 and the Air 11 platforms, we have the two best device platforms on the market.Our strong double-digit 23% year-over-year growth in the devices category demonstrates that customers are choosing ResMed and we are delivering. Our masks and accessories business also performed at a very strong 18% growth in constant currency this quarter. Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these strong growth results amid a challenging industry environment where component costs and freight costs are still working their way through our inventory post this supply chain crisis.I'm proud of the work that 10,000 ResMedians have put in every week, every month, every quarter to deliver these incredible results for the business, for our customers, for our shareholders, and ultimately for our most important customer, our patients. Let's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business; number two, to design, develop, and deliver market leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate, and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. In terms of our patient facing digital health platforms, adoption continues to go very well.The feedback we hear from patients and healthcare professionals remains very positive. We are seeing strong adoption of the myAir patient app by folks using AirSense 11. In fact, it is more than double the adoption rate that we saw with our AirSense 10 platform with many, many millions of patients signing up and engaging daily on their myAir app to view their own sleep data on their own phone and to review their own therapy data. This is important as engagement with a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to higher adherence to therapy in patients. And higher adherence to therapy is directly related to better patient outcomes, to increased resupply and to better economics for the payer and the healthcare provider with lower overall healthcare costs.Last month, we announced and closed the acquisition of Somnoware. Somnoware is a U.S.-based leader in sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software and physician management software. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline the end-to-end pathway for patients and make it easier for sleep labs and physicians and their practices to diagnose and manage patients, we're excited about this acquisition that complements our current ecosystem of software solutions, including AirView for providers and physicians and Brightree for home care providers. These ecosystem together will drive greater efficiency and better patient care by accelerating the pathway to therapy and with a better overall customer experience. We're also excited about our progress across several digital health technology initiatives to further increase the value proposition for our connected healthcare ecosystem.Over the next several quarters, we plan to introduce several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider facing AirView platform, as well as the patient facing myAir app. Early testing of these AI driven data products is very positive in both of these customer groups, and we will refine to the optimal digital design and then we will launch and then we will scale these products around the world. These AI driven data products provide personalized suggestions to increase therapy adherence and to ultimately improve patient outcomes as well as patient, physician, and provider experience. We will continue to invest in the world's largest digital healthcare ecosystem that we have with over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud as we continue to unlock value from those data to benefit physicians, providers, payers, and patients.We saw strong growth in our respiratory care business in the quarter through ongoing adoption of our non-invasive ventilators as well as our life support ventilator solutions. We're still in the early stages of market development with some of our newer to market technologies in this category, including home-based high-flow therapy that we call HFT for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD in the home. We continue to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We're encouraged by the clinical results we've seen with our HFT trials so far, and we continue to remain very focused on addressing COPD as one of the top diseases globally for hospitalization and the number one cause of re-hospitalization in the U.S. geography.The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focused on having low cost, high quality solutions to address this health epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 34%. Our SaaS business growth was supported by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business, as well as solid organic growth of 8% across our Brightree and MatrixCare portfolio of SaaS businesses. We're pleased to see sustained high-single-digit growth in our SaaS business on an organic basis, driven by the ongoing strength in the HME and infusion segment, and more stability in the facility segment as patient flows have now rebounded post-COVID.I'm very impressed by the leadership of our most recent SaaS portfolio addition MEDIFOX DAN, which is on track and meeting or beating our expectations. I'll be visiting personally with the team in Hildesheim, Germany, this quarter to discuss the growth face-to-face with the digital health innovators there in Hildesheim who are changing healthcare and taking care of people in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest quality of life setting, which is very often the home. We believe this is the future of healthcare and that's where we're investing and that's where we're winning. Our customers continue to see the value of adopting technologies to improve and optimize business efficiencies and personalized care, and we deliver the best software solutions to help customers do just that.There is pent-up demand for technology investments in residential medicine verticals, particularly as staffing shortages continue to impact the industry, particularly in nursing, but across the clinician and provider groups. This presents opportunities for ResMed's SaaS solutions to streamline operations and create workflow efficiencies so our customers, staff can focus on providing personal care. It's up to us to deliver for our customers and drive growth. I have confidence that our SaaS business can accelerate from these high-single-digits on an organic basis to double-digit growth on an organic basis in the mid to long-term. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses.As an important example, our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate strong synergies between SaaS and our core business, providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. The output of this work can be seen in our very healthy 19% growth in mass revenues in the U.S. geography this quarter. Ultimately, this work results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer with lower overall healthcare costs. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. We have created differentiated value for our customers as well as long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Here at ResMed, we are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our businesses.medicine, healthsmart.art/Shutterstock.comAs we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations in this post-COVID world, we continue to leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive accelerated growth in our bottom line. We are focused on driving top-line revenue and maintaining tight discipline and increasing efficiencies so that we can lower costs and ultimately so that we can accelerate our impact and our bottom line profitability, delivering even further value for all of our shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I see improvements in our business margins with geography mix, with product mix, and specifically with strong bi-level and non-invasive ventilator growth with strong mass growth and with increased software solutions growth. All these business lines are margin accretive to our growth.I also see that the higher inventory costs and freight costs that we've seen through the supply chain crisis continue to work their way through our sold products and as we progress through the fiscal year, we will continue to drive the transition to AirSense 11 and we will gain regulatory approvals and we will scale production. All these factors above lead to tailwinds for the gross margin and the net margin of our business as we move through the fiscal year. I can tell you we are working furiously to drive all of the above elements with our global teams. We now have over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, as I said earlier, and those data come from over 21.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide.We continue to lead the industry in digital health and we don't plan to stop anytime soon because there's so much opportunity ahead of us. 7% of our revenues go straight into R&amp;D to power our hardware and our data innovation engines. ResMed's mission and key goal remains crystal clear. We will improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last 90 days and during the trailing 12 months, we have improved over 160 million lives with the delivery of a complete device platform to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that is helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live a high quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live.As we start fiscal year 2024 here, I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We just had our SaaS ASM earlier this week, and I'll be attending the Country Market Group CMG Group for our North America team in the coming weeks. And sales meetings are happening around the world. We're on a good trajectory. We have an exciting pipeline. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication both today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move and open up for Q&amp;A for the group. Brett, over to you.Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q4. Group revenue for the June quarter was $1.12 billion, an increase of 23% on a headline basis and in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of cloud connected AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $3 million in the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 25%.In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 24% while masks and other sales increased by 18%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from strong demand. And as previously mentioned, our continued ability to fully supply the market with combined availability of AS 10 and AS 11 cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 19%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of cloud connected devices.Masks and other sales increased by 14% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 34% in the June quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 8% in the June quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $27.3 million for the June quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 points to 55.8% in the June quarter.The decrease primarily reflects component cost increases; warranty and manufacturing related cost increases and product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales partially offset by increases in average selling prices On a sequential basis, unfavorable foreign currency movements accounted for the 30 basis points decline in our gross margin and we saw a lower than expected product mix benefit as we continue to see strong growth in sleep devices in the U.S. market. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&amp;A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 25%, or in constant currency terms increased by 26%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs marketing and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&amp;A expenses associated with MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022.SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 21.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year 2024. R&amp;D expenses for the quarter increased by 21% or in constant currency terms increased by 23%. R&amp;D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&amp;D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% during fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 13% underpinned by strong revenue growth partially offset by lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter is $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount per quarter in the first half of fiscal year 2024.Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 17.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 7% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 7%. During the quarter, we incurred $1.8 million in acquisition expenses associated with our Somnoware acquisition, and we recognized restructuring costs of $9.2 million associated with the closure of the Aria lymphedema business and workforce rationalization in our German and SaaS business verticals. We also recognized a gain of $20.2 million within our income in relation to a business interruption insurance claim. These have all been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q4 financial results.Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $47 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt, which mainly reflects the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $145 million. At June 30, we had approximately $745 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, representing an increase of 9% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance.Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&amp;D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as our recently announced acquisition of Somnoware, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&amp;A portion of our call.See also 20 Countries With Highest Rates Of AIDS and 30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

QuoteA Closer View of the Q4 Top LineTotal Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues improved 21% (up 21% at CER) from the prior-year period to $983.5 million.Going by our model, the Total Sleep and Respiratory Care segment globally was projected to rise 9.3% year over year on a reported basis in the fiscal fourth quarter.Total Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues in Europe, Asia and other markets rose 14% on a reported basis (same at CER) to $322.6 million.In U.S., Canada, and Latin America, total Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues were $660.9 million, up 25% year over year.Global Revenues comprised Total Devices revenues of $602.4 million, up 24% (same at CER) and Total Masks and other revenues of $381 billion, up 17% (up 18% at CER), all on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesGlobal Device revenues, per our model, were expected to grow 11.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter. Global Masks and other revenues, according to our model, were expected to grow 6.3% in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues grew 34% to $138.6 million year over year.MarginsThe adjusted gross profit in the quarter under review rose 18.3% to $625.8 million, despite a 28.6% uptick in the adjusted cost of sales (excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles).However, the adjusted gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 55.8%, reflecting a contraction of 205 basis points (bps). This decrease can be mainly attributed to component cost increases, warranty and manufacturing-related cost increases and product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales, partially offset by increases in average selling prices.SG&amp;A expenses rose 24.7% year over year to $240.7 million. Research and development expenses increased 21.5% to $78.1 million.The adjusted operating income was $306.9 million in the quarter under discussion, up 13% from the year-ago quarter. However, the adjusted operating margin contracted 233 bps year over year to 27.4%.Financial UpdatesResMed exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $227.9 million, compared with $273.7 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Total debt (short and long-term) at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter was $1.44 billion compared with $775.2 million at the end of the fiscal 2022.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter was $237.4 million compared with $79.5 million in the year-ago period.The company paid out $64.7 million in dividends in the fiscal fourth quarter.Our TakeResMed exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings  but higher-than-expected revenues. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter backed by the ongoing combined availability of cloud-connected AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand, as well as solid growth across ResMed’s broader product portfolio.Meanwhile, escalating costs and expenses that put pressure on the company’s gross and operating margins are worrisome. A year-over-year increase in the fiscal fourth quarter’s SG&amp;A expenses was due to an increase in employee-related costs marketing and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&amp;A expenses associated with MEDIFOX DAN that was acquired in November 2022.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, Elevance Health, Inc.

Now, those companies say they are going to stick with those higher prices despite seeing some pushback from consumers. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma what companies such as Coca-Cola (KO), Chipotle (CMG), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and others said in their earnings calls about maintaining higher prices.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Inflation showing signs of easing, which is welcome news to consumers. But from what we've seen so far in earnings season, many consumer giants are planning to keep prices high. Joining us now with a recap is Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. I know one of those companies that we talked about heading into you, heading into the break was Coca-Cola. But you've got a litany of them. And this is not welcome news for consumers For the companies, maybe.BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. But let's hear a little bit more. Because we're seeing ultimately what's happening here is these heavy hitter consumer companies like Coca-Cola ultimately raising prices. And consumers finally are putting their foot down. And we're seeing that in volume growth, or lack thereof rather. So at Coca-Cola, let's take a closer look at pricing. We saw a pricing increase 10%, but volume remaining flat. Now, in the call, they did say in developed markets like North America and Europe, they're seeing some willingness among consumers to switch to private labels, which is obviously not good news for them.And so in these particular markets, they said that our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. Now, moving right along, I mean, we're seeing this similar trend at Procter &amp; Gamble. They're pricing up 7%, volume dropping 1%. And P&amp;G CEO telling Yahoo Finance, ever posting its quarterly results, that this was a quote, ""very, very modest decline,"" which they would expect with the level of pricing that they've been taking. But they did hint at more on the call. He did say that pricing isn't going away in the absolute. It's linked to innovation. So they have a very strong innovation pipeline underway, which will ultimately cost more for our consumers.Story continuesConagra Brands, that's behind Birds Eye and Duncan-- Duncan Hine rather. They took a pretty significant price jump up 17% year-over-year. Now, the words that they used rather was inflation. Justified, they did see volumes drop as a result of that. And as you can see there, I mean, they noted that pricing peaked in Q3 due to their actions to offset that cost of goods. And they're estimating-- and they look-- as they look out to the end of the year, they're saying a slowing rebounding of volumes as prices start to ramp. But they do expect ultimately to keep up with those higher prices.And Kraft Heinz has decided to hold off to some higher prices. They did see net sales rise 2.6%. But volume is down there as well. And ultimately, the company did say that they are continuing trying to catch up with very high inflation costs, that they are a leader within the category. And so they had to make the decision. And they will do it all over again to raise prices.AKIKO FUJITA: Brooke, what are we seeing on the fast food, fast casual restaurants? I'm thinking back to a name like Chipotle, which was one of the first to step up and raise their prices.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Well, Akiko, we saw them actually miss on same store sales in their recent earnings report. And they were one of the first to raise prices. And earlier this year, in the springtime, they did say that they were going to hold off. But in the latest earnings report, that was in question among investors, especially on the call. They held up, and they sort of defended. CEO Brian Niccol saying that, I think we've proven time and time again that the brand is very strong, and the value proposition is very strong. And as they get closer to that fourth quarter, we'll make a decision on exactly what we want to do on that pricing front.So investors are certainly questioning whether or not that was a right choice to keep pricing in place earlier this year. But we're seeing this across the board at McDonald's here in the US. They benefited from strategic menu prices and positive guest counts, they called out. And earlier this week, when we talked to Starbucks CFO, they said that in the Q4, they will lapse those price increases that they took last year. And they'll see a more normalized return of price increases of 1% to 2%.But certainly, what we're seeing here is a bit of consumer pushback. We're seeing sort of that make way into same store sales as well as we do laps these price increases that fast food and consumer giants have taken.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. I'm going to make my coffee at home. Just kidding. Someday. Today, I am-- today, I had Starbucks though. Friday treat.]"

A lower pay ratio could indicate the companies that are dedicated to creating high-wage jobs and investing in their employees for the company’s long-term health.”While the average compensation of S&amp;P 500 CEOs declined by almost 9% between 2021 and 2022, CEO pay has jumped by an average of $5 million over the past decade, the report’s authors said.Last year, the S&amp;P 500 suffered its worst year since 2008, with stocks listed on the exchange shedding almost 20% of their value over the course of 2022.AFL-CIO compiled its findings using company proxy statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, collecting data from around 3,000 firms, including most of those listed on the Russell 3000 Index—which measures the performance of the country’s 3,000 biggest companies.Story continuesCEO-worker pay gapThe report also analyzed the CEO-to-worker pay ratio of publicly listed companies across other U.S. stock exchanges, comparing chief executives’ compensation packages to their median worker’s salary.One of the biggest gaps was at Ticketmaster parent Live Nation, according to the research, with the company’s CEO taking home 5,414 times more than its median-earning worker, who earned $25,673.Coca-Cola had a reported CEO-to-worker ratio of 1,883 to one last year, according to the report, while the chief executive of McDonald’s was said to have earned 1,224 times the median pay on offer at the fast-food giant.Tech giant Apple—where the median salary was $84,493, according to the AFL-CIO—had a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 1,177 to one, the report said.Apple CEO Tim Cook’s total compensation hit $99.4 million in 2022—but he will be taking a 40% pay cut this year, leaving him with a target income of $49 million.Representatives for Live Nation, Apple, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment on the AFL-CIO report.Highest paid CEOsThe report also ranked the highest-earning CEOs at America’s biggest public companies.At the top of the list was Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who took home more than $253 million last year, according to AFL-CIO data.The CEOs of Google parent company Alphabet, Hertz, and Peloton were the next most generously compensated, the report showed.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Earnings per share refers to the company's profitability after deducting all expenses from its revenue.Higher revenue does not guarantee significant profitability if expenses are also high. Conversely, even if revenue declines, a company can improve its overall profitability by reducing expenses. Mortgage REITs report earnings per share, but all other REITs report FFO. EPS is the ratio of net income to the number of outstanding shares of stock.  FFO takes EPS and deducts the impact of taxes, losses and preferred dividends.This week, several REITs reported FFO that either met or surpassed analyst estimates or were up year-over-year from the second quarter of 2022, but missed analysts' estimate numbers on revenue. Lagging revenue could be an indicator of potential recessionary trends to come. But the strong FFO could indicate that these companies are already proactively tightening their belts in anticipation of possible economic challenges ahead.Trending: This REIT You’ve Never Heard Of Is Crushing The Market – Up 36% Over The Past Two YearsTake a look at 10 REITs that recently reported FFO that either beat or met the consensus estimate or improved year over year, but missed estimates on revenue (note that M or B indicates millions or billions):REIT NameFFO/EPS per shareEstimatesQ2 2022Revenue (M or B)EstimatesQ2 2022Agree Realty Corp.$0.98$0.98$0.56$129.9M$130.64M$104.88MApollo Commercial Real Estate$0.46$0.41$0.35$62.96M$71.11M$57.39MClaros Mortgage Trust$0.35$0.30$0.43$80.92M$80.99M$69.24MCommunity Healthcare Trust$0.62$0.57$0.62$27.81M$27.96M$24.05MEquity Commonwealth$0.22$0.22$0.04$14.59M$15.24M$15.54MFour Corners Property Trust$0.42$0.40$0.41$60.89M$61.21M$55.42MIndependence Realty Trust Inc.$0.28$0.27$0.26$163.60M$164.95M$154.64MLTC Properties Inc.$0.66$0.65$0.64$31.54M$47.25M$31.63MNNN REIT Inc.$0.80$0.80$0.79$202.43M$203.4M$190.78MThe Weyerhaeuser Co.$0.32$0.21$1.06$2B$2B$ 2.97BThe 10 REITs shown in the table above are from a cross section of six REIT subsectors, signifying that it's not just one or two subsectors that are beginning to show this trend.

Reported EPS is $2.54, expectations were $2.38. Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Todd and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company’s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today’s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker’s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.medicine, healthsmart.art/Shutterstock.com Kevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker’s second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker’s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today’s call, I’ll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&amp;A. In the second quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 11.9% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. This comprehensive performance demonstrates the diverse and attractive markets that we play in and our ability to drive growth through strong commercial execution. We are also pleased with the continued positive outcomes of our globalization efforts. Our international business demonstrated strong performance with double-digit growth, complementing our strong and fast-growing U.S. business. In addition, we continue to see traction with our pricing initiatives, again delivering positive pricing in the second quarter. During the quarter, we continued to realize improvements in component availability, although disruptions remain in parts of our business. Our teams have demonstrated good agility in addressing these situations, proactively mitigating much of their impact. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.54 a share, reflecting 13% growth compared to the second quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also marks the beginning of our margin recovery. We expect margins to continue to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Finally, with half the year behind us and our solid momentum, we have increased our expected full year organic sales growth to a range of 9.5% to 10.5% and increased our expected earnings per share to $10.25 to $10.45 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako, acquisitions and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes have largely recovered to pre-COVID levels in most countries. And while volumes are strong, patient backlog still remains, and we believe the elevated orthopedic procedural demand will continue well into 2024. While volumes have largely recovered, hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe. These challenges are resolving gradually as we expected and will continue to be a moderate tailwind as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as evidenced from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Instruments and Neuro Cranial divisions. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international performances, which is helping drive our continued growth in hips and knees. Next, capital order backlog remains elevated, well above normal levels. Also, during the quarter, we executed a small tuck-in deal and also closed on the Cerus Endovascular acquisition. Furthermore, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In late Q2, we successfully completed a limited launch of our 1788 camera platform and are poised for full launch in Q3. We also received FDA clearance for Cranial Guidance, our newest application under our Q Guidance platform. This empowers surgeons to quickly plan a safe surgical approach using multiple imaging modalities and then navigate instruments with specific surgical procedures. Finally, we remain on track for the launch of our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year and in the U.S. in early 2024. These launches will continue to support growth over multiple years. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today’s press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.9% in the quarter. The second quarter’s average selling days were in line with 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.5%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.7% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12%, International organic sales growth was 11.4%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Adjusted EPS of $2.54 in the quarter was up 12.9% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.03. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology has both constant currency and organic sales growth of 12.9%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 10.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by strong double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and surge account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 3.5% against a strong comparable. This included strong growth in its ProCare sustainability and sports medicine businesses. The Endoscopy business completed its limited launch of the 1788 camera late in the second quarter. Consistent with prior camera launches and the related transition period between the legacy camera and the new camera, this also contributed to muted growth in Q2. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 27.2%, reflecting very strong performances in all three of its businesses, acute care, emergency care and Sage, and benefited from continued improvement in product supply during the quarter. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 9%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.6%, which included double-digit growth in our Bone Mill, bipolar forceps and Max Space product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 10.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in our medical and Neuro Cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and Canada. Neurovascular’s growth continues to be negatively impacted by VBP in China. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.6%, which included organic growth of 10% in the U.S. and 12.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 10.6% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business grew 8.8% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia hip stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 14.3% organically with strong performances across all businesses led by very strong growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.2%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our U.S. Other Ortho declined organically 1.6%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 12.1% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorable, approximately 60 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and 70 basis points sequentially compared to Q1 2023. This change was primarily driven by the slight easing of certain cost pressures, decreases in spot buy purchases, improved productivity and the benefit of price, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange. Adjusted R&amp;D spending was 6.4% of sales, which represents an 80 basis points decrease from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&amp;A was 33.1% of sales, which was 70 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022, due to a disciplined ramp of spend and investment to support our growth. We expect our full year SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.3% of sales which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $66 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense. The second quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we reiterate our full year effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.9 billion. Approximately $100 million of the term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, reflecting year-to-date payments of $200 million and a remaining balance of $650 million. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.1 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. Considering our year-to-date results, our strong backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% with pricing to be slightly positive for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&amp;A. See also 15 Most Consumed Meats in the World and 30 Drunkest Cities in America in 2023.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus: Congrats on a great quarter here. Two for me. First, a great quarter. It looks like you’re raising more than the beat on both the top and bottom line. Looks like you’re taking a good amount of share still in Ortho across hips, knees and extremities, trauma. Just as we think about the balance of the year, you touched on some of them, but would love to get a sense of what gives you the confidence these elevated trends are going to continue. And any visibility on the margin side that gets you comfortable moving it up more than the beat? Kevin Lobo: Hi Robbie, it’s Kevin. I’ll start off with sort of the confidence in the procedures. We’ve talked about this since the third quarter of last year, a good sense based on surgery backlogs, talking to physicians and seeing that there was pent-up demand through the pandemic. So, we expected elevated procedures coming into the year. That has certainly played out. You’ve heard even similar comments from some of the providers in the space. And these surgery backlogs are long -- they longer, probably a two-month surgery backlog is more like four months. And so that gives us confidence that through the end of this year and into next year that we’re going to continue to see elevated procedural growth. And we also see that in the demand for our small capital, which again, there’s equipment that’s used for ongoing procedures. And then, I’ll turn to Glenn for margins. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. Hey Robbie. As we got through the quarter, as I mentioned, we really started to see some positive and easing of some of the cost pressures that we had felt in Q1 and certainly last year. I think we also are starting to feel some of the improvements in supply chain. That’s not to say that everything is rosy. We are still feeling inflationary pressures in transportation, some of our commodities, labor, certain electronics. But I will say that spot buys in Q1, spot buys in Q2 have not been material. And we’re getting near the amortization of the impact of spot buys from last year. So I feel like that gives me good confidence that I think we’ll see continued improvement in our gross margin as we move into Q3 and Q4. And so, we really will feel that gradual improvement, and we’ll feel it all the way down to the op margin line. Robbie Marcus: Great. And maybe just a follow-up for me for both of you or however you want to take it. People are really happy so far with the year, but unfortunately, we’re always focused on the future and looking out to next year already. You talked about, Kevin, these trends continuing. You have the super cycle in MedSurg. Just any kind of thoughts on how we should think about these elevated trends continuing and thoughts? I know you’re laser-focused on getting back to your 2016 -- or 2019 operating margin of 26.3%. How do we think about how far out that might be? Kevin Lobo: Well, I think Jason’s comments in the openings say we do expect the procedural positive trends to continue well into next year. I don’t have a crystal ball exactly, will that be 100 basis points or 200 basis points more elevated than it was back through the pandemic in last year. So -- but we expect that to be elevated. The super cycle of products is widely exciting, something like -- look at Neptune S is off to a great start within instruments, the 1788 [ph] is only going to start kind of the latter part of this quarter. So, that’s going to b a big impact next year, got a new defibrillator coming that’s more next. So, these are launches, ProCuity is multiple year. We have the stair chair of the Xpedition. Amazing product that medical launch brand new and it’s new category altogether that launched Q1 of this year, that will continue into next year. So, a lot of continuation of really strong growth across our businesses. So, you should expect what -- going to continue to be a high-growth company going into next year. Yes. Let me just -- sorry, let me finish. I forgot it was a long question. So yes, we are absolutely committed to returning to pre-COVID margins and then growing our margins thereafter. This quarter marked a really important step, a very big first step in that evolution.Operator: We’ll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen: Thanks for taking the question. And I’ll echo Robbie’s congratulations on a very impressive quarter here. So Kevin, I wanted to start on MedSurg, the new products. Just talk about how the new camera in endoscopy might have impacted Q2? And what you expect the impact to be from that in ‘23 and ‘24? And Medical growing 27% organically after Vocera anniversaried. What drove that? And how did Vocera do in the second quarter? And what’s the outlook? And I had one follow-up. Kevin Lobo: Okay. You got a few in there already, and you got a follow-up. But okay, that’s fine. Listen, we’re really excited about the performance of our MedSurg business, continues to be really a great segment of our company. What I’d tell you on the endo side is the camera had really no impact. It was a limited launch, really just making sure that the product is performing as we thought. And the test cases have gone extremely well. And really, the full launch hasn’t started. That will start in the back half of the Q3. So you’ll start to see some impact in Q3, and that will accelerate in Q4 and that will even accelerate more next year. As you know, you’ve seen these launches in the past. So it really picks up year one, sometimes even year two, be even higher than year one. So, we’re going to see a lot of impact next year. There’ll be some impact in Q3, but -- in Q4, but really, it will start to ramp. So it’s really no impact in Q3 on endoscopy. And that’s why endoscopy is a little bit softer, had a big comp from last year, too, but at the end of these camera launches, you do see it start to slow down and then it really picks up with the new product. Medical had an absolutely stellar quarter, another 25-plus percent growth, and we had that in the fourth quarter, if you recall, as well. And Medical has really over the past six years, become a large, consistent high-growth division. It does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, if you look at a rolling 4 quarters, rolling 8 quarters, this is a real high-growth business. Now I think it’s probably one of the most misunderstood businesses, honestly, or I would say, underestimated business in our portfolio. You’ve got the integration of Sage, Physio-Control, Vocera, which you referenced. But you’ve got new launches, Power-PRO 2 as a new ambulance cot at the beginning of last year. ProCuity bed frame still gaining steam. Sage has PrimoFit. You have Xpedition’s stair chair that I mentioned. And then there’s also a lot more awareness on safety. So our AED portfolio, there’s a lot more awareness. So I would say new demand for AEDs based on all the safety, the LUCAS automatic chest compression product and really a fantastic management team in Medical. So, will I expect 25% again next quarter? Probably not. But I do expect that Medical will continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. And then specifically related to Vocera, it -- both sales and orders ramped in the quarter as we expected. So you remember, we sort of talked to you about Q3 -- Q3, Q4 and Q1 of this year kind of being flat after we sort of went through the integration and we said it’s going to pick up meaningfully, both picked up meaningfully in Q2, both sales as well as orders. And so they are also a contributor, but really strength across the entire portfolio. Larry Biegelsen: Thank you. And just I’ll keep my follow-up really brief. Glenn, the comps are very different in Q3 and Q4. Should we be thinking about stronger growth in Q3 relative to Q4? Just the cadence for the rest of the year? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. I mean, a couple of things. Q3 seasonally is usually not a super strong quarter, but I think if you focus on Q4 and you look at the comp that we’re up against, that probably plays into how much we’re going to grow against that comp. The big number last year, it was $5.2 billion in the quarter, which is a big number. So, I think what you’ll see is you’ll see slightly higher growth in Q3, and then that that will come down a little bit because of the comp, but I think we’ll end the year nicely, well within our guidance. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering: Very nice quarter. A follow-up on the Medical. Can you talk about the CapEx environment? How much has changed in the last sort of 90 days or so and possible increase in CapEx as the revenues and costs are looking pretty good for hospitals? And on the backlog, did you guys reduce the backlog in the quarter? And was that a bolus for 2Q and should that be normalizing in the back half of the year? And then also on Microchips, is that should we view that getting better as a gross margin improvement from lower costs or increasing revenues as you reduce that backlog?Jason Beach: It’s Jason. I’ll start here and then maybe some follow on. But as we think about the capital environment, we continue to see great strength from a capital environment standpoint. And even as you think about the backlog in our business, I think your question was, was there a bolus. But if you look at our backlog, it continues to be at very high levels, higher than what we came into the year with. So, still strength there on the capital side. Pito Chickering: Okay. And then one more on gross margin. It sounds like a lot of tailwinds in 2Q were pretty much permanent in nature, and you said that the gross margin should improve in the back half of the year. Can you refresh us on how many months of inventory you guys have on the balance sheet? And when those -- these deflation pressures we’re seeing, start transferring to the P&amp;L. Just wondering if that’s sort of the key driver of the gross margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter simply by duration by waiting for that to transfer. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think the big thing that really sits in inventory and worked its way through sort of in the first quarter and the second quarter was the impact of those spot buys. And generally, inventory turns depending on the product, anywhere from 6 to 9 months. So yes, we will generally see the impact of spot buys reduced for the rest of this year. Keep in mind that we still have this sort of inflationary headwind that we will be working against in Q3 and Q4. But just the mere fact that I feel like we’re getting to the end of the impact of spot buys, gives me confidence that we should see gradual gross margin improvement in the rest of this year. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar: Kevin, the guidance is pretty impressive, 10% organic. Are comps something that we should worry about from a fiscal ‘24 perspective? I know you mentioned certain product tailwinds. Just help us contextualize that 10%. And given that some of these procedure trends, it looks like it could sustain into ‘24. Kevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Remember, we grew 9.7% organically last year. So, we had a pretty good year last year as well and we’re growing on top of that. Again, this innovation cycle we have is tremendous. The procedure demands are strong. We’re -- as you see, we’re growing very fast even though the markets elevated, we’re growing above market in virtually every one of our businesses. So that gives us confidence that we’re going to continue to be able to grow at the high end of Medtech. And for this year, we’ve -- already half the year is already in the bag. And yes, the Q4 last year was abnormally fast, growing over 13%. So we -- in our guidance, we do reflect a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rate just related to those comps. But we do expect, based on backlog of surgery demand, aging population, more people playing pick a ball, you name it, right, activity, causing injuries. So this will continue to be a tailwind. And we think through much of next year -- that’s our current visibility. I mean obviously, that could change, but that’s how we see it. And we kind of called this, if you recall, Q3 of last year, we sort of called that this is what we were going to see. It’s actually materializing, frankly, a little better than we expected in terms of the flow-through in procedures and hospital staffing. They’re dealing with it much better than we expected. There are still flare-ups here and there, but it’s certainly gotten better, hospitals are better equipped and patients are anxious to get their procedures done. Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful, Kevin. Glenn, maybe one for you. It looks like we’re on track, actually well north of 50 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal ‘23. Is this something that’s sustainable when you look at the operating model, assuming there’s nothing crazy on the inflation side for next year. I’m curious how we should be thinking about leverage. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. We -- you’re going to force me to divulge all the things we want to tell you in our investor meeting. But I would say, our old mantra of expanding 30 to 50 basis points every year was absolutely doable, and it’s absolutely something that we are planning on getting back to. We’re working through some of these higher costs through the P&amp;L. There’s this ongoing inflation that we will solve for. But I don’t think that as we look forward over the longer term, the margin expansion is something that I think you’ll continue to see out of us. I don’t want to pinpoint a number just yet. But yes, it’s something we’ll continue to have. Kevin Lobo: Yes. The one thing I would add, so Glenn wasn’t necessarily referring to ‘24, when you said 30 to 50. We’re on a ramp and on a major focus to get back to that 26.3%. And then thereafter kind of get into a normal rhythm. So, we’ll give you more clarity around that at the Analyst Day in November. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Matthew O’Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O’Brien: I really don’t want to make too much out of one quarter here. But when I look at the two-year stacked growth rate for you guys versus your biggest competitor in hips in knees, you had been outperforming them massively in the last several quarters. This quarter, it really tightened up the delta between you two, specifically in knees. So I’m just wondering if there’s anything you’re seeing competitively, maybe in cementless or on the robotics side, that you should call out or that we should think about as you go forward, just in terms of being able to significantly outperform the market in hips and knees over the next year or so?Kevin Lobo: Yes. Look, I’m actually pretty happy with double-digit growth in our Knee business. And look at OUS, we’re really starting to ramp the OUS. Mako is just getting going. It’s really getting started. So that massive outperformance you saw before was on the backs of Mako and cementless. And we’re probably going to see some of that outside the United States. And the U.S. performance is very strong. In one quarter, I’m not going to get overly excited. We’re still the fastest growing Hip and Knee company. And you remember from the past, you used to be -- grew well in one, you didn’t grow well in the other, and we covered both, hips and knees. It wasn’t hips or knees, hips and knees in Q2. So, no, we’re not seeing anything as really different. We focus on our own execution with our market-leading robotics and our strong portfolio continue the rollout in Insignia, which has been an absolute home run. We’re going to continue to perform very well. Matthew O’Brien: I appreciate that, Kevin. And then on the pricing side, I know it’s now flipped from kind of a headwind this year to a tailwind. But I’m assuming we’re working through some of those benefits. So, is pricing going to be another tailwind or positive for Stryker into ‘24 and even ‘25 as well as you’ve got these long-term contracts? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. I think I’ll make some couple of comments around that without maybe providing exact guidance on 2024. But, if we look at the initiatives that we executed this year, we had a very targeted program that looked kind of product by product. And in general, what we’re seeing is MSNT is generally gaining positive price. And I would say Ortho is less negative and has much larger, longer-term contract negotiations. Keep in mind too that our price comparison that we report on includes sort of same product sales compared to prior year. So, if you think about increases that we gain on prices, say, on next-gen products that we’re going to launch, that’s not necessarily included in the number we say for price. But I would tell you that we generally see meaningful price increases on these next-gen products, especially when we bring newer technology to the market or a feature set that currently isn’t provided. So, I do think that we’ll continue to see price as a tailwind. It’s a muscle that we’ve certainly grown this year, and I think it’s going to be part of our game plan for sure. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman: Congrats on a really nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask, Kevin, a little bit about the Cerus deal and Neurovascular. It was slower before, but 9% organic growth in the U.S. is really nice to see, especially in hemorrhagic. When we look at what Cerus has done in the UK, it’s been pretty impressive. And so, I’m curious kind of what your expectations are for the contribution in the U.S. and when we start to really see that in numbers, especially if you’re doing 9% U.S. organic growth in Neurovascular. Kevin Lobo: Yes. So the first thing I’d say is that Cerus has not yet approved in the United States. So, that 9% growth had no benefit from Cerus, right? So I think you know that. I just want to make that clear to everybody that the trials are ongoing right now. We look forward to that approval in the United States. We’ve launched two new products. We had a Tetra small coil as well as 46 catheter -- 46 size catheter, Vecta catheter. So two new products that helps in terms of driving the hemorrhagic growth. And the U.S. has been a little bit of a challenge for us more if you look back at the last few quarters, and really pleased to see that step up in this quarter, and we’re very excited that -- and we closed the deal. Obviously, it was during the quarter. It hasn’t had been a big impact at all. But a lot of excitement at the product we know performs extremely well based on what’s happening in OUS, and we can’t wait for the approval. It’s definitely going to be a shot in the arm when it does happen in the United States. Ryan Zimmerman: Yes. No question. We saw that at SNIS this week. I wanted to ask a follow-up on robotics. We didn’t hear you say much on your Shoulder and Spine programs. And just given that there is some other commentary out there from competitors about kind of Shoulders and Spine. What’s your latest thinking about potential timing, launch cycles and so forth on Mako shoulder and/or spine. Kevin Lobo: Yes. Great. Nothing new to report. We’re kind of on schedule with what we had said before. Spine in the back half of next year and shoulder towards the end of next year. And frankly, we’re not really concerned about competitive activity in this space. We already know Globus and Medtronic have robots in spine. We are really excited about our overall enabling technology starting with Q Guidance. We have an additional product that we’ll be launching and Mako Spine. So, by the end of next year we’ll have a really compelling suite of enabling technology tools for Spine, which we’re really excited about. If someone else is first in shoulder it doesn’t concern me in the least. We have Blueprint already. We already have a very powerful enabling tech platform for shoulder, whether it’s patient matched ID, whether it’s using HoloLens to do the procedure with virtual reality, whether it’s the Blueprint technology, which is amazing.And we’re going to use that amazing Blueprint technology to feed Mako, and that will just be icing on the cake on an upper extremity business that is cooking on gas right now with amazing growth quarter after quarter after quarter. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Shagun Singh with RBC. Shagun Singh: I was just wondering if you could refresh us on your capital allocation priorities and M&amp;A just in terms of deal size valuation in areas of interest? And then on the product side, if you could just touch on trauma and what’s driving the strong growth there and the durability? Thank you. Kevin Lobo: Yes, sure. So as we’ve said in the past, we -- our first focus on capital allocation right now is paying down debt, given the debt that we built up on Wright Medical as well as Vocera. That does not stop us from doing little deals. We did one small deal within instruments, and then we close on Cerus. So we’re still looking at tuck-ins primarily this year. But the deal teams are all very active. They’re having discussions. They’re out building their lists and they’re all really having nice pipelines. And so as our cash position gets strong, again, we’ll be back on offense. That will be the first use of our cash. I mean, we’ve had a really terrific track record of M&amp;A, and we can’t wait to be able to get back on offense with M&amp;A. But first priority is certainly paying down debt at the moment, and we’re doing that. So, what’s the second part? Jason Beach: Trauma. Kevin Lobo: Yes. So trauma, I’ll tell you this Wright Medical acquisition has been spectacular. The upper extremities business growing very strong double-digit growth every quarter. Foot and Ankle really starting to pick up. So we’re really excited about the performance this quarter was terrific in Foot and Ankle with strong double-digit growth. And then core trauma has actually been a big beneficiary of Wright Medical. So in the past, our core trauma business was really diluted in its focus. It was focusing on Foot and Ankle, focusing more on extremities because they’re faster growing. And we were sort of not paying as much attention to core trauma. We have a great leadership team on core trauma with now dedicated focused R&amp;D resources. And obviously, they launched Gamma4. We had the T2 Alpha product launch. We’re going to have PeriPRO products launch soon, excited about some other innovations we plan to show at OTA later in the fall. So, really refreshing the portfolio, great focus on core trauma and they had a really excellent quarter as well. So, all three business units performed very well in the quarter. And again, the Wright Medical deal, it’s not just benefiting our extremities business, it’s actually providing more focus core trauma, which is fueling terrific growth in core trauma. So trauma, we expect to continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Eric Anderson: This is Eric on for Josh. I was curious to hear your thoughts around smart implants. One of your competitors is moving closer to a full launch of a smart implant technology, and I was just curious to hear your updated thoughts there. And if there are any updates to share from your work around OrthoSensor, that would be great to hear as well. Kevin Lobo: Yes. Listen, I think smart implants is interesting. We obviously have MotionSense which is a wearable on the outside to measure basically similar dynamics that are going to be measured from the smart implant. So I think range of motion, all these factors, it’s interesting. We’re not quite sure yet what to do with that data. How compelling that will be, will that affect patient selection? Will it affect approaches to procedure? So I would call it something that is more investigational and more of a learning that we’re going to have. And -- but I do think it’s something that could be important in the future. So not discounting it. I don’t have anything more to share on OrthoSensor other than we are -- we have launched MotionSense, which is the wearable which attaches to both the femur as well as tibia to track mobility and a range of other metrics. And we’re going to learn a lot, we will and so others in the industry about what is it that really matters that you’re measuring in the post-surgery period, and really how does that affect the patient care, patient -- maybe patient selection, maybe what implants they should be using, is there a feedback loop that’s meaningful. We don’t know -- we don’t have answers. We have a lot of questions, and it’s going to give us new data that we can then learn from. So that’s how I’d characterize at the moment. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matt Miksic: I wanted to ask a question on Mako, one of the comments that you made, and I apologize if this came up already, hoping back and forth really, because a lot of folks tonight and different calls. But you mentioned an increase in deal mix, I guess, an increase in rental deal mix affecting the dollar revenues that came in from Mako in other -- this quarter. And that’s something we’ve heard from other folks as well as you’re I’m sure aware in terms of robots, more sort of hospitals taking a flexible option to leasing or as-you-go arrangements for robots. First, I’m wondering how tightly correlated that with sort of growth in the ASC? And the second, in the past, Kevin, I think you talked about like early on, well, some hospitals are capital rich, some hospitals are operating in commercial and have endowments or whatever, there’s different hospitals have a different preference on how they want to pay for -- that was sort of like how we used to think about this. I’m curious whether you’re seeing sort of hybridization of that? In other words, we want to know Mako, you could pay for it, but let’s scale into it, with a lease arrangement or something. I’m wondering if you’re seeing that kind of shift in the market. And I have one follow-up, if I could. Kevin Lobo: Yes, sure. Thanks. So what I would tell you is the ASC’s growth is obviously increasing in the ASCs with Mako and virtually all of the ASC deals are financed because physician ownership is part of the ASC scenario. They don’t have the capital budgets the hospitals do. So yes, as ASC penetration increases, more financing, rental type deals are automatically going to happen because they’re virtually all financed, the ASC. Your question around the hospital dynamic, I think it’s just if you have competitive systems that are not sort of being charged for, then the hospital says, well, maybe I don’t need to spend the capital, even if I have the capital and maybe I -- let me talk to you about what you do. And so, we offer them the full suite. And yes, some are opting to go for the financing route that maybe in the past would have purchased, but we have a healthy order book, and we’re not really agnostic to whether they want to buy cash or where they want to finance it. It really doesn’t matter to us because we get the value from that. Whether we get the value on cash on day one and get the cash over time doesn’t really concern us, and it certainly has been fuel for our strong implant growth. Matt Miksic: That’s great. And just quickly on -- you mentioned endoscopy later in the camera and not really having an effect yet, but quite differentiated and quite different this cycle with the sort of opportunity to test surgical margins around tumors and things that really represent kind of a new phase of sort of camera and imaging functionality. Any sense -- I know it’s early but -- of what that does to the shape of this product cycle versus what we’ve experienced in the past? I mean fluorescence imaging was pretty big for you in the last launch, this sort of takes that up a notch, just any color you can provide in terms of what your expectations are and the early interest, et cetera, on the camera side. Kevin Lobo: Yes. Thanks. Look, it’s a little early still for me to get too ahead of myself, but the fluorescence imaging was a big deal, right, first in 1588 and then 1688 when you had the overlay from fluorescence where you didn’t have to toggle between black and white and fluorescence. That was pretty meaningful. So those are pretty big steps. But you’re right, this -- with the tumor margin ability -- the ability to use new dies beyond ICG, wildly exciting to get into lung, to get into bladder. This is really, really exciting with pharmacological agents. It’s also a camera that is extremely good in neuro and sports where historically, we weren’t as strong. We had -- it was fabulous for general surgery, but not quite as good.This camera addresses those issues. So, I’m really excited about it. But it’s a little early that the test cases have gone very well. I wouldn’t expect this to be any less performing than our prior launches, potentially could be even more. The feedback so far is pretty exciting. Yes, we have some really good features in this front. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne Wuensch: I apologize, there’s a lot going on tonight. But your operating margins were really impressive. And I’m curious how we should think about those for the back half of the year? And if you can give a full year guide on it, or even how we should think about this into next year, if you’re willing to waive that far? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes, Joanne, we -- yes. We really -- if you think about operating margins, especially our performance in Q2, we saw a really sort of good improvement, honestly, in gross margin just in terms of some easing of some of the cost pressures, as I’ve mentioned before, spot buys are not material. They weren’t material in Q1, and they’re not material in Q2. I think the other thing, too, that we’re feeling is just that now that we have more evening of supply, we’re also back to sort of better productivity gains. And so all of those things give us good confidence that we should see gross margins improve in the back half of this year, and they’ll gradually improve because we’re still feeling some of this inflation, but that kind of gives us the confidence. And obviously, some of that will roll into next year as you think about our performance for next year. But we -- at this point, we’re not going to guide on that other than to say that we do think we’ll see some gradual improvement for the rest of this year. Joanne Wuensch: Maybe this is an analyst question at the meeting or the next time you gather all together for an update. But how do you think about in a more normalized post-pandemic environment sort of operating margin expansion on a regular go-forward, maybe even year-over-year basis? Kevin Lobo: Yes, Joanne, earlier in the call, I think this question was asked, I’ll just repeat that we are laser-focused on, I would say, trying to sprint back to the 26.3% that we had in 2019. And so we’re going to try to move margins on a more ambitious way to get back to that. And then once we get back to that kind of level, I think you’re going to see us wanting to expand margins in a kind of a more consistent way. I don’t know the exact number, something like 50 bps. We’ll get more specific as time passes. But more like an annual, more moderate, nice progression year after year after year, especially with this kind of high growth that we’re experiencing organically. You’re going to expect to see more normalized margin expansion. But in the meantime, we’re looking to move at a faster clip given the falloff that we’ve had since ‘19 and try to restore those margins. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise: Kevin, I was hoping you would just give us a little more color and perspective on really your very solid international performance double digits, obviously, almost the as strong as U.S. performance, but a little slower than the first quarter’s pace. You highlighted the strong emerging markets. How -- I’m just going to ask one question with a couple of parts. How sustainable is this? You talked about some of your key initiatives? And just maybe just your perspectives on the sustainability, what’s the drivers here? And maybe where we are in terms of procedure volume recovery back to normal in Europe just in a larger picture sense? Thanks so much. And great to see the excellent quarter. Kevin Lobo: Yes. Thank you. Look, international has -- it took us a while, but the last five years, international growth has exceeded the U.S. growth. Now obviously, the U.S. growth this quarter was pretty spectacular. But we’re absolutely a believer and continue to have very good international growth in the years ahead, frankly, making up for lost time because our market shares are still below what we have in the U.S. in most of the international markets. And so we have significant upside in front of us. Procedure volumes are pretty much back to normal everywhere. They’re back normally in Europe. They’re back to normal in Australia. They’re back to normal pretty much in Japan. So, the market that hurt us, frankly, in the quarter was China. So that China continues to be a drag because of VBP both in neurovascular having an impact, also impacting our Spine business. So China continues to be a bit of a drag. But in spite of that, we had really terrific growth in international. And I’d say that Mako is really starting to pick up steam in Asia Pacific. So we already have a pretty good presence in Europe. But in Asia Pacific, it’s Japan, India, China, it’s really starting to pick up. And I think that’s a great leading indicator that will produce really terrific growth both in hips and knees for many quarters to come as that momentum continues. And then as well, the camera launches of 78, that’s also really exciting for the international market. So, we’re going to continue the progress.Even Europe had another strong quarter. That’s just kind of expected now. It’s steady and strong growth every quarter, and we’re still not where we’d like to be in Europe. So, this is just one of those things that takes time. But if you think about something like cameras, where when we started the Transatlantic model, we were number 5 or 6, and we expect to take over number 1 sometime this year. Our power tools share was in the low 30s, and it’s crossed 50%, but it’s still not where it is in the United States. It’s not where it is in Australia. So, international should be something that continues in a very steady way. Just as it has the last five years, it’s been kind of very consistent. And in emerging markets, that’s the area we have the most opportunity, where we’re still very, very small, growing nicely, but off a small base. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I’ll ask both of mine up upfront. Some of the payers and providers have talked about a slower July. I was just curious if you could kind of frame some of the summer seasonality, if you’re seeing more normal seasonality or how it kind of compares given some of those payer comments? And then a margin question for you, Glenn. Just curious if we should use the second half operating margin this year as kind of a new jumping off point since this is the more normal cost environment in the second half? Kevin Lobo: Listen, sorry, your sound quality was a little hard hearing you. I think you’re asking about July if we saw something strange seasonality in July. And look -- we don’t normally comment on one month. And I would tell you -- you saw our raised guidance like we’re expecting a pretty good second half of the year. And I don’t really want to get into one month. And the -- sometimes you do have certain dynamics that happen. But there’s nothing really important that I want to call out for the month of July. And then I think the second part was margin. Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. Travis, can you repeat that in terms of the operating margin question? Travis Steed: Yes, sorry. I’m just curious if the second half of this year is kind of the new jumping off point for margins going forward, just given that this is a more normalized cost environment in the second half? Glenn Boehnlein: Yes. No, I would say a couple of things. First of all, Q4 is always seasonally higher. It’s our highest op margin performing quarter. So, I wouldn’t necessarily say that that should be the jumping off. I think if you back up from where our guidance is, you could sort of figure out kind of where we’re angling to end the year at, and that would be the good jumping off point. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Unidentified Analyst: This is Simon Hagan [ph] on for Danielle. Congrats on the strong quarter. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes to the underlying ortho market growth when you look at factors such as pricing, innovation and potential trend towards treating both much younger and older -- much older patients? And I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo: Yes. Look, the trends aren’t different than what we’ve seen in the past. It’s surgery demand backlogs of surgeons that people -- frankly, the older patients who’ve been -- now really want to get procedures done, there are more active people out there, as I kind of referenced earlier, who want to get their procedures done. So innovation wins the day, right? So the robotics continues to be a real terrific for us, and we continue to see increased utilization. Percent of Mako procedures done continues to rise. Percent of cementless continues to rise. Percent of hips being done on Mako continues to rise. So that’s not new. Those are a continuation of prior trends. And so there isn’t some kind of new dynamic. It’s just the pent-up demand of patients that we kept waiting for, they’re coming and they’re going to continue to come for some period of time. And the aging population, people every day, some 10,000 turn 65. And so there is demographics that are on our side. There is the hangover from COVID that’s on our side. And for Stryker, we have a portfolio that we’re really excited about. In addressing the Direct Anterior with our Insignia stem was critically important, and we’ve done that, and we’re seeing fantastic uptake of that hip stem, which is driving terrific growth in hips. So that’s kind of new for us as to -- if you look in the last year, our growth has really picked up, and that was really because of the product that we launched really addressing an important and growing segment of the procedures in hips. Unidentified Analyst: And just one follow-up, really off of what you were just talking about. Looking at the competitive position in large joints in the United States, how do you expect to continue driving share gains, and where do you see yourself given continued innovation?Kevin Lobo: Look, we really like our chances. A huge demand for Mako hasn’t stopped. We know we have the best system on the market, which we’re really excited about. We’ve filled our gap with Insignia on the hip side. We have an awesome 3D-printed hip cup with Trident II. We have the cementless offering, which, of course, we’re way ahead, a huge head start on cementless. Terrific publications coming out with excellent five-year data on cementless, which will give surgeons even more confidence in that in the future. And so there’s other things the team are looking at. We have some really exciting products -- our hinge product that we’re going to come out with later this year to shore up revision. And that’s pretty exciting. We have plans to have revision on Mako as well in the not-too-distant future. So we’re not going to sort of sit tight on just everything we’ve already done. There are incremental additions. We just not so long ago launched that 2.0 software for -- to improve the user experience, improve the training of residents. And so, we think we have a winning hand, and we’re going to continue to play that hand. Operator: We’ll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham &amp; Company. Mike Matson: I want to ask one about the Q Guidance System in spine. It sounds like it’s doing well. I’m just wondering if you could maybe give us sort of an overview of it. I know you’ve had navigation systems time before. Is this something kind of different, or is it more just the latest version? And then how does it kind of fit in when you do bring Mako into spine? Kevin Lobo: Yes. What I’d tell you is this has the fastest camera on the market. Homegrown, we didn’t use a third party to do this camera. It is lightning quick. And that camera will eventually be ported to the Mako as well. So that make will have that same terrific camera. It really -- the user experience is terrific in terms of being able to see and be able to do your procedure. So, the feedback we’ve gotten is outstanding. So, we’ve always been good at navigation, but this is sort of really putting our best foot forward. And this user experience that you’re going to have with Q will transfer to the Mako spine, and that we’re really excited about. So this is -- this even before Mako is already having an impact. And we think once Mako’s launched, it will really fill this important need in the market for us to have a robotic application. We also have another product in enabling technology coming out of our instruments vision that’s going to be used by the Spine group. A little early for me to give you details on what that is. But at the appropriate time, we’ll tell you about that. So that, combined with Mako is going to give us very compelling enabling technology platform for Spine. Mike Matson: Okay. Got it. And then just given the guidance, I assume this is early, kind of material issue, but I thought I’d ask about it anyway because we’ve heard about it from some other companies. But can you just comment on any Russia exposure you have and whether or not there’s the latest sanctions are having any sort of impact on your business? Kevin Lobo: Yes. Obviously, we’re abiding by all the sanctions, as you would expect, and working in lockstep with the industry on industry-wide response to what should be humanitarian products and should be -- should they go through the approval process. That’s obviously very lengthy. It did have a negative impact. But honestly, our Russia business is so small that it’s kind of meaningless in the overall picture of Stryker. But yes, we are abiding by the sanctions. Yes, it did have a negative impact, but it was really -- it’s not a material business for Stryker. Operator: Our last question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Richard Newitter: Congrats on the quarter. Kevin, I think a few months back in the first quarter, you were asked a question at an investor conference about what areas could be of interest to you? There’s so much going, right, across your existing businesses. So obviously, M&amp;A, though, is still top of mind. So I’m just curious kind of where are the holes? And where do you think the investment could be most incremental for you? Kevin Lobo: Look, it’s a good question. I think I’ve talked about the adjacencies that we’re interested in. First and foremost, there’s a lot of tuck-in demand. Each of our businesses are building their wish lists and sort of evaluating different targets. And I think that’s job one is looking at those near-term targets that tuck-in. Those create tremendous financial returns for Stryker. They don’t always move the needle for the overall growth, but they’re really terrific financials for us to do. And when you feed our existing sales force of Stryker, we know how to sell, and we’re able to really do that very, very well. I would tell you, in the adjacency space, no change to the adjacencies that we’re interested in. I think I’ve mentioned them before. What I would tell you is neuromodulation’s one I’ve talked about in the past. And within neuromodulation, obviously, there’s a lot of different parts to that. There’s spinal cord stimulation, there’s deep brain stimulation, there’s peripheral nerve stimulation, and stimulation as you know in sleep apnea. And I do believe electrical treatment is going to be a big part of the future. Over time, we’ve been a little hot cold on spinal cord stimulation. I would tell you right now, we’re probably a little bit more cold on it, just kind of a challenging market and -- so that’s the way the only thing maybe I haven’t said in the past. But otherwise, every other adjacency that I talked about in Q1 are still very much on our radar screen. And as our cash frees up, probably more into next year. If the tuck-ins aren’t of a significant size and we have cash starting to build up and our debt position better, hopefully, we’ll be able to make a move in one of those adjacencies that I’ve talked about in the past.Richard Newitter: Thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on Spine. It’s one of the few businesses that’s not back in the high single digits or better yet but you obviously have pretty good line of sight to seemingly transformative technologies and product rollouts with Mako, but that’s 1 year, 1.5 years away. So I guess, do we just kind of think of spine as a grind from here higher or stabilization and then look out when ‘25 comes around? Kevin Lobo: Yes. I think the word stabilization, I’d probably prefer that than grind, but yes, it’s probably both, right? So Spine is a tough market, no question about it. But already with Q Guidance, we’re feeling good about that. We’ve bolstered our expandable portfolio a bit. We still have a couple of gaps that we’re looking at. Obviously, we would like to fill. But the enabling tech is really what gets us excited. And so I think the robotic platform will put us on a par at least with the competitors and then this other secret launch I talked about from coming out of instruments, which we’ve shown some surgeons kind of will put us ahead of the game on enabling technology. But yes, we have to wait. Unfortunately, it’s not ready yet. It’s coming. The instrument launch will probably come in before the Mako, and that will be able to be used with the Q Guidance. It will be compatible with Q. So that’s where -- you’ll hear about that probably earlier than you’ll hear about Mako. But yes, I wouldn’t assume we’re going to -- we’re going to try to kind of keep in line with market growth, which is kind of what we’re doing right now, hold our own until we get to that period of time, and then we could start to grow more like a typical business of Stryker. Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo: Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in early November. Operator: This does conclude today’s Stryker’s second quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.]"

The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25.3%.GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.91, reflecting a plunge of 16.9% year over year.Revenues in DetailRevenues of $3.00 billion in the second quarter were up by 2.5% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%.The top line was driven by solid performances by DaVita’s dialysis patient service revenues.Segment DetailsThe company’s dialysis patient service revenues were $2.89 billion, up by 2.9% year over year. This figure compares to our dialysis patient service revenues’ second-quarter projection of $2.79 billion.Other revenues were $109.7 million, down 5.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. This figure compares to our second-quarter projection of $134.3 million.Per management, the total U.S. dialysis treatments for the second quarter were 7,231,242 or 92,708 per day, on average. This represents a per-day increase of 0.3% on a sequential basis.As of Jun 30, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 were U.S. centers while 353 were located across 11 other countries.During the second quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of 10 new dialysis centers and closed 16 dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired two dialysis centers, opened two and closed two dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.DaVita Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | DaVita Inc. QuoteMargin DetailsIn the quarter under review, DaVita’s gross profit rose 3.8% to $944.5 million. The gross margin expanded 39 basis points (bps) to 31.5%.We had projected 29.6% of gross margin for the second quarter.General &amp; administrative expenses climbed 15.5% to $364 million.Adjusted operating profit totaled $580.5 million, reflecting a 2.4% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter contracted 97 bps to 19.3%.Story continuesFinancial PositionDaVita exited the second quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $339.9 million compared with $367.1 million at the first-quarter end. Total debt (including the current portion) at the end of second-quarter 2023 was $8.69 billion compared with $8.66 billion at the first-quarter end.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of second-quarter 2023 was $912.7 million compared with $510.3 million a year ago.2023 GuidanceDaVita has raised its adjusted EPS outlook for 2023.Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the full year is now projected to be in the range of $7.00-$7.80, up from the prior outlook of $6.20-$7.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $6.71.Our TakeDaVita ended the second quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The uptick in the company’s overall top line and dialysis patient service revenues during the period was impressive. The increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter was also encouraging. The opening of several dialysis centers within the United States and overseas was promising. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock. DaVita raising its EPS outlook for the year also raises our optimism.However, the decline in Other revenues was disappointing. The contraction of adjusted operating margin also does not bode well for the company. The company faced continued cost inflationary pressure during the reported quarter, which was further concerning.Zacks Rank and Key PicksDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

He was last on in March 2023, when the banking crisis was ongoing. Back then, neither John nor Tracey saw an imminent recession. What about now?Yes, or No: Recession This Year?

During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.Peter Z. E. VanackerThank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with Slide 3. During today's call, we will discuss the resilient results that our team delivered during the challenging marketing conditions of the second quarter. And we will also provide an overview of our outlook for the second half of this year as well as our plans to optimize our advantaged positions to navigate volatile markets and feedstock costs. But first, let's take a few moments to review LyondellBasell's foundations and the progress we have made with our long-term strategy. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety results. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.15. While slightly higher than our results for 2022, our focus on safety continues to deliver performance that exceeds the top 75th percentile for our industry. Our leading safety results produce benefits that are reflected in our operations and ultimately, in our financial performance. Safety is a fundamental part of our core values and it will continue to be a critical enabler for our strategy and our future success. Let's turn to Slide 5 and review the progress on our long-term strategy. As we shared during our Capital Markets Day in March, our strategy is built around 3 pillars: grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and step up performance and culture. We are confident we have the right strategy, and we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress. Let me highlight some of our actions on these pillars over the past few months. Our value enhancement program is providing benefits for 2 of the pillars in our strategy. The VEP is generating volume growth as part of grow and upgrade the core and margin improvement captured within step up performance and culture. I am pleased to see the rapids progress and execution of these VEP initiatives. We are raising our 2023 VEP target for year-end annual recurring EBITDA run rate by $50 million to $200 million based on mid-cycle margins to reflect our accelerated progress. I will provide more details on this progress in a few minutes. In grow and upgrade the core, we are investing in our business that fits with our long-term strategy. Last quarter, we announced a successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This quarter, our team successfully completed technology performance tests to prove out the full capacity of the new facility. We're also managing our portfolio to ensure that all businesses are aligned with our long-term strategy. In May, we announced that we are extending our refining operations to no later than the first quarter of 2025. Let me be clear, we have not changed our decision to exit the refining business. The extension of operations will allow us to develop options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy. Now let's turn to the second pillar of our strategy. We're committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business to drive our leadership in circularity and address the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. We expect this business will generate at least $0.5 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030. Through multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements, we are building a comprehensive business model with powerful competitive advantages that come from new technologies, upstream sources of recycled and renewable feedstocks and downstream relationships with our customers and brand owners. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Last October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve our line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. We're leveraging the structure of our VEP to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. And Torkel and his team were making solid progress on transforming the performance of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Altogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to provide focus and alignment to drive our progress in capturing value and delivering a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at our approach to establishing leadership in circular solutions. As [Devon] stated at our Capital Markets Day in March, our circular and low-carbon solutions business is taking a differentiated approach by gaining advantage in 3 key areas: technologies, feedstocks and downstream customer relationships. We believe that our comprehensive strategy based on regional [health] will establish LyondellBasell as the leader in sustainable solutions. We're expanding our participation further up and down the plastic waste value chain to both gain scale and maximize the returns of various waste streams around the world. Today, our team is building supply chains to bring waste feedstocks into our existing facilities and driving innovation through investments in new technologies. As you saw on the previous slide, we are investing in both internal and external technologies such as LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling process as well as Pryme's pyrolysis process and LMF Nord's mechanical recycling. In line with our sustainability goals, we are advancing our carbon reduction initiatives through partnerships. In June, we signed an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric cracker demonstration unit in Channelview, Texas. We have completed power purchase agreements to support the development and procurement of renewable power for LyondellBasell's locations around the world. These partnerships utilize the unique strengths of each party to deliver superior results with a common goal, reducing the carbon intensity of our products to increase the value of our products for our customers. And we are leveraging the unique capabilities of our APS segment to upgrade our mechanical recycling portfolio while offering tailored solutions for our customers. Most importantly, we are building a business that provides these solutions at scale. Step by step, we are making progress toward our 2030 goal to sell 2 million tons of recycled or renewable-based polymers annually. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed approximately 220,000 tons of these polymers. LyondellBasell's differentiated approach uniquely positions us to unlock significant value as we address the needs of our customers and society. On Slide 7, we ask that you save the date for a webinar on September 26, with Jim Seward, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer; and Yvonne van der Laan, EVP of circular and low-carbon solutions. We will share more details on our MoReTec technology and our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We hope that you can join us virtually. Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss this year's updated target for our value enhancement program. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. Since the launch of our VEP, we have inspired a more agile and entrepreneurial mindset throughout our workforce. When we launched the value enhancement program last year, we announced targets to deliver recurring annual EBITDA improvements, run rates of $150 million by the end of 2023 and $750 million by the end of 2025. Our team is progressing ahead of plan for 2023. As we expanded the VEP to Europe and smaller U.S. sites during the first and second quarter, we found the enthusiasm and energy gaining momentum. We now think our recurring annual EBITDA improvement will reach a run rate of at least $200 million by the end of 2023. Let's get a bit more specific about a few of these VEP initiatives on Slide 9. At our low-density polyethylene manufacturing facilities in Clinton, Iowa, our team faced recurring reliability challenges related to valve controllers. With an investment of approximately $60,000, our team was able to upgrade the controllers and unlock more than $400,000 of annual value. The project was executed during a planned outage with VEP providing the resources required to rapidly resolve this chronic issue. The modest investment across our global engineering and procurement teams unlocked an opportunity to expand the supplier pool for electric motors at our manufacturing sites. We expect a direct annual cost benefit of $400,000 as well as an improvement in the security of our supply for these critical motors. These benefits will be realized with a total resource investment of only $70,000 over the next 3 years. At our Channelview facility, we invested the engineering resources required to implement a new process control scheme to improve yields and decrease energy consumption and distillation towers. Through better steam control and increased butadiene yields, we will realize $1.4 million in annual value at a onetime cost of $50,000. In addition to the direct financial benefits, this project supports our sustainability goals by reducing CO2 emissions by over 9 kilotons. One of our larger VEP initiatives will install a filtration system to remove solids from a byproduct stream at our olefins plant in Channelview. By upgrading the byproducts, we anticipate over $5.1 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement from higher margins and increased utilization through a modest $550,000 investment. These examples are representative of the hundreds of initiatives in our VEP portfolio. The average annual benefit of our initiative is less than $1 million. But the program is supported by rigorous economic analysis, diligent tracking and an evergreen process. The value enhancement program has been the catalyst within our organization to rapidly implement good ideas to create value. We look forward to providing you with regular updates on our progress as these initiatives become more prominent in our results. Let's turn to Slide 10 and focus on our financial results for the second quarter. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation despite challenging market conditions. Earnings were $2.44 per share. EBITDA was $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash on hand was $2.5 billion with $6.6 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.Michael C. McMurrayThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash conversion. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Our cash balance was $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our team efficiently converted 103% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 12 and review the details of our cash allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our robust cash generation comfortably covered our capital expenditures of approximately $300 million as well as our $508 million of returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.25 per share. 2023 will mark our 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. In May, we issued our first green bond to support investments that advance our strategy for leadership in sustainability. After the start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities in the first quarter, we successfully demonstrated full operating rates on these assets. Our capital expenditures are now focused on continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects. With the rapid progress in the value enhancement program and the extension of operations at our refinery, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will increase to $1.7 billion, $100 million higher than our original guidance of $1.6 billion. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets. 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivative assets and just below 95% for our refinery. In the appendix of the slide deck, we provide updated 2023 modeling guidance, CapEx and several other items, including refresh estimates on cost and capital expenditures associated with extending the operations at our refinery business. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 13. The LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter. Our results reflect modest improvements in O&amp;P margins and higher I&amp;D volumes, offset by weaker refining margins. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from lower feedstock costs. Demand for oxyfuels remained strong, while margins in our refining business declined due to lower refining crack spreads. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?Kenneth Todd LaneThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 14 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&amp;P Americas EBITDA increased $138 million to $679 million. North American integrated polyethylene margins increased on higher U.S. sales prices and lower ethane costs, while weak demand for durable goods continued to impact polypropylene margins. In the third quarter, we expect volatile feedstock costs and new capacity entering the market will compress margins. Also, demand is being impacted by cautious buying by our customers due to the uncertain economic outlook. As Peter mentioned, we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress on strategy. On June 1, we announced an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric furnace demonstration unit at our Channelview, Texas site. The technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for ethylene cracking and significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our olefins production. This collaboration is just one of many initiatives underway to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business for LyondellBasell. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, European ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs but this was offset by weak demand for polymers used in durable products. As a result, O&amp;P EAI second quarter EBITDA increased $7 million to $84 million. Looking ahead, we expect the European and Asian markets to remain challenging with consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Slow economic recovery, combined with additional supply in China will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we are growing our portfolio of recycled and renewable based polymers from consolidating our ownership in QCP mechanical recycling, investing in Pryme's plastic waste pyrolysis process, and building a flexible packaging recycling facility through LMF Nord, our CLCS team continues to build out our regional hub model to advance our leadership in circular and renewable solutions. Having said that, I want to emphasize the focus our team has on generating value and cash from operations. Our team is highly seasoned and is doing a great job at both. I want to be sure and acknowledge all of their hard work. Now I'll turn the call over to Kim.Kimberly A. FoleyThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased $46 million in the second quarter to $472 million. Additional capacity from our new propylene oxide facility was largely offset by planned maintenance downtime. Propylene oxide and derivative margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Demand for oxyfuels remains strong when margins were slightly lower. In line with the guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the third quarter on 2 of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&amp;D assets at approximately 75% of capacity in the third quarter, which includes the idling of 2 PO/SM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. In the second half of the year, we expect oxyfuel margins to compress as cost seasonally increase for butane are key raw material. Last quarter, we discussed the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant. This quarter, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the technology performance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The second quarter EBITDA declined by approximately $200 million to $114 million as the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads settled by more than $9 a barrel relative to the first quarter. Spreads for other heavy crude oil run at our refinery, such as the Canadian WCS declined further than Maya, providing additional headwinds to our margins. In the near term, we expect demand for refined products to remain stable and inventories to remain low. The recent elevation of crack spreads will likely moderate as outages in the refining industry are resolved. Nonetheless, we expect Maya 2-1-1 spreads to remain above historical averages. In the third quarter, we plan to operate the refinery at approximately 93% of capacity. This rate provides optimal economics for our asset based on our plans for crudes, products and operations ahead of our maintenance work. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability. In the fourth quarter, we are planning for FCC maintenance with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million. We are extending operations at our refinery to no later than the first quarter of 2025. This extension will help to bridge activities at the site as we develop new projects to transform site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.Torkel RhenmanThank you, Kim. Let's review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA moderately increased to $34 million. Margins for the polypropylene company business increased as product prices improved and energy costs decreased. We saw lower demand from the construction and electronics markets, while demand from the automotive markets gained momentum during the quarter. We expect demand in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter across most APS businesses. Typical third quarter downtime at OEMs will offset some of the automotive production gains we have seen in the first half of 2023 in Europe and North America. Our #1 priority in APS is to restore service levels to our customers and restore growth in the business. I'm happy to report that we have restored our service levels, and we're making good progress in refilling our growth pipeline. APS has a lot of project-based business and our growth pipeline depends on winning a spot on the next automotive platform launch with the next color design. One KPI that we track is the number of color and concentrate request we service. In Europe, the number of requests increased by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter relative to our performance in the second half of 2022. We still have a long path to complete our transformation, but our team is making tangible progress in delivering improved results. In early July, we completed our acquisition of the Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled high-performing technical compounds located in Italy and Poland. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our strategy to be the leader in providing sustainable solutions for our customers. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter.Peter Z. E. VanackerThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segments on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $79 million reflected higher licensing revenue and lower catalyst volumes. In the third quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will moderately improve. As a result, we estimate that the third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the quarterly results seen in the first 3 quarters of 2022. As discussed in the previous earnings call, we expect that LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology will be a key enabler for scaling up our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant in Cologne, Germany is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and announced an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Please turn to Slide 20 and I will discuss the market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that the challenging market conditions of the second quarter will continue for the remainder of the year. And the America's fundamental demand is [stepped] and we see cautious buying from our customers and consumers. Margins are expected to be pressured by near-term volatility in feedstock costs and new capacity. The potential for energy cost volatility and associated consumer caution looms over the European markets, despite moderation in feedstock and energy costs relative to 2022. In China, strength in Consumer Services has not been sufficient to offset slow recovery in durable goods, infrastructure and export activity. Markets are not reflecting much benefit from the initial stimulus measures. Demand for consumer packaging is stable, supported by the service industries. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels cautiously low. Building and construction markets are relatively flat with benefits from new housing starts offset by reduced sales and maintenance for existing homes as owners resist trading into higher mortgage rates. We're watchful for tailwinds in the United States from stimulus enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act, to Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act. Demand from automotive market seems to be gaining momentum. However, there may be some headwinds from the typical downtime at OEMs in the third quarter. Oxyfuels and refining markets continue to see stable demand as refined product inventories remain low. At LyondellBasell, we optimize our well-positioned assets across the world. We will continue to align our operating rates with market demand and steered through all stages of the business cycle. Now let me summarize our second quarter outlook and our long-term strategy for our company with Slide 21. Our second quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value to our new strategy despite challenging markets. Margins for our O&amp;P businesses moderately improved amid tepid demand. Although lower than the first quarter, our oxyfuels and refining margins remained above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. Cash generation in the second quarter was outstanding with $1.3 billion in cash from operations and an impressive cash conversion of 103% over the past 4 quarters. We returned $508 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate soft demands and additional polyolefins capacity in North America and Asia will lead to further margin compression. We expect LyondellBasell's third quarter EBITDA will be mid-teen to mid-20 percentage points lower than the second quarter. We remain watchful for near-term risks and opportunities across sectors and geographies. At our Capital Markets Day in March, we shared our excitement arounds our new forward strategy. And during the call today, we provided updates on our progress to capture incremental value across the 3 pillars of the strategy. I want to emphasize that we are not allowing current conditions to slow us down. Our value enhancement program has generated incredible energy and enthusiasm across our workforce. From frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions to sales and support teams serving our customers around the world. LyondellBasell VEP is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. We're making steady progress on our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonGreat. Just taking a step back on Slide 14. You had a pretty solid 2Q in the Americas. But at the same time, as you've been consistently highlighting, there's been a lot of volatility in NGL pricing, there's going to be a difference in operating rates in the second half. There's a little bit of a choppy macro picture. Just when we're thinking about integrated olefin margins, just how should we be thinking about the run rate for the second half and into 2024? Just one, you are taking a look at the current dynamics? And then any comments on how you expect this to eventually inflect and improve, hopefully, next year.Kenneth Todd LaneYes, Chris, thanks for the question. Like we have said in the remarks that we made, we do expect it to be volatile. So the good news is we've seen NGL prices come down. That was really peaking in July, but we do see that coming off here in August, but it did have an impact in July. That's not going to continue. The inventory levels for NGLs are still very healthy and production is growing. So overall, we expect that we're going to see advantages with NGL production here in the U.S., especially with ethane. Now having said that, we still do have a lot of new supply that's coming into the market. And at the end of the second quarter, we saw prices in the Americas coming down and that's going to continue into the third quarter, let's say, it's going to carry into the third quarter. We've seen some green shoots in the export market. So I think we're kind of bouncing along the bottom here. But it's just going to support that theme of continued volatility going forward. What I would expect is that we're going to see that normal seasonality going into the fourth quarter, some weakness on volumes. Q1 will typically be a little bit better. And then when we get into the second half of next year is when I expect to start to see things really improve.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.Patrick Duffy FischerQuestion around the export split versus sales in North America. So if you would -- maybe 3 parts. So where are you guys on that split? Where do you think the U.S. industry is and then when you think about the 3 plants that are going to start up or are in the process of starting up, where do you think their split will be in their first year of operations?Peter Z. E. VanackerThat's a very good question, Duffy. Let me hand it over to Ken on the olefins and polyolefins side.Kenneth Todd LaneDuffy. Yes, so listen, we have traditionally been lower in terms of a percentage for exports in our portfolio, and you see that this year. Now some of that as well is driven by the turnaround that we've had in the first half of the year. We've got some of our capacity down right now in the Midwest. So we've been a little bit lower on the export sales in the first half of the year. As an industry, the Americas or the U.S. typically is exporting somewhere around 35% to 40% of the capacity. Normally, when these new assets come online, you're looking at them exporting significantly above that level for the first year or so as they work their way into the market. But I don't see any change in the midterm around the industry being at that 40% level of exports, but it's always our goal to find the highest value for our products. And that is in the domestic market. So our focus is on serving the customers here and building out a portfolio that is more resilient by supplying domestic.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneYes. This e-cracker concept that you're pursuing, is that fair to assume that this would require a complete rebuild and not a retrofit. And if so, how do you look at the economics of that approach versus these multiple hydrotreaters that you have at your refinery that you could produce renewable [matagorda], particularly if the DOE goes along with your hydrogen hub proposal.Peter Z. E. VanackerThank you, Steve. Very good question that you're asking. I mean what we are doing here together with our partners is, first of all, developing the technology further into, let's call it, a semi industrial scale. So this is not replacing, but it is feeding into a cracker. Next to that, of course, we are following different other avenues in order to prepare ourselves, I mean, for more renewable hydrocarbons. And here, that's what we are looking at, at the refinery and how can we leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have. So there will not be one solution fits all is the key message, but we are playing, let's say, very broadly, being technology agnostic, and investing in the different types of technologies that eventually where we then would decide to invest in those technologies on an industrial scale. We're talking about 2013 plus in my view. Then, of course, there can be different solutions depending on where you are in the world.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.Stephen I. RichardsonI was wondering, if you could ask on APS, Torkel. I appreciate the update. I was wondering if you could maybe remind us of some of your longer-term goals in terms of restoring profitability. It sounds like you're making some good inroads. And then also I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about more if acquisitions should be expected to be persistent part of the outlook there or if this is something unique.Torkel RhenmanThank you. So as we communicated, our target is to get the business to what we believe is very feasible that the $0.5 billion earnings by 2027. And that's the plan that we have embarked on. And I have to say we are at the current moment right as I expect us to be. I've led multiple business transformations, and this is where I expect us to be at this time. So if you look at our earnings performance, I think fourth quarter of last year was the bottom, and we have then 2 months behind us where we are gradually improving it, but it is a multi-year effort for us and we're feeling the growth pipeline, as I mentioned, is our #1 priority, and we're making good progress, but that also takes time. But it is our focus. In terms of acquisitions, the Mepol, I think, was an acquisition that perfectly fit in, but there is nothing else that we have -- that we are in that sort of category for our space at the moment.Peter Z. E. VanackerAnd here -- it's Peter. I mean just to add to that, I mean, in terms of the acquisitions, I mean, one needs to look at the Mepol acquisition, being at the boundary, the interface between circular and low-carbon solutions and then the APS business with the compounding. So Mepol has a very strong mechanical recycling position in those different markets, and that's what made it so attractive for us to do that acquisition.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.Arun Shankar ViswanathanJust wanted to follow up on your outlook for O&amp;P margins across both North America and EIA. So it calls -- it looks like you're calling for double-digit declines in your profitability in Q3 sequentially from Q2. Can you just walk us through some of those mechanics? I know that we had the $0.03 decline in June on polyethylene. Are you looking for further declines in Q3? And just wondering, given the feedstock volatility there as well and then the recent decline in ethane prices, or is it continued weakness in volume? Or is it a little bit of both? Or maybe just walk us through some of the mechanics.Peter Z. E. VanackerYes. Maybe first of all, let me repeat what has been said in the prepared remarks is that we have an outlook, I mean, for Q3, which we believe will be mid -- mid-double digits, so mid-teens to mid-20s, lower in terms of EBITDA compared to Q2. And why that relatively broad range still because as you know, I mean, we have a very broad portfolio of different products. And we've seen a bit of improvements in the refinery markets. On the one hand side, we continue to believe, I mean, that we will have strong oxyfuel margins as Kim mentioned in the prepared remarks. But then, of course, I mean, with the volatility that you see in the olefins and polyolefins markets and then China still not being back as it should be at this point in time right now. So we will then, of course, fine-tune that towards more at the end of the quarter. When you Michael will speak on a conference, and then we'll give a further update on where we are standing, I mean, in that quarter. So with that, I mean, on the O&amp;P maybe answer that question as well. I mean, Ken, if you can give some additional?Kenneth Todd LaneYes. Like I had said previously, we're looking at the feedstock kind of peaked in July. So that definitely is going to hurt us versus Q2, if you think about it sequentially. Also, like I said, with prices coming down in the U.S. at the end of Q2, that's carried into Q3, so both of those are going to be headwinds. Then there is some volume component to that. Q2 is normally our peak volume in terms of seasonality and in Q3, especially in Europe, in the summer months, you start to see the volume slow down. So we will have some volume slowdown in Q3 as well. Overall, I expect that we are, like I said, bumping along here on margins in Q3 in terms of being at the bottom.Michael C. McMurrayAnd then what I would remind investors is that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally weak to the third. Just as a reminder.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Aleksey V. YefremovGovernment in China recently included the plastics industry, specifically in their economic support program, just very recently. Do you have any insight into how the support actually is implemented in practice. It sounds like you haven't seen much benefit so far. But -- just any color on specific program maybe that you have would be helpful.Peter Z. E. VanackerYes, ALeksey, I mean, we have seen a couple of areas where that eventually could have an impact. But at this point in time, it's too premature to say, I mean how much that impact will be. Our people, as you know, they are on the ground, following that. There seems to be talks around, automotive industry, talks about white goods industry, but too premature, I mean to say because we need -- we've seen a couple of these initiatives so far, but we are rather in a wait-and-see position now and ready. If the market would see an uptick because all the initiatives so far have not had the impact as we would have hoped despite the fact, I mean, that the saving rates of individuals is extremely high, I mean, in China.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.Frank Joseph MitschI had a question on I&amp;D. You noted in your slide that you're anticipating a $20 million headwind in 3Q from turnarounds, but also you indicated that you're shutting down 2 PO/SM plants for both the months of July and August, I assume that, that's not included in that guide. So I'm just curious what sort of financial impact we should be anticipating with the shutdowns of the PO/SM facilities and are you awaiting a return in demand before you bring those facilities back up? Any more color there would be very helpful.Peter Z. E. VanackerYes. Very good question, Frank. And of course, I mean, like we have done last year as well. We don't call this, let's say, cost savings, but I mean, we call this, I mean, we look at what is happening in the marketplace. You know that with our PO/TBA capacities and especially the new one that we have brought on stream successfully. We have the lowest costs and also lowest carbon footprints, propylene oxides in the world. So it's clear, I mean, that the PO/SM facilities are more kind of playing a role of a swing capacity. So with that, I will hand over to Kim to give more details.Kimberly A. FoleyFrank. Thank you, Peter. Let me just add a little bit more color, as Peter alluded to, when we provide the guidance, the guidance was really to help investors understand the difference of bringing on this new PO/TBA capacity and relative to the other capacity that we would be taking offline for maintenance. And we really looked at that from the PO/TBA technology. So that you can see both the PO impacts as well as the oxyfuel impacts because they're almost offsetting, which is what you see in the guidelines. We talked about a 50% run rate for the new plant versus the maintenance of the other assets. So when you ask about what's the impact of the PO/SM market or assets going down, I think the way to think about it is where is styrene today. Styrene is oversupplied, it's changing month-to-month on very, very thin margins. So what -- how I would answer your question, Frank, is I don't think there is an impact based on PO demand of those plants idling at this point in time based on the durable demand for polyurethanes regionally as well as globally.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsQuestion within your wide range of EBITDA guidance, you have sort of a single point targets for operating rates. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about operating rates given they fluctuated a fair amount, a lot more than normal over the past 12 months. And so what are you solving for with those operating rates versus the profitability you're seeing?Michael C. McMurrayIt's pretty simple, Vincent. We're matching supply to demand. I wouldn't say it any other way.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.Michael James LeitheadQuestion on O&amp;P EAI. Historically, if I look back, this business did about $1 billion or more of annual EBITDA. And now it seems like profitability is likely going to be a bit below that for some time, just given energy dynamics and some of the new supply that's coming on in Asia. So just -- if we take a step back, how are you thinking long term about the competitiveness and profitability of your assets there?Peter Z. E. VanackerYes, Ken, I mean, if you can take that question?Kenneth Todd LaneYes. So listen, of course,(inaudible) the headwinds in the European business with energy like everybody else has. And we're focused on generating the highest value from those assets because there are things that we can do through our VEP program that still does generate good value from a margin standpoint. We've seen probably the biggest headwind in Europe around demand. So volume is down pretty significantly year-over-year. As you can imagine, the whole inflation equation has hit the consumer very hard in Europe. So we believe we've got good competitive assets there. But of course, we're operating at a very difficult market. We're going to look for ways to continue to improve the value that we can get from those assets. In the longer term, we're always looking at our portfolio, and we'll continue to do so and make sure that we have the most competitive position that we can with reasonable amounts of capital that we would have to deploy there.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairI had a question on just the longer-term PE outlook. Some of the consultants are showing global capacity growth in about the 2.5% range for 2024 through 2026, which, as you know, is about half of what we've seen recently. And so my question is, do you -- what are your expectations? Do you believe this forecast? Do you think this number will creep up? Or is it too late to really see any meaningful increase in like the 2024 and 2025 numbers, specifically.Peter Z. E. VanackerWell, Matthew, I mean, normally, you have quite a good visibility, with the announcements of capacity increases. So -- and that visibility in our industry is normally around what, 4, 5 years, down the roads. I would be very surprised, if there would certainly be additional capacities that come on stream, within that period that have not been announced because that's not how the industry is working. I mean, Ken, with regards, to the announcements now in terms of supply and demand.Kenneth Todd LaneI -- the only thing I would add to that, Peter, is we have seen some projects starting to slow down, right? So we are hearing about that in the market. And look, I'll remind you, too, we always get into these down cycles, and it happens every time. And it feels like you're going to be here forever but there will be capacity that also comes out of the market. So yes, there are some additions that are going to come. And some of those are going to make sense depending on their feedstock position and the region that they're in, but there are going to be some capacities that come out. It takes a couple of years for that to happen, but that's how the cycle works. So in the short term, I don't expect there to be any significant change in capacity coming on. But in the midterm, I do think you're going to see some projects start to be slowed down.Peter Z. E. VanackerAnd then if you look at it from the demand side, if you look into the history, than with the financial crisis 2008 and 2009, then certainly in 2009 and 2010, you had a big recovery. So growth was higher than it normally is, let's say, over the cycle, let's say, around, I mean, 4% per year. And the same we've seen, also with the pandemic in 2021. During the second year, you saw a recovery with -- when you compare that to 2020. So we continue to be just looking, from a historic point of view. We have a consumer behavior. It could very well be that also then we see in the future that there's going to be higher demands compared to, to the average over the cycle demand growth of about 4% per year on polyethylene.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse.Unidentified AnalystWill the delay in closing the refinery pushback the time frame to achieve the $1 billion EBITDA from circular plastics? I assume you're going to be later in converting some of the gasifiers and so forth at the location.Peter Z. E. VanackerThe clear answer on that is, John, no. It's not. Our target remains unchanged in the circular and low-carbon solutions business as we have communicated on the Capital Markets Day and we have been evaluating that option, obviously, exactly if you did our Capital Markets Day, so it was on the radar screen.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasI think a couple of years ago, in Advanced Polymer Solutions, you were earning about $300 million. And today, I guess the quarterly run rate is about $1 billion, and maybe you're making $10 million in EBIT. What happened to that business? And in your forecast of $500 million in EBITDA from circular polymers, what EBITDA margin do you expect on that? Or what EBITDA margin does that number is still...Torkel RhenmanThank you for the question. On the APS -- and as I covered when we had the Capital Markets Day, I think we've really lost the focus on the business and our customers when we went through the integration. And we took out a lot of cost and synergy but this is a business that really requires this customer centricity. It's a project-based business. You have to have a really good growth pipeline and a very, very good service level and that's the recognition that I think from the whole integration that we made some mistakes and we really have not put together this transformation plan to met -- to deliver what this business can perform. And that's the journey that we're on. And I'm confident that we're going to deliver on it. We're making good progress. But it is a transformation, it will take (inaudible) years.Michael C. McMurrayAnd then Jeff, it's Michael. One of the things that I'd add, if you're looking at current year results versus historic results, remember, at the start of this year, we removed 2 relatively significant businesses from the APS segment and put it back in O&amp;P. So that's not an apples-to-apples comparison if you're looking at this year versus history, just as a reminder.Peter Z. E. VanackerAnd to your question, I mean, on the circular business, Jeff. I mean the $500 million in -- by 2027 and then the $1 billion by 2030. When we talked about that on the Capital Markets Day, you know that we are talking about 2 million tons of target by 2030. The margins that we talked about, I mean, you can do the back of the [info] calculation pretty much, is incremental EBITDA on top of the EBITDA that we normally make, in our crackers. So it gives you a bit of guidance also here. I must say, we're -- we look at the margins that we are creating, today with that business, you know that since we started the business, we have been able, to grow the business quite substantially. Of course, albeit, I mean, still at a low level compared to the overall volumes that we are having in the polyolefins. We see that the margins that we can capture or substantially higher than what we have said, at the Capital Markets Day. And again, it's a separate business that is being created. I keep repeating that. Like I said at the Capital Markets Day, with its own supply and demand that has its own value-based pricing mechanisms that we are positioning in the marketplace. So this is not a market where you have a polyolefin plus a premium type of approach.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.Hassan Ijaz AhmedJust wanted to revisit the earlier question around polyethylene exports out of the U.S. Look, I mean, a lot of this capacity that's been coming online in the U.S. has been with an eye to the export markets. And as you guys and others have talked about, the European market isn't looking great. Asia hasn't rebounded the way one would have expected it to. So, are you seeing a scenario where some of that product that was meant for the export market isn't making its way to the export markets and potentially is putting further downward pressure on PE pricing in the U.S.?Peter Z. E. VanackerOne of the things, Hassan, that we have seen already since the end of last year, and this has maybe also a bit to do, with some learnings out of running a business like that in a pandemic environment, is that there has been substantially more disciplined in the marketplace. So just like we, as a leader in the industry, have reduced, the output instead of pushing products into the market. Others have done, the same thing. So you see a change, in my view, in terms of behavior compared to the history. Ken, anything you want to add?Kenneth Todd LaneI completely agree with that. And like I had mentioned before, there will be headwinds with this capacity coming on. There always is. But the capacity comes on one time and then you feel it and the market will adjust to that. I also said earlier, we're seeing some strength in some of the export markets, especially going south. So we're starting to see some growth in some markets like Brazil that's going to help absorb some of that capacity. So I'm not any more concerned about it now than I was 6 months ago. Southeast Asia is even looking a little bit better. We've seen that trend over the last couple of months. So the markets are going to absorb it over time. And like Peter said and Michael had said, we'll adjust our operating rates to optimize cash.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.Peter Z. E. VanackerOkay. Thank you very much. As usual, very thoughtful questions. We're looking forward to sharing the updates on our progress towards unlocking additional value, of course, over the coming months and we wish you all a great weekend. And as usual, stay safe. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

However, adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29.The company’s net sales in the second quarter were $10,306 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,396.5 million. Net sales decreased around 30.5% from $14,838 million in the prior-year quarter.During the second quarter, global olefins and polyolefins margins experienced an improvement, primarily due to lower feedstock costs in the United States and Europe. The commencement of LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and oxyfuels plant in Texas contributed to new capacity but this was offset by planned maintenance at the company's existing assets. Oxyfuels margins remained strong during this period, supported by low butane costs and a strong demand for fuels. However, refining margins declined from the highs seen in the first quarter of 2023, though they remained above long-term averages.LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

QuoteSegment HighlightsIn the reported quarter, the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins — Americas division experienced a year-over-year decrease in EBITDA of approximately 28.8% to $679 million. The decline was attributed to lower margins. The segment's revenues amounted to $2,727 million, slightly below our estimate of $2,845 million.Similarly, Olefins &amp; Polyolefins — Europe, Asia, the international segment witnessed a decline in EBITDA to $84 million from $186 million in the prior-year quarter. Lower margins in the Polyolefins business, caused by weak demand, resulted in this decrease. The segment's revenues reached $2,729 million, above our estimate of $2,451.6 million.Story continuesIn the Intermediates and Derivatives segment, EBITDA decreased approximately 30% year over year, amounting to $472 million. This decline was due to weaker propylene oxide and derivatives results due to lower demand. Sales were $2,662 million, higher than our estimate of $2,513.4 million.The Advanced Polymer Solutions segment's EBITDA was $34 million, down from $42 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower Compounding &amp; Solutions volumes resulting from weak demand.

The company returned $508 million as dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.OutlookIn the third quarter, LyondellBasell expects soft demand due to ongoing economic uncertainty to offset the usual benefits from summer seasonality. Challenging petrochemical margins are being influenced by stagnant demand, volatile feedstock costs and increased capacity in North America and China. However, the company anticipates attractive oxyfuels and refining margins, supported by summer demand for transportation fuels. During this period, LyondellBasell plans to maintain average operating rates of 85% for North American olefins and polyolefins (O&amp;P) assets, and 75% for European O&amp;P as well as Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets, in accordance with global market demand.Despite the current challenging economic conditions and a slower recovery in China, the company remains committed to its long-term strategy.

Despite signs of a resilient economy with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising 2.6% in the second quarter, moderating inflation with the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by a quarter percentage point, and solid corporate earnings, the markets appeared to be under “constructive rotation”.The downtrend was further hastened over the past couple of trading sessions with credit rating agency Fitch trimming the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating for the U.S. to AA+ from AAA, citing “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years”. However, investors have broadly taken the decline on a positive stride as fundamental views about the economy, in general, remain relatively strong.With uncertainty becoming the norm, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like General Electric Company GE, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages.

259,62a06694-5611-3c92-bfdd-34d889c80d98,UNH,2023-08-05,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 89% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-nyse-unh-130117279.html,1691154077,STORY,['UNH'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, UnitedHealth Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 17 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of UnitedHealth Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that UnitedHealth Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at UnitedHealth Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in UnitedHealth Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.6b worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

While we currently expect the transaction to close in mid- to late August, the closing remains subject to shareholder approval and conditions being satisfied or waived. Lisa?Story continuesLisa PalmerThank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. We again had a really strong quarter, in fact, one of the strongest and most active quarters in Regency's history. Our success came from all facets of the business, including leasing, development starts and, of course, the Urstadt Biddle merger announcement in May.I said many times since we emerged from the pandemic, that Regency is so well positioned for sustained growth and that we're on our front foot ready to capitalize on opportunities. Our achievements in the second quarter reflect this. They reflect the exceptional work of our team, supported by the strength of our portfolio, the current retail environment and our balance sheet position.As we all know, there is still uncertainty in the macroeconomic landscape, but at Regency, we've not seen any signs of softening. As evidenced by our results, the fundamentals of our business remain very healthy and operating trends are strong. From a leasing perspective, tenant demand is robust, and the second quarter was one of our strongest quarters ever, and it's supported by sustained momentum in our LOI and lease negotiation pipelines.Tenant bankruptcies are playing out as we expected, but importantly, our exposure to these retailers is limited. From a capital allocation perspective, most of you know that we have been acutely focused on ramping our development and redevelopment activity back to our strategic goal of a pace of $200 million to $250 million of average annual investment.I'm really proud and gratified by the success demonstrated by such a strong second quarter for new project starts. Nick will discuss our activity in more detail, but creating value through development and redevelopment has always been a core competency of Regency, and it is a competitive advantage for us that is often overlooked.As I've said before, I believe we have the best team and platform in the business. And with ground-up development, we can really move the needle in an environment where new supply of high-quality centers is lacking. Even as we ramp our activity, our pipeline will continue to be self-funded on a leverage-neutral basis with free cash flow, driving accretion and a sustainable component of our earnings growth above and beyond the organic same-property NOI growth that are high-quality, well-located properties are generating.With regard to Urstadt Biddle, we're proud of this transaction and are excited to integrate both the shopping centers and many of their people into Regency. These centers align so well with our own and meaningfully expand our presence in these strong trade areas in the Northeast. The teams on both sides are working hard to effect an efficient and timely merger close.As Mike will discuss, we expect it to be immediately accretive to our core operating earnings, and we also look forward to unlocking value within the combined portfolio under the umbrella of our leading national leasing and asset management platform. Another highlight of the quarter was the release of our annual corporate responsibility report in late May. This report is a synthesis of our commitment to ESG and the many initiatives driving us forward. We are extremely proud of the progress that we continue to make towards achieving our long-term goals. The principles of our program are embodied throughout our organization and are integral to achieving our strategic and financial objectives.Before I turn it over to Alan, I'll reiterate that Regency is very well positioned in this environment given the strength of our assets, the trade areas in which we operate, supported by the solid fundamentals of the grocery-anchored suburban shopping center business today. Our liquidity and balance sheet position will allow us to remain opportunistic driving sustainable cash flow growth going forward. Alan?Alan Todd RothThank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We continue to benefit from a strong retail environment as demonstrated by another quarter of fantastic operating results, particularly on the leasing side. New leasing volume year-to-date is 40% above our historical average. And in the second quarter, we achieved our highest shop new leasing volume in over 10 years.As a result, we increased our shop leased rate by another 60 basis points sequentially to 92.7%. Our overall same-property leased rate is up 10 basis points in the second quarter despite 60 basis points of occupancy loss due to bankruptcy, further validating the strength and quality of our portfolio.Exceptional second quarter leasing activity also came with strong cash rent spreads of 12% on a blended basis and nearly 30% on new leasing. Our continued success with contractual rent steps is reflected in our GAAP rent spreads of 20% on a blended basis. This strength in our operating trends helped us drive another successful quarter for same-property base rent and NOI growth.Tenant demand is coming from a broad range of categories, including but not limited to grocers, off-price, medical, restaurants and pet services. Our signed but not occupied pipeline represents over $30 million of annual incremental base rent, and our same-property occupancy spread remains wide at 250 basis points.Even as executed leases commence each quarter, we continue to replenish our SNO pipeline with the execution of new deal. As we look ahead, our leasing pipelines remain full, with another 1 million square feet under LOI and lease negotiation.Our second quarter activity did include a mix of larger space deals with longer lease terms, which resulted in elevated per square foot leasing CapEx. But importantly, net effective rents remain in line with our historical average. With regard to backfilling our former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond spaces, we are executing our vision and making excellent leasing progress. You'll recall that our exposure at the time of the bankruptcy filing a quarter ago was 50 basis points of ABR.Two of our locations were purchased at auction by Burlington and Michael, and we have fully executed leases on 3 additional spaces. We have significant interest on the remaining spaces and our team is actively negotiating with multiple prospects, including the in-process pursuit of redevelopment projects at a couple of the locations.Overall, we anticipate marking them our rent by approximately 20% to 25% on average for our former Bed Bath stores. As we've noted previously, we feel confident in our ability to re-lease our high-quality real estate when tenant bankruptcies occur often at higher rents and upgraded tenancy.In closing, we recognize that our success in the second quarter is not only reflective of the current environment and the strength of our assets but of the hard work of our best-in-class leasing and operating team. We see that momentum continuing as we work in the coming months to integrate Urstadt Biddle's people and high-quality properties and create even more value through the combined portfolio. Nick?Nicholas Andrew WibbenmeyerThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We had a very productive and gratifying quarter for development and redevelopment activity. We started several exciting new projects and made great progress on leasing and construction across our $400 million in-process pipeline while maintaining costs, returns and timing consistent with our underwriting.We also continue to build our future pipeline of projects and see meaningful opportunities for incremental investment. In the second quarter, we started 12 new development and redevelopment projects totaling $175 million. That is an impressive amount for Regency, and I'd like to thank our development teams for their efforts.As these projects start to reflect years of hard work behind the scenes, getting us ready to commence construction at these sites. The first project I'd like to highlight is SunVet. The $90 million Whole Foods-anchored ground-up development on Long Island that we spoke about last quarter. The properties in (inaudible), New York and located on the heavily trafficked east-west artery of Sunrise Highway, which is the dominant retail corridor in the market. Construction commenced on the 170,000 square foot center in May, and we anticipate Whole Foods opening in 2025.We already have signed leases with Starbucks as well as Citibank and have seen significant leasing interest from many other best-in-class retailers. In the second quarter, we also started Phase 3 of our redevelopment of Serramonte in Daly City. This project will allow us to transform the Northeast quadrant of the property, including the redevelopment of the former JCPenney space with a world-class Asian food market as well as the development of 2 new small shop buildings adjacent to Macy's.We continue to see significant demand throughout all components of this asset and look forward to even more value creation in the future. We also commenced redevelopment of our Whole Foods-anchored, Mandarin Landing in Jacksonville, which will include a new 25,000 square foot Baptist Health Medical Center, additional shop space and a new two-tenant pad building.In addition to the development and redevelopment starts, I'm appreciative and proud of the work our teams have done completing 5 projects during the second quarter, which will collectively contribute more than $5 million of annual rental NOI. The largest of these projects was our $55 million redevelopment of the Crossing Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia, where our leasing and construction teams did an amazing job further solidifying the asset at the center of gravity in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor. The project is now 100% leased with an incredible tenant mix, including a new state-of-the-art flagship lifetime, which had a very successful opening a few weeks ago.Looking ahead, our teams are laser-focused on sourcing new investment opportunities. These include redevelopments within our existing portfolio as well as new ground-up development projects. The 3 cornerstones of Regency's development strategy, our capabilities, our capital and our contacts are more relevant than ever in the current environment.Our leading grocers continue to expand, and we are one of the few developers that have the ability to help them execute on their desire to locate with a new high-quality shopping centers throughout the country. We continue to build our pipeline to achieve our strategic objective of more than $1 billion of project starts over the next 5 years of our expertise and our long-standing relationships, combined with our access to capital, uniquely position us to capitalize on opportunities. Mike?Michael J. MasThanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with highlights from our second quarter results, walk through a few changes to our current year earnings guidance, provide some estimates for accretion related to our pending Urstadt Biddle merger and finish with some comments on our balance sheet position.We grew same-property NOI by 3.6% in the second quarter after excluding the impact of COVID period reserve collections. Importantly, the largest driver of growth continues to be base rent, contributing 380 basis points to the NOI growth rate in the quarter. As we've continued to stress on previous calls, base rent growth is the most important indicator of our portfolio's performance.And in Q2, our growth was driven by the combination of embedded rent steps, positive releasing spreads, growth in occupancy and redevelopments coming online. Turning to 2023 guidance. As I'll refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our earnings presentation. Driven by another strong quarter of leasing, incredibly strong, if I may add, and greater clarity around the current operating environment and bankruptcy impact. We've raised the bottom end of our same-property NOI growth range as well as our ranges for NAREIT FFO and core operating earnings.With more certainty at the margin, we have eliminated some previous downside scenarios. Our updated same-property NOI growth range is now 3% to 3.5%. While we've maintained our total credit loss assumption at 60 to 90 basis points, we now expect a greater contribution from average commenced occupancy, benefiting from strong shop leasing through the first half of the year and absorption more than offsetting the negative impact from bankruptcy closings.Same-property NOI is the primary driver of the $0.01 increase in the midpoint of our core operating earnings guidance range. With the Bed Bath auction behind us and the outcome of those stores now known, we now have clarity on impact from the acceleration of below-market rents tied to those locations.For the full year, we anticipate roughly $6 million of accelerated below-market rent within our noncash guidance, about half of which has been recognized year-to-date. Our full year noncash guidance also includes $3.5 million of expected impact from the reinstatement of straight-line rent associated with the conversion of cash basis tenants back to accrual up slightly from a quarter ago. As a result, we've raised our assumption for noncash items to plus or minus $37.5 million, positively impacting our NAREIT FFO range, the midpoint of which is up $0.02. For those that are undoubtedly starting to think about 2024, we consider both of these items, combining for $9 million to $10 million of noncash revenue this year to be nonrecurring in nature.And speaking of nonrecurring items, our guidance for COVID period reserve collections for 2023 remains unchanged at $4 million. As we thankfully reached the last of our collections on deferral agreements, and with only 5% of our tenants on a cash basis of accounting today, we are not currently anticipating any material COVID period collections to recur in 2024.These updated guidance ranges and the details I just reviewed remain on a Regency stand-alone basis only and do not yet factor in any impacts from the Urstadt Biddle transaction, which we expect to close by the end of this month.We will provide updated current year guidance with more detailed assumptions on a pro forma basis when we report our third quarter results, so more to come. But in the meantime, we are prepared to offer a high-level outlook. Our expectation is to deliver incremental per share core operating earnings accretion of $0.01 in 2023, reflecting about 4 months of impact and plus or minus 1.5% accretion for the full year of 2024, which continues to include an estimated $9 million of annual G&amp;A cost synergies.Importantly, this accretion estimate is for core operating earnings, not NAREIT FFO as it does not include any impact to noncash items. The teams are making excellent progress with integration prep, and we're all excited for the merger closing and the future prospects of the combined company.I'll finish by highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, which is the foundation of our capital allocation strategy. With one of the strongest balance sheets in the overall REIT sector, our leverage remains at the low end of our targeted range of 5 to 5.5x debt to EBITDA and will remain so following the close of Urstadt Biddle merger.We are generating significant free cash flow, expected to approach $150 million this year, self-funding our growing investments pipeline that Nick highlighted previously. And we have access to meaningful liquidity through our $1.25 billion line of credit with less than 10% of our total debt maturing through the end of 2024.I can't stress enough the importance of our balance sheet strength and allowing us maximum flexibility throughout economic cycles and providing us an ability to remain opportunistic as the team executes on our investment strategy.With that, we look forward to taking your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citigroup.Craig Allen MailmanLisa, I just wanted to touch base on the transaction market. Clearly, I know you guys have UBA in the pipeline here. But a lot of your peers have been talking about maybe a little bit of a sign in the acquisition market. I'm just kind of curious what you guys are seeing if there's even an appetite to buy one-offs or if the focus now is just on redevelopment pertaining within the portfolio and what you guys are going to bring into the portfolio after the merger closes?Lisa PalmerYes. I appreciate the question, Craig, but my first order of business is going to be to toss that to Nick.Nicholas Andrew WibbenmeyerCraig, I appreciate the question as well. So yes, as you guys have been hearing and seeing close activity definitely still remains then, but there's no question. We're seeing the pace of opportunities coming to market accelerating and that bid-ask spread is tightening.And so we are starting to see data points come up somewhere in the range of low 6s to 7s on a cap rate. But on certain deals, we're seeing them definitely even drop below 6 depending on the growth rate and the size. And so we are actively pursuing these opportunities, underwriting them, understanding them.And as always, if we see an opportunity that we think is equal or accretive to our quality and growth rate and accretive to our earnings, then we're ready to move forward. As Mike just indicated, we have the capacity to do so.Craig Allen MailmanGreat. And then just shifting to leasing. You guys had some good absorption here in the shop portfolio. I'm just kind of curious just monitoring whether the bagging issues have had any impact. Just are you guys seeing any particular vertical of tenants maybe backing off here? Or is the access to capital not been an issue at all and it kind of continues to be across the board, demand for that the shop space?Alan Todd RothYes, Craig, it's Alan. We have not seen any backing off just yet. And so there's been no impact to your backing question at all. In fact, I would take us to our pipeline, which we feel really good about where we have nearly 1 million square feet still in the pipeline that is in active negotiation right now. So nothing just yet.Craig Allen MailmanOf that 1 million square feet, how much of that would be shop? And where could we see that lease rate kind of tick to in the next couple of quarters?Alan Todd RothIt probably leans more towards shops on the pipeline side, Craig, but it's really across the board just in both anchor and shops in terms of the activity. I think there's a lot of junior box retailers that just haven't had the ability to identify spaces given limited supply and, of course, the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is I think, opened a bit of that. So again, I think it's really -- it's addressing the totality of the portfolio, but leaning towards shops.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Sanket Agrawal with Evercore ISI.Unidentified AnalystSo I just -- I was just curious around leasing activity. As we saw that leasing activity picked up again in second quarter after being low in first quarter. So we just wanted to understand how are the leasing conversations as of today and as we model spreads for second half and into '24?Alan Todd RothCan you just repeat the last part of that is you're seeing an uptick? Sanket?Unidentified AnalystSo basically, leasing activity were up this quarter, right? So we just wanted to know like what are the -- as model spreads for second half of this year and for '24? What are the leasing conversations on the ground today?Alan Todd RothSo Sanket, I'll go ahead and see if I can answer that question. So the leasing conversations on the ground still remain really positive. We're very proud of, I think, the certainly, the spreads that we achieved in the second quarter. I think as you saw, it was almost 30% on new leasing.And I think really a lot of that was a function of the mix of our anchor and shops where we had a little bit more on the anchor front. But if you look at just the shop spreads for the quarter and you're going to take a few of those anchor deals out, we were still in the mid-teens, which is really exceptional.And I'd probably bring you also towards our GAAP rent spreads, which were 44% and again, really outstanding for the quarter. And I think that ties into the focus the team has on embedded rent steps and really speaks to the strength of the market to your question.Lisa PalmerAnd I'd come back to just our opening remarks is just the overall strength of our business in suburban, especially grocery-anchored shopping centers. And anecdotally, we are hearing that with inflation abating some, our tenants are benefiting from that as well from a cost perspective. And also there's been improvements on the labor front. So with all of that, again, that's the leasing conversations on the ground. We don't have any hard and fast evidence, but it is anecdotal, and we do have great relationships with our offices across the country and with our people really close to our centers. So again, we see continued strength at this point.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And I have a follow-up, sir. As you guys expect to close the UBP, Urstadt Biddle acquisition this quarter, so did you guys like study the difference in base rent or is that Biddle's portfolio has versus your portfolio in similar markets? So what is the gap there behind how much you guys are trying to acquire on that side as you take over that portfolio?Lisa PalmerI'd just bring you back to, again, that we're really excited about integrating these properties into our portfolio under our platform. As you heard us say when we announced the merger, and as I think we just reiterate it today, we do believe that there is going to be some upside from leasing and really capitalizing on bringing that into the Regency leasing and asset management platforms.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.Ki Bin KimIf I can start off with a really boring question. Can you just help me go back to that below-market rent topic? How should -- you had a little bit more in this quarter. How should that trend throughout the year? I'm just curious if there's going to be a bigger burn off point at some point in '23 or '24?Lisa PalmerKi Bin, before Mike answers that, there are no boring questions, and there are no bad questions.Michael J. MasI will limit my spot to '23. I mean much more to come on '24 as we finish out the budgeting process but this -- which will kick off later this summer, and we'll offer more guidance later this year.But you bring up a good point, I mentioned on the call, there will be a burn off really targeted to the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond spaces in particular. So we are anticipating losing another $1 million of noncash income just simply related to them in the second half versus the first.So you should plan for that as we think about our full year guidance. And hopefully, that helps you with what you're looking for on that item, plus in my prepared remarks with respect to the reinstatement of straight-line rent as well, not recurring.Ki Bin KimOkay. And at high level, California is obviously your biggest market. And I'm just curious if there's been any discernible trends in terms of traffic or spending patterns when you compare California to your other markets and kind of any standouts?Nicholas Andrew WibbenmeyerSure. Thanks for the question. This is Nick. So definitely not seeing any difference in California to the rest of the country. We're seeing strong demand across the board, and that is inclusive of California, in all aspects of California. And I would even point out even in the Bay Area because again, the majority of our properties are in the suburban markets that are still seeing significant demand. And so we're very, very pleased with the activity, the demand and the leasing velocity we're seeing out west.Ki Bin KimAnd if I could squeeze a quick third one here. The New York MSA occupancy dropped at 82%. Was that just deleasing for development or anything you can share on that?Alan Todd RothKi Bin, I think that, that's the vacating of our grocer in Manhattan, The Food Emporium deal. So again, we can't announce who that tenant is, but we've already executed a lease to replace a majority of that space, so more to come in the next quarter.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.Unidentified AnalystIt's Eric on for Juan. According to your prepared remarks, it sounded like you had 60 bps of occupancy loss related to the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond potentially other bankruptcies. I was just kind of curious on your expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year?Michael J. MasEric, from a percent lease perspective, I mean, this has changed from last quarter. Last quarter, we were communicating an expectation that by year-end, percent lease could be actually down modestly as a result of that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond filing. But given the team's incredible leasing activity in the shop category in the second quarter, we're now anticipating being up modestly as a spot percent lease rate by year-end.So super excited about that here at Regency. However, from a commenced perspective, we are anticipating that, that commenced spot rate at year-end is going to be slightly down and that's only a matter of time as we deliver the assigned and nonoccupied pipeline going into '24. So really, the seeds that were planted in the second quarter and the leasing that the team delivered from a leasing perspective, that's all going to pay dividends for us as we turn the calendar and move into '24. Not to mention the fact that we're making incredible progress on the releasing of the vacated Bed Bath stores as well.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the snow pipeline, that $30 million of ABR. Could you just talk a little bit more about the timing of that commencement there in '23 and then into '24?Michael J. MasSure. Yes, you've got a 250 basis points, about $31 million of rent. That's about 3% of our ABR. And I'd say it's roughly half by year-end this year and all of it -- nearly all of it by the end of next.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That's helpful. And then last one for me. just given the acceleration in the leasing spreads, both on a cash and a rent per GAAP basis. I was wondering if you could just quantify the annual bumps in the second quarter? And is that a new trend? Is that expected to be the floor there? Any color on that would be very helpful.Michael J. MasWhat are we getting -- sorry, Alan, what are we getting in from a leasing bumps perspective in our current activity?Alan Todd RothYes. No, Eric, thank you for that question. We are getting 100% of our new deals had steps this quarter. So very proud of that number and appreciative that the team has embraced the importance of embedded rent steps. And I would say 2/3 of those deals had escalators that are at 3% or more. So we are seeing a pretty good shift, Eric, on that front.Michael J. MasAnd then from an impact perspective, Eric, 140 basis points of our base rent growth is coming from rent steps. And that's been pretty consistent for us for a long time now as the team has done an exceptional job of embedding growth into our leases. We are -- based on this momentum and we're pushing this every single day, we're hopeful to move that impact going forward.But it is a tough mountain to climb, and it is that -- moving that impact to same-property growth north from where we are now, we'll take some time, but the teams are doing great work.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.Viktor FedivThis is Victor Fediv here on Greg McGinniss. I have a question on what does a typical leasing agreement look like now and how it has changed, if at all, during the last 3 months in terms of concessions, escalators and GIs?Alan Todd RothYes. Victor, thank you for the question. I would say it certainly has shifted a bit in the landlord arena, I think, as evidenced by some of the results that you're seeing. But from a market perspective, we're not seeing capital go up just in terms of the market shifting that.For us, specifically, quarter, it's gone up moderately because of just the mix of deals that we did this quarter, leaning more towards the anchor side. But generally speaking, as occupancies certainly rise, we feel pretty good about the quality of the portfolio, our ability to really choose the right retailers as we always intensely asset manage our portfolio and continue with what we perceive as fair market terms.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.Anthony Franklin PowellA question on bad debt. I think you kept your bad debt guidance the same. Other -- some of your peers have reduced their bad debt guidance given kind of the better expected regression here. Your is lower than others, but what are you seeing there on that front?Michael J. MasAnthony, I appreciate the question. We left our guidance range unchanged, correct. What I would say there is actually, let's get some stats out here first. 60 to 90 basis points of our credit loss reserve.Remember, I think we all are familiar with this by now, but that's coming from 2 different line items, right? So you're losing base rent from the bankruptcy impact, but you're also recording bad debt expense unrelated to the bankruptcies, right? That's what's comprising the 60 to 90 basis points.2/3 of that guidance is from bankruptcy impact, the balance coming from traditional bad debt and I would say we're about 30% of the way through that estimate at the midyear, so at June. Let me say this, if nothing else were to happen from this point forward in the bankruptcy arena, we'll probably end up closer to the 60 basis points out of that range.And it does feel as if the -- as we all have talked about in the past, bankruptcies do tend to be seasonal. It does feel like more of a first half of that than the second. But we're in uncharted territories here, so we're just being a little bit careful with that range. But 90 basis points would be satisfactory to kind of capture any unforeseen kind of negative impact that could happen in the back half of the year.Anthony Franklin PowellGot it. And then maybe one more on development. It seems like the sector is doing very well here. Are you being approached by private equity firms or other sources of capital to do more development? This is a pretty strong fundamental sector, and you guys have obviously been successful in developing. So I'm curious what you're hearing there.Nicholas Andrew WibbenmeyerAnthony, this is Nick. I appreciate the question. So there's no doubt right now the financial markets are a challenge for most developers. We all talk about liquidity challenges, the tightest liquidity is in construction loans.And so that is really an opportunity for us. And as I said in our prepared remarks, our capabilities, our capital and our contacts, and we mean that are all very necessary to make deals happen right now. They're really tough to make developments happen for a plethora of reasons. But that's why we feel really bullish we're going to get more than our fair share of opportunities.And so we have pondering in from everyone in the business, whether it be capital interested, whether it be developers that need capital and the good news is we already have all the tools in our tool belt, and we're using those as appropriate. And so excited about, obviously, bringing SunVet online, started construction this quarter and hope to announce future deals in the future.Lisa PalmerAnd we -- again, development has been an important part of our business model for as long as I've been at the company, and it just enhances our earnings growth with $150 million of free cash flow and we can essentially leverage that remaining leverage-neutral and invest that capital into our development, it really does move the needle with regards to enhancing our earnings growth.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemJust a couple of quick ones. So just starting on the sort of the recurring or nonrecurring stuff this year versus next year. Just trying to get my arms around that. So I mean, I think it sounds like the collections of past reserves and certain noncash items is going to be the biggest sort of tough stuff to comp next year.But from a cash basis, whether it's same-store NOI whether it's some of the occupancy gains, is that fair that should be closer to sort of your long-term targets?Michael J. MasYes. I mean Ron, it's Mike. Just to maybe catch some of the items you're referring to. We want to -- and we try to make it very clear in the remarks. There's $9 million to $10 million of noncash FFO that won't be recurring. And I wouldn't plan on that recurring next year, driven by the straight-line rent reversals as well as the below-market acceleration.There's another $4 million that we've guided to from a prior year collection perspective, and we're thankfully getting to the bottom of that bucket. So collectively, you're in the $14 million range of nonrecurring FFO items. And that's why we will continue to look through the core operating earnings to, again, remove the impact of those -- of that noncash component.So that's a better reflection of what we think AFFO direction should be. And then the prior year collections will take care of themselves.Ronald KamdemGot it. Makes sense. And then so I mean, I think going back to -- I think some of the comments you made about the UBP merger, presumably, you're not going to have any more of these headwinds on the same-store NOI guide. So presumably, I mean, I think '24, if you look past these noncash items, I mean, it could be a pretty strong sort of year, right? So what are sort of the like the puts and takes, right? Is it bad debt that we should be thinking about? Because everything else seems like it's going to be pretty strong.Michael J. MasYes. I'd appreciate you mentioned it. I'm going to be a little careful, Ron, and we've talked too much about 2024. We're going to give that as we customarily do a full suite of forward-looking guidance later in the year. So I want to kind of be careful there.But from a rent steps perspective, as we just talked about, we will continue to deliver positive impacts just from contractual rent increases. We're having a great year so far on rent spreads. In this year alone, that's an 80 basis point positive impact. I would anticipate that rent spreads continue to positively impact us going forward. Commenced occupancy, we still have room to run. There was a question earlier today about the top end. 96% on total and 93% on shops is where our eye level is. That would include the to-be merged portfolio of Urstadt Biddle, which -- which will take some more time for us to achieve those levels. There spot occupancy levels at about 200 basis points below ours today, and that's what we're excited about driving growth from that portfolio. Something you didn't mention is the positive contribution from redevelopments. We schedule that out in our supplement, 70 basis points to 2023 of positive NOI contribution. We've brought online key projects at The Abbot, Market Common Clarendon. These are exciting large projects that we've brought online, and we've been talking about for -- it feels like years now, and they're finally coming into fruition and through income. Those will continue to grow for us into next year as well.And there will be the impact of bankruptcies as a negative impact this year, and we'll make an adjustment from a credit loss perspective looking into '24. But as you know, our exposure to these tenants just from a watch list perspective, is pretty limited. So that's about what I want to share today on '24 outlook, and we'll give you much more to come, both on the merger as well as on our base outlook for '24 later this year.Lisa PalmerBut probably important just to reiterate, I know you mentioned the opportunity in increasing the commenced occupancy in the UBP portfolio. But in case you missed the prepared remarks, Mike did say that we expect 1.5% COE accretion in 2024 from that merger.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van DijkumI had -- you guys -- Regency is -- your DNA historically has always been development. You're leaning into development now when nobody else can when demand still sort of exceeds supply, if you will. So I think that bodes well for your future. And I see that you're doing a couple of different types of development, including repurposing a former anchor box at a mall and you're doing some -- it looks like some residential. I don't believe you're doing the residential yourself at Westbard or are you doing that? Could you remind us again what's -- how you look at residential and how you try to stick to your knitting and typically would let others take the risk in noncore property types?Lisa PalmerAppreciate the question, Floris. And I also appreciate the comments. You are correct. We are focused on the retail portion of development. It is our core competency. It is our competitive advantage. It is what we are really good at. And yes, there are going to be a mix of uses when we are focusing on some of the highest quality pieces of property and land.Oftentimes, there will be demand for other types of uses. And when that is the case, we're certainly going to capitalize on that, but it is not our specialty. So we will typically partner with someone who -- that is their core competency. And it may mean that we just invest the land. It may mean that we invest a little bit of capital, but we will always bring in the expertise that is needed to ensure that we have the fulsome project and optimizing the land.And we have examples of that, as you said, Westbard is one. We have one out in California where Nick is where we've partnered with Holland to do the residential across the street from the Grove, which is everyone is familiar with it. We've rebranded it to Bloom on Third.So absolutely. I appreciate the question, Floris, and you are right. We are focused on the retail portion of high-quality mostly grocery-anchored suburban shopping centers.Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van DijkumAnd then I guess my follow-up here. I wouldn't consider California market as the state. It has a couple of different markets in there. But New York clearly is going to be your biggest market, particularly post the Urstadt Biddle merger. Is that correct?Lisa PalmerYes, if you say markets and not a state, that is correct. And again, I think it's really we like the portfolio, the composition, our geographic diversity. The fact that we have offices across the United States. And we're very focused on trade areas, as you know, not necessarily macro markets. And we will continue to invest in the markets that we are already invested in when we have the opportunity to add high-quality shopping centers to our portfolio.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.Michael William MuellerSo you spent a little bit more time. It seems like with the Urstadt portfolio. Just curious, how are you thinking about, say, the 3-year same-store NOI CAGR potential compared to the existing Regency portfolio?Michael J. MasYes. Mike, sorry, I'm going to prevent the team turning to answering the question. More to come on the close, we're not closed yet. We have spent more time with it. We're as excited as we have been since we announced the merger and since we started to look at it. None of that has changed. It's only accelerated and amplified.As a matter of maybe disclosure guidance, we actually at this point in time, don't anticipate including it in the same-property pool. We will likely treat it as an asset acquisition. So your -- the technical question, how will impact our same-property growth isn't necessarily relevant. But we're excited to talk about the portfolio when it's time to do so.OperatorOn the line of Wes Golladay with Baird.Wesley Keith GolladayI just want to look at a high-level view of 2024. Just trying to find any potential headwinds. And more in particular, for the redevelopments, are you going to be deleasing anything of material size next year that you know of at this point?Michael J. MasWes, I think I've talked to the headwinds we want to talk about already, and they're largely coming from the noncash area. So the $9 million to $10 million of nonrecurring noncash impacts. We've talked about the $4 million of prior year collections that also won't recur.That's where we're going to limit our conversation today. The redevelopment impact, I mentioned previously, just again, directionality, we will continue to see that as a positive contributor going forward. And the details of that are in the supplement and you can map that out.Wesley Keith GolladayOkay. Fair enough. And then I guess, more bigger picture. There are definitely a lot of developers struggling, see where SOFR is and what their proper need for development yield is quite high. What are the -- are retailers coming to you saying, ""Hey, could you just step up your pipeline? "" Are you having those conversations? Are they willing to give you a higher yield? Could you take your pipeline up higher? Are you governed by maybe your free cash flow capacity? What's the outlook for maybe accelerating the development pipeline to a much higher level than it is today?Nicholas Andrew WibbenmeyerSure, Wes. I appreciate the question. This is Nick. There is no question we are in direct dialogue with our partner grocers around the country. The grocers want to continue to add stores. Their business has been very good over the last several years, and they're excited about continuing to grow their top line.And so there's no question, but there are challenges making those deals pencil and there isn't one solution to solving all those challenges. Part of it's construction cost, part of it's entitlements, Part of it is financing cost. Part of it is rent. And so our job and our capabilities allow us to stand in the middle of all of those and make sure we're pulling every single lever using every tool in our toolbox, which is why I would tell you, we're as excited as we've been in a long time about getting more than our fair share because we are one of the only companies in the country that have all of those tools, have those capabilities, have those relationships and have that knowledge.And so we're bullish on growing the development pipeline in the cycle right now. I'm sorry, go ahead, Lisa.Lisa PalmerSorry, Nick. No, I thought you were finished. Keep going.Nicholas Andrew WibbenmeyerI was just going to allude to, as Mike indicated, we have plenty of capacity. And as Lisa indicated, we have free cash flow is prioritized for it, and we have a balance sheet behind that to make sure we can appropriately continue to lean into those opportunities as we put those pieces together.Lisa PalmerYes. All I was going to add is that we haven't been limited from capital, it has been a limitation on the opportunity set because we're really disciplined. And I think it's important that we maintain that discipline, and we will maintain that discipline. If it gets to the -- and Nick reminds me all the time because I do -- I like to say my $200 million to $250 million that it could be lumpy and there may be some years where it's going to be more than that, there may be some years where it's going to be a little bit less.If we can average the $1 billion to $1.25 billion over 5 years, that's our goal. And if it gets to the point where there would be opportunity set is growing, we will certainly evaluate how we can meet that demand.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.Linda TsaiI think your retention ratio was historically around 75%, and it's trending above that now. Are you getting back to peak occupancy? Are you above that?Alan Todd RothLinda, it's Alan. We are still hovering in that...Unidentified Company RepresentativePeak retention rate. She just clarified your question.Lisa PalmerPeak retention rate.Alan Todd RothWe are still -- let me answer -- let me -- let me go in reverse then. So in terms of are we back to where we think peak occupancies are, no, we believe there's still runway. We're making really good progress. Obviously, some of the bankruptcies that we alluded to the 60 basis point impact did sort of pull us back a bit despite the great success we had on a lot of shop leasing. But there's runway there. We feel really good about, again, as I said, the pipeline of where we're going.And I hope not only do we get back to historic highs, but we can get past this. That's certainly where we're setting our eyes.Lisa PalmerThe only thing I'd add on retention is, and we've talked about this, the pandemic really kind of purged some of the weaker operators. And so as we emerge from that, we've done a great job of recovering our occupancy.We continue to do that. We continue to increase it. And we feel better today about the strength and health of our operators, and I think we ever have in the past. So it does not surprise me that the retention rate continues to be strong, and I would expect that it will continue to be -- to stay there, if not improve.Linda TsaiAnd then when you look out to the next year or two, how do you think about the ratio of organic versus external growth in terms of having the best opportunity sets?Lisa PalmerAgain, $150 million of free cash flow, we will leverage that and invest that into our development and redevelopment activity. And so that's where you're going to see our external. And as Nick said earlier, we will always be evaluating acquisition opportunities. And to the extent that we can fund it so that it is accretive to earnings.And if the opportunity itself is neutral -- at least neutral or accretive to our quality and our future growth rate, we're going to act on them. So I think you can take our same-property NOI and the team does a great job of communicating that via our investor presentation as well as the meetings. If you take our same-property NOI model, that's the base. That's the fundamental. And then on top of that is going to be our investment activity, and that will enhance that growth.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithMy question relates kind of to the balance between new leasing and your ability to pay TIs. Are tenants looking for greater TIs, I thought it stepped up in the quarter. And just given the macro environment, maybe other landlords don't have as much capital available to help their tenants out. Is that helping you become a landlord of choice for certain types of tenants?Alan Todd RothMichael, I appreciate the question. Look, we will invest in great retailers that we know have a great track record that we've done tremendous business with. But when you talk about sort of the uptick that we've experienced for the quarter. As I mentioned, it really is a little bit more just in terms of the mix of anchor and shops.We -- as noted in the supplemental, you'll see the weighted average length of term is also longer. So I would bring you back to how we're thinking about net effective rents as a percent of GAAP rents where we're in the mid- to high 80% range over the last 5 quarters and for this quarter, we're at 83%.So it's really still really in line with how we are prudently managing our capital spend, and we foresee it sticking in that similar range as we go forward.Michael GoldsmithAnd just as a follow-up related to small shop. Clearly, another big quarter with a sequential step-up of 60 basis points. Is there an artificial cap on how high small shop occupancy can get historically, it's been lower than anchor, but we just seen such strong movement lately. It sounds like you have a great pipeline there. So is there a point where we just kind of reach a moment where it may be -- it just doesn't move that much higher and are we approaching that?Alan Todd RothMichael, I would say for all of our leasing agents that are listening to this call, there is no cap on our shop occupancy in the direction that we're going. But sure, we're going to still obviously have some vacancy as even when we meet those historic highs or get past those.But again, it's historically been in the 93-ish percent range. And as I said previously, we feel pretty good about the direction that we're going with the pipeline that's in place right now.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments.Lisa PalmerI just want to thank you all for joining us this morning and bearing with us through the end of this earnings cycle. Have a great weekend all. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

Operating income was $19.4 million, up from the prior-year quarter’s $16 million.During the reported quarter, revenues from the Engineered Solutions segment totaled $72.2 million, up 6% year over year, and topped our estimate of $69 million on stronger-than-expected demand from existing customers as well as new business wins.

Standard Motor has revised its outlook for adjusted EBITDA at around 9.5% of total revenues, which is down from the previous estimate of roughly 10%. This projection takes into account several factors, including an anticipated increase in expenses linked to customer factoring programs that are estimated to range between $48 million and $50 million based on current rates. Additionally, the outlook considers the influence of startup costs and duplicated overhead costs associated with the recently established distribution center mentioned earlier. Furthermore, the company’s international operations are expected to face a headwind due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.Peer ReleasesGenuine Parts Company GPC delivered second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share, up 10.9% year over year.

265,33e16894-2c3f-39f9-85af-828f47d22761,PG,2023-08-05,Inflation fight: Consumers are starting to push back against higher prices,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/inflation-fight-consumers-starting-push-203234918.html,1691181154,VIDEO,"['PG', 'KHC', 'KO', 'CMG', 'CAG']","[Many companies raised prices in order to keep up with inflation. Now, those companies say they are going to stick with those higher prices despite seeing some pushback from consumers. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma what companies such as Coca-Cola (KO), Chipotle (CMG), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and others said in their earnings calls about maintaining higher prices.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Inflation showing signs of easing, which is welcome news to consumers. But from what we've seen so far in earnings season, many consumer giants are planning to keep prices high. Joining us now with a recap is Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. I know one of those companies that we talked about heading into you, heading into the break was Coca-Cola. But you've got a litany of them. And this is not welcome news for consumers For the companies, maybe.BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. But let's hear a little bit more. Because we're seeing ultimately what's happening here is these heavy hitter consumer companies like Coca-Cola ultimately raising prices. And consumers finally are putting their foot down. And we're seeing that in volume growth, or lack thereof rather. So at Coca-Cola, let's take a closer look at pricing. We saw a pricing increase 10%, but volume remaining flat. Now, in the call, they did say in developed markets like North America and Europe, they're seeing some willingness among consumers to switch to private labels, which is obviously not good news for them.And so in these particular markets, they said that our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. Now, moving right along, I mean, we're seeing this similar trend at Procter &amp; Gamble. They're pricing up 7%, volume dropping 1%. And P&amp;G CEO telling Yahoo Finance, ever posting its quarterly results, that this was a quote, ""very, very modest decline,"" which they would expect with the level of pricing that they've been taking. But they did hint at more on the call. He did say that pricing isn't going away in the absolute. It's linked to innovation. So they have a very strong innovation pipeline underway, which will ultimately cost more for our consumers.Story continuesConagra Brands, that's behind Birds Eye and Duncan-- Duncan Hine rather. They took a pretty significant price jump up 17% year-over-year. Now, the words that they used rather was inflation. Justified, they did see volumes drop as a result of that. And as you can see there, I mean, they noted that pricing peaked in Q3 due to their actions to offset that cost of goods. And they're estimating-- and they look-- as they look out to the end of the year, they're saying a slowing rebounding of volumes as prices start to ramp. But they do expect ultimately to keep up with those higher prices.And Kraft Heinz has decided to hold off to some higher prices. They did see net sales rise 2.6%. But volume is down there as well. And ultimately, the company did say that they are continuing trying to catch up with very high inflation costs, that they are a leader within the category. And so they had to make the decision. And they will do it all over again to raise prices.AKIKO FUJITA: Brooke, what are we seeing on the fast food, fast casual restaurants? I'm thinking back to a name like Chipotle, which was one of the first to step up and raise their prices.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Well, Akiko, we saw them actually miss on same store sales in their recent earnings report. And they were one of the first to raise prices. And earlier this year, in the springtime, they did say that they were going to hold off. But in the latest earnings report, that was in question among investors, especially on the call. They held up, and they sort of defended. CEO Brian Niccol saying that, I think we've proven time and time again that the brand is very strong, and the value proposition is very strong. And as they get closer to that fourth quarter, we'll make a decision on exactly what we want to do on that pricing front.So investors are certainly questioning whether or not that was a right choice to keep pricing in place earlier this year. But we're seeing this across the board at McDonald's here in the US. They benefited from strategic menu prices and positive guest counts, they called out. And earlier this week, when we talked to Starbucks CFO, they said that in the Q4, they will lapse those price increases that they took last year. And they'll see a more normalized return of price increases of 1% to 2%.But certainly, what we're seeing here is a bit of consumer pushback. We're seeing sort of that make way into same store sales as well as we do laps these price increases that fast food and consumer giants have taken.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. I'm going to make my coffee at home. Just kidding. Someday. Today, I am-- today, I had Starbucks though. Friday treat.]"

Robust pricing initiatives have been vital in boosting sales for industry participants. The companies remain focused on digital commerce growth, product innovation and brand building strategies.Nevertheless, the companies continue to toil with headwinds related to higher manufacturing and logistic costs, increased commodity costs, and lower volume. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending have been denting profitability. Companies like Unilever PLC UL, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. CHD, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG and Colgate-Palmolive CL have resorted to cost-curtailment actions to counter cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies manufacturing and supplying fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry. The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products, deodorants, and oral care items. The household category covers home care products, including laundry care, house cleaning agents, bleaching products, air care, dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items. Laundry detergent is one of the largest markets among the ones mentioned above. A few players also offer baby and feminine care items. Some companies offer pet care products. These companies market and sell products through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, distributors, wholesalers, department stores, drugstores, specialty stores, dollar stores, pet stores and websites.What's Shaping the Future of the Soaps &amp; Cleaning Materials IndustryFavorable Demand &amp; Pricing Actions: The soaps and cleaning materials industry has been experiencing revived demand trends across markets. The industry participants have been benefiting from solid demand for products and brands, stemming from continued brand relevance. Gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives are also driving organic sales for several industry players. The companies have been adopting bold pricing initiatives across markets to combat rising costs due to the persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes. The cost-based pricing actions have been boosting the margin and profitability of several industry players.Product Innovation &amp; Strategic Efforts: The companies frequently invest in product development to cater to the consumers’ changing needs. Investments in innovation, product portfolio and digital capabilities have been the key to driving companies' sales in the soaps and cleaning products space. Players have been undertaking pricing, packaging, marketing initiatives and restructuring actions, including acquisitions and divestitures. Companies also remain focused on expanding into new markets and channels. Developing products with eco-friendly and natural ingredients is another area of focus among industry players, as consumers increasingly prefer environment-friendly ingredients in their daily use items. The increase in popularity of online shopping, particularly after the pandemic, has been another key sales driver for the industry participants. This has led the companies to constantly step up their efforts in the e-commerce arena through improved delivery and payment systems. Consumer goods companies are also undertaking productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.Rising Costs a Concern: The industry participants are experiencing supply-chain disruptions, logistic issues and inflation in raw materials and other expenses, which have been weighing on their margins and profitability. Elevated manufacturing and distribution costs and increased advertising and sales promotion expenses are other factors impacting margins. Also, several companies are subject to higher SG&amp;A expenses due to increased operational costs related to salaries and bonuses and planned investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. Some players focus on cost-containment initiatives, including streamlining the supply chain and minimizing overhead costs to improve margins. Most companies are resorting to price increases to cushion their margins.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust ProspectsThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

267,2ba74b66-f7d5-38fd-b70a-0d6f6153128f,PG,2023-08-05,The Procter & Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-companys-nyse-pg-130106554.html,1691154066,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble's (NYSE:PG) stock is up by 3.2% over the past week. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Procter &amp; Gamble's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Procter &amp; Gamble is:32% = US$14b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.32 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Procter &amp; Gamble's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Procter &amp; Gamble has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Procter &amp; Gamble's moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Procter &amp; Gamble's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 4.1% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Procter &amp; Gamble Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Procter &amp; Gamble has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 59%, meaning that it is left with only 41% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 57% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Procter &amp; Gamble's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 36% for future ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Procter &amp; Gamble's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Henley Passport Index relies on the number of destinations passport holders can access without a prior visa. With Visa Free access to 192 locations, Singapore dominates its ranking. At the start of 2023, Japan ranked number one. However, according to the latest updates, it has fallen to third, whereas Germany, Italy, and Spain are in second position. While Henley Passport Index is accepted as the authority on this subject, it does not include factors such as quality of life and economic conditions of the country. So, in this article, we will list the most powerful passports in the world according to our methodology.In the post-pandemic world, passport rankings are changing rapidly. As restrictions imposed due to Covid subside, some countries are becoming more open towards travel and tourism. This is also evident in the post-pandemic revenue growth of airline companies like American Airlines  Group Inc. (Nasdaq:AAL). The war between Russia and Ukraine has also impacted Passport rankings that rely solely on visa-free travel. After Russia invaded Ukraine, several countries dropped their visa requirements for Ukrainian passport holders, who now have access to 143 destinations without a visa. It sits at the 30th position in Henley Passport Index.Factors affecting a country's passport powerUkrainian passport has an interesting dilemma. On the one hand, it grants visa-free travel to a large number of destinations. On the other hand, Ukraine is at war with Russia, its economy is taking a hit, and current living conditions are far from ideal. The Global Passport Index by Global Citizen, which also gives significant weightage to the investment index and quality of life index in its ranking, ranks Ukraine at the 60th position. According to our methodology, Ukraine ranks at 58th position. With the dilemma of Ukraine in mind, one must wonder what makes a country’s passport more powerful than others. Story continuesAccording to a report published by Henley &amp; Partners, Income is the most reliable predictor of a country’s passport power. In general, countries with higher GDP per capita enjoy fewer travel restrictions than others. The concept of ‘economic dividend’ comes into play here. The passport holders of these countries have higher spending power which is beneficial for the countries they visit. The report also claims fragility to be a good indicator of passport strength. However, unlike GDP, it works in the opposite direction. Countries such as Syria and Iraq, which are unstable and face terror attacks and militancy, consistently rank low on all passport ratings. It is worth noting here that Ukraine is exempted from this rule because of geopolitics. US passport's diminishing strengthAlmost half of America’s population plans to travel more in 2023, compared to 2022. At the same time, America’s passport power is diminishing. Amongst the countries sitting in the top 10, the United States has secured the least additional visa-free travel destinations in the last 10 years. The travel and tourism industry is an important component of the US economy and it is closely related to Passport strength. Before Covid in 2019, it contributed to 2.9% of the total GDP. The diminishing power of the US passport may hurt the growth of its Airline sector. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) reported a -62.12% revenue growth in 2020 because of Covid and travel restrictions. However, it reported revenue growth of 72.38 and 63.88% for the subsequent two years. While airline companies like American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) are likely to grow, their growth rate can be jeopardized by the decreasing power of US passports. let's now move to the list of the most powerful passports in the world. Also read 15 Most Powerful Currencies in the World.25 Most Powerful Passports in the World Our Methodology For our rankings of the most powerful passports in the world, we considered two passport indexes. The first is Henley Passport Index by Henley and Partners, a UK-based consultancy. The second is Global Passport Index by Global Citizen, an investment migration firm. Henley passport index uses visa-free travel as its primary indicator of the passport’s strength. It gives a score of 1 for every destination the passport holder can travel to visa-free. A score of zero is given for each destination the passport holder requires a visa for.The global passport index by Global Citizen uses three metrics to rank passports. The first index is Enhanced Mobility which considers visa requirement type and the quality of life at the destination the passport holder can secure. Enhanced Mobility Index is given a 50% weightage to the overall score. The second index, with a 25% weightage, is the Investment Index. It is a general assessment of the country’s economy. The third is the Quality of Life with 25% weightage. For our rankings, we gave equal weightage to both rankings. We assigned a score of 1 to the passport ranking 1st, 2 to the passport ranking 2nd, and so on. We did this for both indexes and then averaged out the score. The closer the score is to 1, the stronger the passport. 25 Most Powerful Passports in the World 25- LiechtensteinOur score - 14.5Located between Austria and Switzerland, Liechtenstein is a small country with around 39,000 people.

274,0d869fed-4173-3b39-8e5c-c88be550d824,AFL,2023-08-05,Inflation affects employee mental health. Here’s how Aflac is supporting its workers through it,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-affects-employee-mental-health-125814261.html,1691153894,STORY,['AFL'],"[Good morning!It’s well established that the U.S. is facing a mental health crisis. And a recent report from Aflac, showing a gap between employers’ perceptions of their mental well-being offerings and what employees actually need to battle burnout, illustrates just how little organizations understand the worker mental health crisis. Add to that other stressors like higher inflation squeezing workers’ paychecks, and it’s little surprise why employee mental well-being is declining.CHRO Daily spoke with Aflac chief human resources officer Matthew Owenby about Aflac’s findings and what the insurance company is doing to improve the mental health of its 12,800-strong workforce.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: More than a third (37%) of employees say they have delayed mental health treatment because they don’t know if their health insurance plan covers it. How can employers ensure employees are aware of and use these benefits?Matthew Owenby: Employers just don't do the greatest job of communicating. They tend to [share] package benefits information in the last quarter of the year, when generally annual enrollment picks up, rather than monthly, maybe even bimonthly, or at a lunch-and-learn, or in a web article or blog.Employers need a much more targeted, focused, and modern communication program. I'm older, so you won't necessarily communicate with me via Facebook or Instagram. Employers have to use the tools their employees normally would use to get information and communications. We've got to keep information in front of employees, especially when it's new.How does financial instability affect employee mental health? And what do employees need that employers are not providing?Your financial wellness directly impacts your engagement and satisfaction with your employer. It also creates what we refer to as background stress and anxiety. You have this weight on your shoulders. If employers cannot provide benefits or compensation to address it, they can provide information workshops on the tools [and] capabilities people need to better manage their financial lives.Story continuesAt Aflac, we have regular lunch-and-learns, where we teach people about financial wellness, financial knowledge, how to budget and stick to it, how to reduce your debt, and things you can do proactively to support your financial well-being. It has a huge impact. The reason why people are working, mostly, is because they need financial security. So if that isn't a part of the program you're offering as an employer, it's a really big opportunity to step up.Benefits costs are also rising for employers, and part of that increase can be attributed to a greater need for mental health care. How can employers address this need for mental health support while keeping costs manageable?They can invest in mental health resources before it becomes a crisis and expensive to insure. Providing resources and getting to people before it becomes a broader issue is far more financially meaningful to the corporation and the employee than allowing an unchecked situation. It's like a cancer diagnosis; you would rather detect it early. The math around early detection versus late detection is materially different. It's no different from a mental issue.How are you addressing mental health before it becomes a crisis at Aflac? We have on-site health care as well as mental health counselors. We offer paid family leave, hybrid work, and paid medical leave. But to us, those are table stakes, frankly. If you don't happen to work here in Columbus, Ga., we have resources that employees can connect to virtually, just as if they were here.How often do you communicate these benefits to employees?At least twice a month. And we ramp it up at different times of the year. For example, you're going to get more communications around flu season.How do you measure the success of benefits offered to your employees?We measure it primarily by asking: Do we have a happy and engaged workforce? Are they productive? Do they continue to work here over time? Are our engagement scores high, and where do we want them to be? Are we taking care of people? The fortunate thing is we have such a communication of transparency, relationship, and trust that if someone working here has what we would call a countercultural experience, they'll come to find me. They'll walk right through my door, unabated, and let me know about it.Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results were on track with expectations, and we have made solid progress towards achieving the consistent full year growth that our share owners have come to expect from our company. As we continue our long-standing track record of consistent execution, we have several areas of progress to highlight that will also serve to reinforce our strong investment thesis. Our focus on 2023 began well before the start of the year. As we shared last quarter, we took actions in the latter half of 2022 to advance our resource plans and added additional focus on cost management and resilience. We are pleased with the positive results from those efforts. The results are clearly shown through the advancement of key regulatory filings, great progress we've made on our major capital projects, and our expectation to reduce 2023 O&amp;M compared to 2022. And we continued our focus to derisk 2023 in the early part of this year by successfully mitigating rising interest rates through our convertible debt offering and interest rate hedging. In addition, we have seen strong core operations year-to-date. I am incredibly proud of the great progress our team has made in the first half of this year. We have seen remarkable advancements across all fronts including our focused efforts on operating a safe and resilient energy grid, our commitment to advancing clean energy and our unwavering dedication to delivering exceptional service to our customers and communities. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Lisa Barton, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more details on our investment and operating progress. And Robert will close the call with more updates relating to our financials and regulatory progress. But before I do that, I'll highlight a couple of key themes from this quarter. We continue to make exceptional progress advancing our investments that make our energy network efficient, reliable and resilient. We remain a leader in the renewable energy sector currently ranking nationally as the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind assets. We are continuously investing in a more diverse generation portfolio, prioritizing both value and reliability in our energy supply. A great example of this is our recently approved 175 megawatts of battery storage projects, which will complement our solar investments at Wood and Grand Counties in Wisconsin. We continue to excel in power quality and reliability as recognized by J.D. Power. Our ongoing efforts and results are centered around enhancing the resilience of our energy grid through the undergrounding of our distribution system. We continue to achieve new levels of efficiency in this area and have undergrounded more than 25% of our distribution system, further solidifying our commitment to a more robust and secure infrastructure. We are actively pursuing the exploration of cutting-edge technologies to establish energy storage capabilities, highlighted by our advancement of a first in the United States long-duration storage system at our Columbia Energy Center site. As we anticipate the retirement of the Columbia coal-fired energy center in 2026, we are committed to leveraging the existing infrastructure and interconnections at this site to promote resilience. The project has generated significant excitement within our organization, serving as a prime illustration of our commitment to pursue federal funding and embrace innovation to contribute to a sustainable future. We remain agile and proactive in identifying and capitalizing on financing opportunities that arise both at the federal and state level. Simply stated, we continue to execute our forward-thinking strategy and are consistently delivering financial and operating results. Our strong results are made possible by our dedicated employees. Every day, they work tirelessly to fulfill our purpose, which is to serve our customers and build stronger communities. Their exceptional contributions throughout the past year have been truly incredible. I want to thank and recognize them for everything they do. We eagerly anticipate another year of strong financial and operational performance and we deeply value your ongoing interest in our company. As a result of our team's efforts, our strong investment thesis remains. Our first half 2023 results are on plan. We have reaffirmed our annual earnings guidance and we remain committed to delivering on our long-term consistent 5% to 7% growth in earnings and dividends. I will now turn the call over to Lisa.Lisa M. BartonThank you, John. One of the areas that drew me to Alliant Energy revolves around our unwavering commitment to delivering value in a holistic and sustainable manner and our dedication to ESG principles. We are resolute in our long-term commitment to consistent growth in ensuring a successful clean energy transition for our customers and communities, making a positive difference in the lives of our customers and communities is a core value and guides us as we navigate the evolving energy landscape. We recently released our 2023 corporate responsibility report, showcasing our commitment to environmental stewardship, meeting the social needs of our communities and corporate governance. With a diverse portfolio of generating facilities, we consistently provide reliable energy to our valued customers while continuing to broaden their access to zero fuel cost and carbon-free energy resources. As we advance our clean energy initiatives, we prioritize competitive rates, reliability, system resiliency, sustainability and innovation. We partner and invest in organizations which proactively advance our industry's knowledge and collaborate on best practices. Now let's review our great environmental progress from 2022. First off, 40% of the energy we supply to our retail customers in 2022 was from renewable sources. Second, we reduced our annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel generation by 39% from our 2005 levels, evidence that we are well on our way to achieving our goal of a 50% CO2 reduction by 2030. We reduced our water usage by 50% from our 2005 levels, demonstrating our progress towards our 75% reduction goal by 2030. Looking forward, we have updated our clean energy goals to reflect our company's progress and strategic plans to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. On Slide 3, we highlighted examples of our sustainability efforts. Over the years, we have made significant strides in reducing our carbon footprint by transitioning from older, less efficient coal units to cost-effective and efficient generation resources, such as wind, natural gas, battery storage and solar. These resources not only demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability, but also served as lower cost options for our service territory, providing value for our customers well into the future. Building upon our successful wind energy expansion, our strong project management execution capabilities, we are focusing on expanding our solar energy portfolio. With our substantial investments totaling 1.1 gigawatts of solar projects, we are set to become the largest owner-operator of solar energy in Wisconsin. In 2022, we successfully placed 250 megawatts of solar capacity into service, and we are on schedule to add an additional 840 megawatts by mid-2024. Our investments are helping customers focus on their sustainability objectives in the communities we serve. With our customer-hosted renewables projects, we partner with businesses or communities to host an Alliant Energy solar farm on site. Two examples are with the Iowa State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In partnership with Iowa State, we are also investing in agrivoltaics, the study of crop or livestock production underneath or adjacent to solar panels. Through our community solar program, we created community funded solar sites bringing the cost synergies of large-scale solar and offering customers an alternative to rooftop installations. Our Clean Energy Blueprint serves as our road map towards a cleaner energy future. This blueprint encompasses not only generation, but emphasizes the importance of an efficient, reliable and resilient energy grid. John mentioned our focus on resiliency by undergrounding our distribution system. Undergrounding distribution lines allows us to reduce the resources needed to trim trees, improves reliability and reduces the cost of customer inconvenience associated with storm response. Through our innovative solutions and strategic investments, we continuously strive to deliver sustainable energy options without compromising customer satisfaction. An example of this is our investment in the Neenah and Sheboygan Falls gas plants, where our advanced gas path upgrades will increase the efficiency, capacity and reliability of these units. Finally, in Iowa, I am pleased to report we reached a settlement with the Office of Consumer Advocate regarding our Iowa ratemaking principles docket. Settlement details are provided on Slide 5. The hearing on the advanced ratemaking principles for these projects was completed earlier this week. We requested an expedited decision from the Iowa Utilities Board so that we can start construction on these cost-effective investments for our Iowa customers. These investments will create jobs in Iowa during construction, support reliability of electric service in our Iowa service territory, bring shared revenues to our local communities and lease payments to rural landowners, all of which aligns with our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. I will now pass the mic to Robert, who will share our financial results and provide additional detail on our regulatory progress. Robert?Robert J. DurianThanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share. The primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter EPS variances were higher earnings resulting from capital investments, including our solar expansion program; and lower WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries compared to the second quarter of 2022. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales when compared to second quarter of 2022 and higher interest expense due to additional financings to fund capital investments. For the full year, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $2.82 to $2.96 per share. The midpoint of that range is a 6% increase over 2022 adjusted earnings per share. Details on our second quarter earnings drivers and 2023 full year earnings guidance can be found on Slide 6. To assist you in modeling our quarterly earnings this year, I wanted to quantify and provide some additional context to the timing of income tax expense. Income tax expenses recorded each quarter based on an estimated annual effective tax rate and the proportion of full year earnings generated each quarter. This causes fluctuations in the amount of tax expenses quarter-over-quarter, but it will not have an impact on full year earnings. As we continue to increase our renewable portfolio and generate higher levels of renewable tax benefits, these quarter-over-quarter variances have increased. We have provided our quarterly EPS estimates related to the tax benefit recognition timing for 2023 and 2022 on Slide 7. We have already executed a substantial portion of our 2023 financing plan to fund our investments in renewable projects, to mitigate rising interest rates, and to support retiring a $400 million debt maturity, which occurred in June. In addition to several successful debt issuances in the first quarter, we have raised approximately 1/3 of the up to $250 million of new common equity issuances we expect to execute in 2023 through an ATM program and share a direct plan. Our overall financing plans for 2023 have remained unchanged, and our remaining debt financing includes up to $300 million of long-term debt at IPL in the second half of the year. Earlier this year, we also closed on the sales of 125 megawatts of our West Riverside natural gas facility, providing proceeds, which will help reduce our external financing requirements. The sales of these partial interests in West Riverside were anticipated in our plans and provided combined proceeds of approximately $120 million. The progress we have made in our generation transformation positions us well to take advantage of the enhanced tax benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act that will positively impact our cost profile. With our strong focus on cost competitive rates for customers, we are working to optimize the tax benefits available under the IRA and continue to make progress with the planned transfers of our renewable tax credits as we have seen strong counterparty interests for these credits. As a reminder, the proceeds from these tax credit transfers will be used to help lower customer costs on our renewable and battery investments, enhance our cash flows thereby reducing some of our future financing needs and improving our credit metrics. Shifting to regulatory. We have included our notable regulatory initiatives for 2023 on Slide 9. Lisa covered our progress with some key regulatory proceedings related to our planned customer-focused investments. In addition, we are also making progress with several other key regulatory proceedings in Iowa and Wisconsin. Starting in Wisconsin, the rate review for test years 2024 and 2025 includes request for recovery of several investments that support sustainability, reliability and resiliency while keeping customer value and competitive rates top of mind. This proceeding is progressing as planned with the next steps in the rate review process involving continued discovery and audit by the PSCW staff and intervenors to support their testimony scheduled to be filed by September 5, followed by a hearing on September 27, and a final decision expected from the PSCW later this year. We have provided the procedural schedule for WPL's rate review on Slide 9. Additionally, in Wisconsin, WPL submitted its 2022 fuel reconciliation filing, which requested future recovery of $117 million of additional fuel costs incurred by WPL in 2022 to serve its customers. WPL currently anticipates a decision on the amount of recovery and the time frame for such recovery from the PSCW by the end of this quarter. While our utilities experienced higher fuel costs in 2022, driven by elevated commodity prices. During the first 6 months of 2023, we have experienced significant reductions in natural gas prices and strong performance of our generation facilities, which will help lower future fuel costs for our Wisconsin customers. And in Iowa, we have already started passing these lower fuel cost benefits onto our customers through the monthly fuel cost tariff in 2023. Continuing with our Iowa jurisdiction in anticipation of completing construction of several key investments for Iowa customers before the end of 2024, we filed notice with the Iowa Utilities Board this week, that we will be requesting an IPL electric and gas rate review later this year. Our last Iowa rate review included a forward test year in 2020. And since that time, we have made significant progress in transitioning the Iowa grid, rebuilding from a devastating (inaudible) storm and advancing IPL's transition to cleaner sources of generation, all while managing inflation and interest rate increases not anticipated in the last proceeding. The installation of the planned solar projects and the existing wind facilities in Iowa reduces IPL's fuel costs and provides enhanced tax credit benefits enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act. The retirement of the Lansing coal plant earlier this year is also a notable component of our generation transformation and will allow IPL's customers to avoid significant capital costs associated with continuing to operate the unit while reducing emissions and support the more distributed and changing resource mix. We appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials available on our website. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America.Dariusz LoznyThis is Dariusz on for Julien. Maybe just starting off in Iowa. I took a look at the proposed settlements -- partial settlement that you filed in your advanced ratemaking process earlier in the week. I was just wondering if you could maybe discuss some of the puts and takes that went into formulating that settlement with -- I believe it was a 10.75% ROE, but then not including the proposed battery storage. Also, any takeaways from the hearing that took place earlier in the week? And also importantly, where you see the process moving from here and over what time frame?John O. LarsenGreat. Dariusz, this is John. So we're very pleased with the progress on this docket and the hearing went as expected. I think as you're aware, we also reached settlement with the Office of Consumer Advocate. So we are going to be awaiting the IUB's decision. But maybe I'll ask Robert to share a few of those items a little more color on the puts and takes as you noted, Dariusz.Robert J. DurianDariusz, yes, I'd say it was a very balanced settlement between shareowner interest and customer interest as you kind of explained some of the details there. We do think it warrants to have a premium ROE at 10.75% to incentivize us to put renewables in the state, and that's the nature of the law that we have in Iowa. We also appreciated the willingness to agree on a cost target that was reasonable in light of what we've seen as far as cost for similar solar projects in our area. I'd say the one thing on the customer side that the intervening parties were interested in is a consumer protection plan, which is something newer for us. But we are confident in our ability to execute and operate the facilities to be able to achieve that. So all in all, I think it was a pretty balanced set of agreements of principles and I look forward to the Iowa Utility Board make a decision on this docket. It will probably be, I would guess, some time within maybe the next couple of months, we might see a decision.Dariusz LoznyGreat. If I could ask one more and this is more on the quarter/trends that you're seeing year-to-date. Certainly noted that it was maybe a bit of a softer quarter from a weather temperature standpoint. Can you just comment on the growth that you're seeing on a normalized basis across the 3 main customer classes?John O. LarsenYes. Dariusz, it's John again. Similar to last year, we've seen some really solid temperature normalized retail sales in the first half. So we had a pretty solid 2022. And very much on par with that this year. We also see some strong growth in the first half of '23. We've seen about 85 megawatts of new announced growth. So some nice strength there. I think I've mentioned before, we like to see a long-term trend before we call it a trend, but it continues to have some nice economic development and weather-normalized sales growth. Robert or Lisa, if you want to add anything. But I appreciate the question, Dariusz.Robert J. DurianYes. Maybe the only thing I'd add is, as John indicated, it was slightly better than expected as far as the temperature normalized growth. It was really on our residential side where we saw most of that really good meter growth for both electric and gas this quarter. So that was the primary driver.OperatorYour next question will come from Alex Mortimer at Mizuho Securities.Alexander MortimerAs you've examined your cost management throughout this year and planned out your own cuts for the later half of the year, have you discovered any savings you may be able to continue into the future? Maybe phrase another way, what portion should we think of as more onetime in nature versus ongoing run rate?Robert J. DurianYes, Alex, I would say a majority of what we're seeing as far as the difference between 2022 levels and 2023 are primarily because of some additional spend that we incurred in the second half of 2022. We continue to focus on O&amp;M controls and continue to make progress with different activities to try and reduce costs for our customers. A lot of some of the more exciting things that we're focused on right now is in the technology area, identifying different opportunities for us to use. Things to spend the capital dollars to reduce what I'll call longer-term O&amp;M costs. Things like undergrounding, which has been very effective at us being able to reduce storm costs this year. We've also implemented quite a bit of fiber throughout our service territory, which is helping reduce telecommunication costs. And we've got a pretty exciting new system we're going to put in to help us with enterprise workforce and asset management that we think will gain some efficiencies with a lot of our field operations. So -- we also have what I'd call more of a step change with this recent quarter because we retired the Lansing facility, one of our coal plants, which you'll see a reduction on. As I look to the future, probably some exciting things in the artificial intelligence area, but we're still in what I characterize as the evaluation phase there. And so we'll continue to monitor that and provide updates for the investors once we see more progress in that area.Lisa M. BartonAlex, the one thing that I would add to what Robert talked about is the fact that we are focused on affordability. We understand that that's going to be a driver of growth in the future. So from a cultural standpoint, the entire organization is really focused on evaluating our processes, our cost structure to make sure that we're delivering as best we can for our customers and communities.Alexander MortimerOkay. Understood. And then on more of a big picture level, we've seen a move to promote gas bands even in cold weather states like Massachusetts. How do you think about the long-term outlook for gas utilities and your gas infrastructure?John O. LarsenYes. Alex, I think we're still at a point where it's going to be very important, particularly in the region and climate that we have for gas to play a major role, certainly understand there's going to be lot of discussion about the role of natural gas, where it plays on either producing for generation or for home heating. But for at least the immediate future and for a while past that, we see natural gas playing a very important role.Lisa M. BartonAnd the only thing I would add is our -- the one thing I would add is our renewables portfolio really protects our customers from fuel cost volatility. The fact that 40% of our retail customers were served by renewable resources is a big differentiator, I think, for us.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your next question will come from James Kennedy at Guggenheim.James KennedyJust a quick one. I'm sorry if I missed this. But what will you be in a position to provide in terms of guidance with the next update if the Wisconsin case is still outstanding?Robert J. DurianYes, James, this is Robert. So if you think forward to the third quarter conference call in early November in the EEI Finance Conference that will be shortly after that. We will be providing updated capital expenditure and rate base projections for 2023 through 2027. And expect to have additional insights on expectations of our rate reviews in Iowa and Wisconsin to provide us more specifics on what we'll see for earnings guidance and financing plans in 2024.James KennedyOkay. But the formal guidance might have to wait?Robert J. DurianTo be determined. Like I said, we're expecting to make good progress with both of those proceedings in Wisconsin and Iowa and hopefully have more details or specifics regarding exactly what we'll show for earnings guidance in '24 and financing plans for '24. We're still very confident with the 5% to 7% long-term growth plan for EPS. So you shouldn't expect anything. But we'll just provide some more specifics hopefully, once we get further through these rate reviews.James KennedyOkay. Cool. And then on the settlement, the battery wasn't included. So I guess, just pathways forward there. Any color you can provide?John O. LarsenYes. Maybe, James, I'll just note that battery storage is very cost-effective solution and quite frankly, important part of our resource plan for our customers. So we fully expect to advance energy storage, but there are some options on kind of the regulatory, recovery and proceeding going forward. So a little more to be played out as the RPU proceeding advances. So I think we'll have more updates as we get to the Q3 call or EEI on the energy storage.OperatorAs there are no other questions, I will turn the conference back to Susan Gille for any closing remarks.Susan Trapp GilleThis concludes Alliant Energy's second quarter earnings call.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len? Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered strong results across the organization in the second quarter of 2023, while continuing to make progress toward our long-term objective of growing the business while simultaneously diversifying its revenue and earning streams. Total revenues increased by 11% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo net product sales, which grew by 39% and 49% respectively. Non-EYLEA revenue contributions were 41% of total revenues, the highest proportion for any quarter in the last 10 years excluding those with COVID antibody revenue contributions. Overall, we were pleased with the trajectory of the business and believe the company continues to be well-positioned to deliver long-term growth. In a few minutes George, Marion, and Bob will provide commentary on pipeline developments, commercial execution, and financial results that we achieved during the second quarter. For the remainder of my remarks today, I will focus on aflibercept 8 milligrams. We are very excited about the emerging clinical profile including the compelling two-year data from the pivotal PHOTON study in patients with diabetic macular edema which George will discuss in more detail. Now I will summarize the progress that has been made toward getting this important product candidate approved by the FDA. As we announced in late June, the Complete Response Letter or CRL that we received from the FDA regarding our Biologics License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, DME, and diabetic retinopathy did not identify any issues related to aflibercept 8 milligrams clinical efficacy, safety profile, trial design, labelling or drug substance manufacturing nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data. The CRL was entirely based on unresolved observations, resulting from the May 2023 FDA pre-approval inspection of a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Catalent, that Regeneron engaged to complete vial-filling for aflibercept 8 milligrams. The inspection observations were noted in a Form 483 and related to a manufacturing line in Catalent's facility that is used to fill vials with aflibercept 8 milligrams, as well as our C5 antibody pozelimab for the ultra-rare CHAPLE disease, which has a PDUFA date of August 20th. The inspection was conducted as part of the FDA review process for both the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA and the pozelimab BLA. Broadly speaking, the observation cited production and process control procedures, equipment validation, and facility maintenance. We, Catalent, and the FDA have had multiple discussions since the aflibercept 8 milligrams CRL. There is a clear understanding of the remediation work that is required to allow the FDA to assume approving BLAs that involve manufacturing on this line. Catalent has already provided data and information to the FDA that could satisfy some of these requirements and expects to be able to provide the remaining required data and information by mid-August. The FDA said they will strive to complete their review expeditiously prior to the August 20th PDUFA date for pozelimab. However, if they are unable to complete their review before this date, the FDA said that they may need to extend their review by up to three months. If they do extend the review, FDA has stated that they will continue to prioritize the review and complete it as early as possible. Importantly, the FDA has also stated that their review of the Catalent manufacturing data in the context of the pozelimab BLA will support actions for both the pozelimab BLA and the aflibercept 8 milligrams BLA resubmission, which has already been submitted. In summary, we and Catalent expect to submit by mid-August all of the Catalent manufacturing data and information required to address the observations resulting from the pre-approval inspection. The FDA has stated that they will strive to complete their review expeditiously, prior to August 20th. If not, we anticipate the FDA will act on pozelimab and aflibercept 8 milligram BLAs before the end of the third quarter. In closing, we remain confident in our strategy of focusing investments on our internal R&amp;D capabilities while exploring potential external collaborations as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to George. George Yancopoulos: Thank you, Len. I would like to start with our recent update on aflibercept 8 milligram data in DME that Len referred to. At the Annual American Society of Retina Specialists meeting, we presented the two-year results from our PHOTON study. These data demonstrated that the vast majority of aflibercept 8 milligram patients were randomized to the 12-week and 16-week dosing intervals continued to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 89% of all aflibercept 8 milligram patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire two-year period, while 84% of patients assigned to every 16-week dosing at baseline, were able to maintain that interval or extend beyond it. On that point, many patients met the criteria for extension to longer intervals, with 44% meeting the criteria for greater than 20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who were eligible for 24-week dosing intervals. The safety profile of aflibercept 8 milligram remained consistent with EYLEA. Sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years is unprecedented in the field. Our results further strengthen the clinical profile of aflibercept 8 milligram and position this investigational medicine to become the future standard of care retinal diseases. Later in the third quarter, we and Bayer are planning to share initial results from the second year analysis of the PULSAR study in patients with wet AMD. Moving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline on Dupixent. We look forward to the FDA decision for our sBLA in chronic spontaneous urticaria by October 22nd, 2023, in terms of Dupixent in patients with COPD. We and Sanofi are pleased to announce that Dupixent was granted breakthrough designation for uncontrolled COPD with an eosiniphilic phenotype based on the positive results of the Phase 3 BOREAS study. Based on ongoing discussions with the FDA, we expect that in addition to the BOREAS study results, we will need to provide data from the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study to support a BLA and such data requirements remain under discussion with the FDA. We continue to expect final results for the NOTUS study by mid-2024. Moving to Itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated for COPD in former smokers. In May, Sanofi announced that the Phase 3 AERIFY-1 and 2 studies had passed an interim futility analysis. These studies remain on track for readout and regulatory submissions in 2025. Both the Itepekimab and Dupixent could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by levering their distinct mechanism of action in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD. Moving to oncology and combinations with Libtayo. In June, in an oral presentation at the ASCO conference, we presented data for the combination of fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo, which showed consistent response rates ranging from 56% to 63% across three independent cohorts of advanced melanoma patients, including a new cohort of patients who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant melanoma setting. These response rates represent about double the rate historically seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy in similar settings and clinically meaningful responses were observed in Post Hoc analysis of various populations of interest, including patients with poor prognosis factors and varying tumor PD-L1 expression levels. The safety profile of fianlimab and Libtayo combination in these cohorts appears to be generally consistent with the safety profile of Libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, except for the higher rates of adrenal insufficiency, which were Grade 2 or lower in the majority of cases, with all cases successfully managed with steroid replacement. Our fianlimab plus Libtayo Phase 3 studies in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma are enrolling patients as are the Phase 2 portions of the Phase 2/3 studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Next on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. Later this year, we are planning to share initial clinical data for the combination of ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD28 bispecific plus Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. Last year we showed encouraging ubamatamab monotherapy data in advanced ovarian cancer and we believe that combining it with Libtayo may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity. Moving to costimulatory bispecifics. We are currently exploring multiple different CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings, in combination with Libtayo well with corresponding CD3 bispecifics in our Phase 1 study of REGN5678, our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecifics in advanced prostate cancer in combination with Libtayo, which has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity. The safety profile of this combination continues to pose a challenge, highlighted by the recently observed second Grade 5 adverse event or death. Although serious immune-mediated adverse events continued to be highly correlated to patients who experience profound responses, we have decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients with the full dose Libtayo combination and explore PSMAxCD28 combination with lower doses of Libtayo. We also will continue to explore PSMAxCD28 as a monotherapy, where we have seen anti-tumor activity in some patients and we will explore PSMAxCD28 in combination with other immunotherapy modalities. We believe our prostate cancer data support the exciting potential of costimulatory bispecifics both the challenge of focusing the response solely to the tumor. Our preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest the degree of immune-related adverse events seen when combining costims with PD1 blockade may depend on the particular costim target and tumor types. Moreover, combining costims with CD3 bispecifics may not result in these types of severe immune-mediated adverse events. Along these lines, our other costimulatory bispecific programs continue, including our MUC16xCD28 costim with Libtayo and MUC16xCD28 costim with ubamatamab both in ovarian cancer as well as our EGFRxCD28 costim with Libtayo in colorectal and other cancers. In these early dose-escalation studies, we have observed limited immune-mediated toxicities to-date. We are also excited about combining our costimulatory bispecifics with our CD3 bispecifics in our hem/onc programs, which continue to progress. We have initiated dosing of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecifics with odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope can improve on the impressive efficacy demonstrated by odronextamab alone in that setting. In terms of odronextamab monotherapy, US and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma remain on track. Regarding linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we recently presented updated data at the ASCO Annual Meeting demonstrating early deep and durable responses in patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma, with 71% objective response rate and 59% of patients achieving a very good partial response or better at the recommended 200-milligram dose with a median follow-up of only six months, with the data potentially improving as they mature. We believe these data support linvoseltamab's best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety, hospital requirements, and favorable dosing schedule. In the fourth quarter this year, we are planning to present additional data with longer follow up and to submit regulatory applications for linvoseltamab. We also plan to start combination studies with myeloma-specific costim next year. Next to genetic medicines. In the second quarter, we and Alnylam jointly announced the first human data suggesting that a siRNA can be used to silence pathological genes in the brain, which may open up an entirely new approach to fighting back against neurodegenerative and other central nervous system diseases. We plan to initiate additional clinical programs for CNS diseases next year. As announced by our collaboration with Intellia, we plan to initiate the first in-vivo CRISPR-based Phase 3 clinical program by year-end, subject to regulatory feedback in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy. And in terms of our targeted gene delivery pipeline, we hope to initiate our first clinical program in 2024 for Hemophilia B. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&amp;D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early-stage opportunities and we are looking forward to several important clinical milestones in the second half of this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Marion. Marion McCourt: Thank you, George. In the second quarter, Regeneron delivered impressive results across our commercial portfolio, notably Regeneron medicines currently lead multiple disease categories and our future is promising with short and longer-term scientific innovations on the horizon. As Len mentioned, we eagerly await the anticipated approval of aflibercept 8 milligram for retinal diseases, beyond that our robust late-stage pipeline supports additional commercial opportunities that we anticipate will continue to drive growth. Starting with EYLEA, the anti-VEGF category leader in retinal diseases. US EYLEA net sales were $1.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. EYLEA total category share remained stable at 46% over the last two quarters and at approximately 70% for branded share. At the end of the second quarter, there was minimal sequential change in wholesaler inventory levels compared to the levels at the end of the first quarter. Our strategic focus is to maintain and grow Regeneron's anti-VEGF leadership and we're well-positioned to deliver on the score in an increasingly competitive category. Last week at ASRS, we presented our two-year data in diabetic macular edema which further confirmed the unprecedented durability of aflibercept 8 milligrams, with 44% of patients assigned intervals of at least 20 weeks at the end of their second year. Market enthusiasm remains high for this important innovation and our commercial team is ready and excited to launch aflibercept 8 milligram upon approval. Moving now to Libtayo. Global net sales were $210 million, up 49% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In the US, net sales were $130 million, up 43% driven by steady growth in non-melanoma skin cancer and strong growth in lung cancer. In lung cancer, Libtayo use in new patients share is accelerating, both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy with an expanding base of prescribers in the community and academic settings. Outside the US Libtayo, net sales were at $80 million, a 58% increase on a constant-currency basis. Growth was driven by demand in the non-melanoma skin cancer indications and initial launches in lung cancer. We expect to drive accelerated performance as we build Regeneron's presence in key international markets and secure access and reimbursement for lung cancer indications. And lastly to Dupixent, which continues to revolutionize the lives of patients with type 2 diseases. Global net sales were approximately $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023. In the US, net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $2.1 billion driven by growth across all indications and age groups. Once again, Dupixent is the number one prescribed biologic medicine for new-to-brand patients across all approved indications and is the category leader in total prescriptions in four out of five indications. We see impressive uptake across our recent US launches with significant opportunity for future growth. In eosinophilic esophagitis, well over 15,000 patients have been initiated since launch and we are actively investing in disease awareness initiatives to empower patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for this debilitating disease. Our prurigo nodularis launch is off to a fast start with physicians rapidly recognizing Dupixent as the go-to treatment for this often underdiagnosed dermatologic condition. Additionally, we look forward to our October 22nd PDUFA date in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where we estimate Dupixent could benefit up to 300,000 US patients. We also continue to generate impressive growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps, Dupixent's three largest indications. There is robust demand among all indicated age groups with a significant opportunity for future growth beyond the hundreds of thousands of patients around the world, whose lives have already been transformed by Dupixent. In summary, we delivered a strong commercial performance in the second quarter with Regeneron's medicines positioned for sustained growth. We continue to demonstrate industry-leading execution across our current portfolio and we are prepared to maximize opportunities from our robust pipeline, with the goal of extending Regeneron's scientific innovations to even more patients. Now I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron's second quarter results demonstrate continued growth and strong financial performance across the organization. Second quarter 2023 total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, driven by strong Dupixent sales growth coupled with improving profitability within our Sanofi collaboration and continued momentum from Libtayo. Second quarter diluted net income per share was $10.24 on net income of $1.2 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2023 ex-US EYLEA net product sales were $886 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the US. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $944 million in the second quarter and grew 39% versus the prior year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $751 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter of 2022, reflecting higher volumes and an improving margin profile for Dupixent. We expect further margin expansion from the collaboration driven by continued Dupixent global sales growth coupled with higher gross margins due to significant drug substance yield improvements resulting from dupilumab manufacturing process enhancements. These factors are also contributing to a gradual increase in the rate in which we are repaying the antibody development balance to Sanofi. Once this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Recall that a portion of our Sanofi collaboration revenue was related to the manufacturing of commercial supplies, for which we are reimbursed by Sanofi. As we continue to face in the higher yield manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect these second half reimbursements to be approximately 25% lower than the first half of 2023, with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Other revenues were $69 million in the second quarter, up 17% versus the prior year. We continue to expect other revenue to be higher in the second half of 2023 as compared to the first half. Recall that other revenue primarily includes reimbursements for the manufacturing of certain Regeneron discovered products commercialized by other companies, including ex-US Praluent, ARCALYST, and ZALTRAP, as well as royalties for Alaris and our share of global profits for ARCALYST. Moving now to our operating expenses. Second quarter 2023 R&amp;D expense was $974 million, representing continued investment in our robust pipeline. Year-over-year R&amp;D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's pipeline which encompasses approximately 20 late-stage or potentially registrational studies including our ongoing aflibercept 8 mg studies. Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of therapy for our hem/onc product candidates and our advancing fianlimab development program. The increase in R&amp;D expense was also driven in part by the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreements and increased manufacturing activity associated with the company's earlier-stage product candidates. SG&amp;A was $562 million in the second quarter, reflecting the ongoing build-out of our ex-US operations following the acquisition of global rights to Libtayo last year, higher headcount and related costs, and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Second quarter 2023 COCM was $213 million up 44% versus the prior year driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher Dupixent volumes. As we progress the phasing of the improved manufacturing process for Dupixent, we expect COCM in the second half of this year to decline versus the first half as our unchanged 2023 COCM guidance reflects with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $12.6 billion. We continue to opportunistically deploy cash towards share repurchases throughout the second quarter, buying back $723 million of our shares. At current levels, we remain buyers of our shares, and as of June 30th, approximately $2.3 billion remained available for repurchases under our existing authorization. Finally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 guidance ranges based on our first half results and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year. We have tightened guidance ranges for 2023 SG&amp;A and R&amp;D spend and provided updated guidance ranges for our effective tax rate. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, Regeneron delivered positive financial results in the second quarter of 2023 and we remain excited for the potential upcoming launch of aflibercept 8 mg in the third quarter. With that I will now pass the call back to Ryan. Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks, we will now open the call for Q&amp;A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please? See also 15 Most Consumed Meats in the World and 12 Best Eastern European Countries to Meet Women.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is now open. Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions and on all the updates today. So on the 8 milligrams CRL, do you have any idea if it's a Class 1 or Class 2 resubmission? And you say that FDA is going to take action in the third quarter or could take action. What does that mean? Are they going to provide an approval decision or is that just going to be acceptance of a refiling? Thank you. Leonard Schleifer: Hi, Evan. It's Len. Thanks for your question. So just to clarify, the FDA has not classified the resubmission as Class 1 or Class 2 because they have said that the timeline for pozelimab will be governing what happens with our 8 milligrams. So let me remind you what happened, it was a pre-approval inspection for both products. The pozelimab is for our ultra-rare disease -- CHAPLE disease and it has a PDUFA date of the 20th. What the FDA has said is that they will review the remediation efforts in the context of the pozelimab BLA and therefore, whatever happens there will govern the timeline and results. And when we say we expect them to take action, we mean, we expect them to make an approval or not decision. If they find the manufacturing remediation acceptable for the pozelimab, then we think they will be in a position to promptly make a decision on approval for the 8 milligrams. Does that answer your question? Ryan Crowe: He is off the line. We will move to the next question Shannon. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Tyler Van Buren: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So the timeline to the FDA potentially taking action by the end of this quarter and high-dose EYLEA is very encouraging and investors are clearly surprised by the short lines. So kudos to you all for executing. But as we think about the data submission in a couple of weeks, what additional detail can you provide regarding the manufacturing data and other information that are required from Catalent? And how feasible it is to review this in a few days prior to the pozelimab decision date on August 20th? Leonard Schleifer: Right. Great question. So we've been in very close contact with Catalent and the FDA, multiple meetings, oral, written, and so forth, and we have a clear understanding of what's required from an information point of view and from a data point of view. The submissions have been on a rolling basis that as Catalent has completed work, they've submitted data and information already to the FDA. There is very little that will be left for the last submission at the middle of August, and that's why the FDA has told us and they know what's coming that they will strive to expeditiously review that. And if they can't get that done by the few days before the pozelimab PDUFA date, they have told us that they will prioritize our review and do that as soon as possible. That's why we have confidence about this getting done in this quarter. So to summarize the data has been coming in on a rolling basis. We have everything we need, the last piece of information that we'll be rolling in and submitted by the middle of the month, the FDA will strive expeditiously to review that in time for the August 20th PDUFA date. But if not, there will be a clock extension for up to three months, but they have told us that they will prioritize our review. And that's why we believe it will get done, if not in time for the pozelimab PDUFA date in the near future thereafter. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Len. Next question, please Shannon. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And really thank you very much for providing all the clarity on the filing situation right now. Maybe taking -- so just trying to understand this a little bit more. So is it fair to say you have already submitted everything for pozelimab and the remaining part is related to high-dose EYLEA only? Is that fair? Leonard Schleifer: Actually, the way you should think about it, we've submitted everything we need for pozelimab except for the final remediation of the pre-approval inspection, which applies both to pozelimab and to the 8 milligram EYLEA. So it's a single pre-approval inspection same data and information required for both. Once that is in then we will have completed everything necessary for pozelimab and for the EYLEA 8 milligrams. They are linked together. The FDA has clearly stated to us that the review of this remediation in the context of the pozelimab BLA will govern what happens to the 8-milligram remediation.George Yancopoulos: And I think there is nothing specific to either pozelimab or aflibercept about the data. This has to do as Len said with general manufacturing processes and operations at the Catalent manufacturing facility, particularly with this one manufacturing line. Leonard Schleifer: Hey, that's a very good point, George. So that's why the single pre-approval inspection applies to both products. It wasn't the product specifically, it was the processes and validation on the line that fills the two products. So one remediation satisfies both, all the data and information that is being submitted on a rolling basis, the last piece comes in, in the middle of August, the FDA is aware of this. They've told us in writing that they will strive to do that as expeditiously. If they get it done before the end of the PDUFA, an original PDUFA clock, that's great. If they don't, they'll consider an amendment that will set the clock back three months. But notwithstanding that three months, they've told us that they will continue to prioritize our review. So we're very pleased and we're working very hard. Catalent is working very hard, the FDA is working very hard, everybody wants this done properly and finished and properly remediated. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Next question please, Shannon. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Tim Anderson: Thank you very much. I have a question on the Vabysmo. So Roche at Q3 said they're capturing 30% of treatment-naive patients which seems like a quite high figure frankly. And then they said afterward, that it's not the extended dosing that's driving this as much as it is the better drawing that they say docs or seeing with their product. I'm wondering how those comments kind of line up with what you're seeing play out in the US market. Thank you. Marion McCourt: Sure. So, Tom, I will comment on our EYLEA performance. And as I just shared with you the performance in the quarter was strong, certainly we see EYLEA steadily as the standard-of-care in the anti-VEGF category. We continue to capture not only naïve-patients, but also another big source of business is switch patients from Avastin. Obviously, the other branded competitors are smaller in market today. But I would say that beyond your comment, probably best to get more clarification from the individuals who are commercializing faricimab in the market. But certainly, I do want you to know that we are seeing continued strength in EYLEA performance and obviously very much look forward to having the potentially game-changing opportunity of bringing aflibercept 8 milligrams into the marketplace and where the profile of efficacy, safety and durability has so many KOLs and prescribers excited based on what they've seen recently in the clinical data presented at ASRS. Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Marion. Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Chris Raymond: Thanks. Just maybe another market-related question. So I know these extended dose therapies have benefits in and of themselves on the face of them. But there's been some decent level of market chatter around docs, looking to free up injection capacity specifically to make room for geographic atrophy patients and specifically with the Apellis drug. Just maybe curious how widespread was that notion before the Syfovre safety issue. And now with the issue have you noticed a discernible shift among docs who we're talking about that? And then maybe a related question, you guys have talked I think about an early effort of your own in geographic atrophy. Clearly, the market is sizable, when could we expect to hear more about that effort? Marion McCourt: So let me share first in terms of the market dynamic. I think the most exciting thing and most important thing about aflibercept 8 milligram is it gives prescribers for all of their patients whether a naïve-patient, a patient currently on EYLEA or a patient on another anti-VEGF category product, the opportunity to decide if that patient is a candidate when we launch and when we have an FDA approval, is the patient is a candidate for aflibercept 8 milligram, that does have benefit to the patient and prescriber and potentially to the office capacity and patient flow. I think it's premature to comment on the category that we're not directly involved in. We are though very focused on making sure that we are ready for launch and certainly at the proper time, educating all stakeholders on aflibercept 8 milligram once we have an approval. George Yancopoulos: And in terms of our own efforts, as I'm sure many are aware we've been very active with what we feel are very innovative approaches in the complement blockade field. And we believe that we may have an approach that may allow potential treatment in these retinal diseases. While avoiding some of the very concerning adverse events having to do with issues like inclusive vasculitis and so forth, and you'll be hearing much more about those efforts in the short-term. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Marion and George. Shannon, please move to the next question. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.Carter Gould: Great, good morning. And thanks for all the transparency. Maybe switching gears a bit, in terms of the update on your costim and report of the death and the change in the dosing paradigm with 5678 in combination with Libtayo. George maybe you can speak about the implications for other combination efforts of CD28 with Libtayo, it's going to require lower dosing with those efforts with Libtayo portion and just the broader implications there and just fill your level of confidence you can kind of thread that needle in terms of the dosing levels? Thank you. George Yancopoulos: Great question. Obviously, as you know, in cancer, the biggest hurdle is actually coming up with approaches and new classes of agents that have the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm to really bring new ability to address cancers that have previously been untreatable or refractory to treatment. So I think that, that excitement continues with the costim platform in terms of all of the signs and the preclinical modeling and predictions have really delivered in terms of showing that this new class does seemingly has the ability to really change the efficacy paradigm. But now we have to balance that as you said with the safety, because with more efficacy, which is often seen in the cancer field comes more safety concerns to what you just said, what we've seen preclinically and we're now beginning to see it in the clinic that the amount of associated immune adverse events is related to the particular costim target. So what you see for one costim doesn't necessarily apply to the other costim. So we are, as you said for our PSMA costim moving out of lower doses of the Libtayo because the full dose combination, while it seems like it has the potential to be very efficacious, but also has in some cases these associated only, remember only in the patients who are having deep responses, these associated in some cases, it can be very serious even resulting in death associated immune adverse events. So we're moving away from full dose combinations there and we're going and hoping that we can maintain some level of the efficacy, but avoiding these very serious immune-related adverse events. We're not doing that yet, because we're not seeing these sort of immune-related adverse events with our other costims. And the other very, very important thing just to remind you from our preclinical modeling, these types of immune-related adverse events that we're seeing with the PSMA in combination costim in combination with Libtayo are not seeing preclinically when you combine with the CD3 bispecific. And so we are very aggressively trying to move forward those programs as well, where we hope we may have a better efficacy, safety profile. So it's both a -- very exciting time to have these very active molecules, remember or remind you, we have three classes now, three independent classes of very active molecules that have been individually validated in our portfolio. We have the checkpoint inhibitors, in particular, our PD1 and our LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitors, which are validated. We have our CD3 bispecifics which are validated and we now have our costims which are validated from the efficacy perspective, very exciting time to be mixing and matching them. The challenge is to mix-and-match them appropriately to maximize the signal-to-noise, the therapeutic benefits relative to the potential adverse events we see in the patients. Ryan Crowe: Thanks, George. Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Salveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and nice updates this morning. Clearly the possibility of a permanent J-code now has moved to April and it shortens the runway for patients switching from EYLEA ahead of potentially loss of exclusivity in May. So kind of a two-part question here. What are the dynamics around this and how do you, on one hand kind of maintain and grow the switch population from EYLEA? But secondly, how should we think about the uptake of high-dose EYLEA without a permanent J-code? Thank you. Marion McCourt: Hi Salveen. So I'll get started. Certainly, we're conscious of the dates and the requirement for submissions to CMS that occur at the start of a quarter. So we would estimate potentially the time frame that you're referencing, if we have an approval in the third quarter. What I would share is that we anticipate use of aflibercept 8 milligram after approval and launch before we have the permanent J-code. Retina specialists are sophisticated in their reimbursement capabilities at the office level. They are experienced with newer products coming into the marketplace on a fairly regular basis and how to make certain that they validate reimbursement for products prior to having the permanent J-code under a temporary J-code. So obviously, we want to have the permanent J-code that will be a positive. But certainly, we do see the opportunity for uptake across patient types prior to that situation with CMS. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Marion. Shannon, please move to the next question. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Len, I know we've talked about this before, but the company has been somewhat non-traditional on pricing decisions historically. You guys priced EYLEA at a discount to Lucentis. You worked with ICER on Dupixent pricing. So just wondering why we shouldn't expect it similar approach here with high-dose EYLEA. Thank you. Leonard Schleifer: Thanks, Terrence. If your comments referencing similar, I mean, thoughtful and appropriate, we would agree. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Next question please Shannon. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.Brian Abrahams: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress and appreciate all the details. Maybe just another clarification on 8 milligram aflibercept. Can you characterize your level of confidence that a re-inspection would not be required? Have you had any interactions or feedback with the agency around this? And is there a defined period of time where the FDA would need to wait re-inspection or not to ensure that the remediations are sustainable before proving to BLAs? Thanks. Leonard Schleifer: Great. Thanks for your question. Look, we've tried to be 1,000% transparent as usual Regeneron. And this is really, let me just see if I can summarize it, again, what we know. We've been in close contact with the FDA as has Catalent. We know what the remediations required are and we've been submitting them on a rolling basis. We expect to submit the last requirement by the middle of August and that will be several days before the PDUFA date for the pozelimab BLA. The FDA has been very clear that they will strive to expeditiously review that. If they can, great. They can't, they said there would be a three-month clock extension. But even with a three-month clock extension, they've been very categorical in saying that they would prioritize our review and try and get it done as soon as possible. Those facts are what led us to believe it would be done during the third quarter. In all of this, is the fact that there has been no need, no discussion, no indication whatsoever that a re-inspection would be necessary. The FDA of course is free to make those decisions, but we have not seen any indication of that in our very detailed and close contact. So we've given you our best estimate at this point. Ryan Crowe: Thanks, Len. Let's move to the next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Can you just come back to the CD28 PSMA update? Maybe just elaborate a little bit more in terms of the approach of lowering the PD-1 exposure to address the safety issues here and taking that approach versus trying to work to further adjust the dosing of the bispecific piece of the equation? Thanks so much. George Yancopoulos: Well, we should say that we are adjusting both doses. We have been already exploring a variety of doses from very low doses to the highest active doses on the costim side. But we've been doing all of them in the context of the full dose Libtayo. So now what we're doing is we're exploring some of the doses that are active, particularly ones are active as monotherapy, as I mentioned, there is monotherapy activity with the PSMA costim. And now we are -- to try to decrease these immune-related adverse events. Let me remind you, they are on the same sort of class of immune-related adverse events that you do see with checkpoint inhibitors in general. We're just seeing them in some patients, the one with the biggest responses in some cases to a greater extent. So we're hoping that lowering the checkpoint inhibition may allow us to adjust the therapeutic window there. But we are as you are saying dealing with a couple different doses of the costim, but now we're incorporating lower doses of the Libtayo into the program as well. Leonard Schleifer: I think what George said earlier, just maybe it bears repeating, is that he said that we're starting with the good position of having very impressive efficacy, one. And two side effects that for the most part in the patients who are benefiting with the efficacy, that's a very good position to begin to explore and how to get the therapeutic index or signal to noise as George calls it right. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Let's move to the next question, Shannon. Thank you. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Dane Leone: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Congratulations on the updates and best of luck with the resolution of the reviews for pozelimab and 8 mg aflibercept. I actually want to ask you to expand a bit on your discussions with the FDA and potential filing or early filing on Dupixent for COPD. The point I'd like a little bit more clarity on specifically what you may be able to have from NOTUS before the final readout of that study that you could potentially include in a package with the BOREAS results to get the FDA comfortable with an accelerated review for that indication. Thank you. George Yancopoulos: Yeah. What we know right now is that we're going to need data from NOTUS. And right now, as we said, we are still in discussions on what that data could be. And so right now, we don't have any details to give you. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George. Hopefully an update and next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Bristow: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the quarter and the progress. Just maybe one on the itepekimab interim. Can you share anything on the utility threshold? And if not, specifically, could you say how the sort of Fed relative to BOREAS? Thanks. Leonard Schleifer: I don't think we have anything specific. This was handled by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee sort of a standard approach. We're pleased that we passed it. And we will look forward to further data at the end of the study. Ryan Crowe: And both we and Sanofi are blinded to that. We only got the go-decision from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. So we will proceed to a final readout for both of those studies. Let's go to the next question, please.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird. Your line is now open. Luke Junk: Hey, this is Luke on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what drove the Libtayo growth this quarter? Was there any stocking or was it largely demand-based? Thanks. Marion McCourt: Thank you, Luke. And I'm pleased to share it is demand growth. Certainly, we see continued and steady performance across our skin indications both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. In addition to that, it is exciting that we are seeing not only an increase in the number of prescribers for our lung cancer indications, but the depth of prescribing is improving and increasing in both the community and also academic settings. But that is demand based, it is not stocking based. Ryan Crowe: And I think Shannon we have time for two more questions, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So my question is for George, on the costims, please. You mentioned that you haven't seen the immune age with respect to your other costim trials. Could you please comment on whether the dosing step-ups at this point are close to the higher dosing levels that you're stepping back from in the PSMA trial? I'm just trying to contextualize whether you really have advanced those other trials to the point to really know whether you're going to have similar problems in your other costim trials? Thanks very much. George Yancopoulos: That's a very good and fair question. And those programs are at earlier stages, so we won't know until we are more advanced, whether when we get to the same sort of efficacy type levels, do we have the same sort of immune-related adverse events associations or not. What I was referring to is in the preclinical studies, the amount of this associated T-Cell activation that can lead to these sorts of immune-related adverse events varies depending on the tumor class and on the costim itself. So based on that we would expect to see different ratios of immune-related adverse events. Those other programs though right now are all-in stages where they are in with full dose Libtayo combinations at this point. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, Shannon. We have time for one more question. Operator: Our last question is from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Akash Tewari: Hey, thanks so much. I'll switch it up. I guess maybe for your obesity program, you had data at the ADA showing synergy with your myostatin inhibition program when combined with the GLP-1. I guess the natural observation here is Regeneron doesn't currently have a program in development. Is there any interest in acquiring one externally via BD or partnership at this time? Thanks. George Yancopoulos: Well, what we would say is, we do think that obviously, there's a lot of focus on obesity and particularly these new agents that are causing a large amount of weight loss. But as you described is being increasingly recognized that the quality of this weight loss may prove challenging that many patients are actually losing muscle or lean body mass which is -- can be very detrimental particularly if they stay on these therapies or yoyo on and off them, that can really lead to substantial changes over-time and body composition can be very debilitating for patients. And as you said, we've had long investment in programs that can maintain muscle mass in various settings and we've shown that they can maintain or even grow muscle mass in the setting of these types of obesity treatments in our preclinical modeling. So obviously it is a very exciting opportunity to think about which is, can we combine some of our muscle preservation or growth strategies and biologics to prevent these concerning side effects that are being seen with the new class of profound weight loss agents. And so we are very actively pursuing everything that we can imagine. And hopefully, we'll be providing updates on our approaches as time goes along. Ryan Crowe: Okay. Thanks, George, and thanks for everyone who dialed in today and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team is available to answer any remaining questions. Thank you once again and have a great day. Operator: This concludes today's conference call.

However, with inflation easing, the retail sector is now a lot more confident about a solid back-to-school shopping season.The back-to-school sales are projected to grow year over year in 2023, which is definitely good news for the struggling retail sector. Although higher prices are going to play a part in elevating overall sales, demand too is high, which bodes well for retailers.Back-to-School Sales to JumpAccording to a survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF), 2023 will be the most expensive back-to-school shopping season. Overall sales are projected to surpass $135 billion, $24 billion more than in 2022.NRF projects that families with children in elementary through high school are likely to spend an average of $890.07, which is around $25 higher than the previous year and would set a new record.Similarly, families with college students are projected to shell out in record numbers, with the NRF estimating an average of $1,366.95 per person. This amount is more than $167 higher than the spending seen last year.The demand for electronics, particularly laptops and tablets, is expected to reach a record high, resulting in increased consumer spending in this category.The retail sector has been suffering over the past year. The Fed resumed its aggressive interest rate hike in July after pausing briefly in June. The central bank has increased interest rates by 525 points since March 2022, taking the federal funds rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, inflation at the same time has been steadily declining over the past year after peaking at a 40-year-high of 9.1% in June 2022. Although inflation declined to 4.1% in June, which is a lot higher than the Fed’s 2% target, market participants are optimistic that the central bank might soon end its current monetary tightening policy.Lower interest rates will thus help the retail sector, as this will give consumers more purchasing power.Story continuesStocks to BuyGiven this situation, it would be ideal to watch out for these four stocks.Crocs, Inc.
