When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, for US$25m worth of shares, at about US$80.10 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$55.00). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$7.9m for 135.84k shares. But insiders sold 1.72m shares worth US$130m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Charles Schwab Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Charles Schwab insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Overall, 10 insiders shelled out US$7.9m for shares in the company -- and none sold. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Charles Schwab insiders own 1.4% of the company, worth about US$1.4b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Charles Schwab Tell Us?The recent insider purchases are heartening. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The recent buying by some insiders , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Charles Schwab insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Nucor, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.32 = US$9.1b ÷ (US$32b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Nucor has an ROCE of 32%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor roceIn the above chart we have measured Nucor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Nucor. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 32%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 114%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Nucor thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.In Conclusion...All in all, it's terrific to see that Nucor is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 147% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesLike most companies, Nucor does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

2,a3c40ee6-1a02-3e47-9d75-801fc3cc6c20,CTAS,2023-06-12,Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 65% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-corporation-nasdaq-ctas-favoured-110043867.html,1686567643,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Cintas' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 17 shareholders own 50% of the company Insider ownership in Cintas is 15%If you want to know who really controls Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cintas. View our latest analysis for Cintas ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cintas?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Cintas does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cintas' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cintas. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Cintas' case, its Top Key Executive, Scott Farmer, is the largest shareholder, holding 14% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.8% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of CintasWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Cintas Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$7.3b stake in this US$49b business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cintas. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cintas better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Cintas , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:JWN) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 34% in the last month. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. In fact, the share price has declined rather badly, down some 61% in that time. Some might say the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop. Of course, this could be the start of a turnaround.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$363m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Nordstrom became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.The revenue decline of 1.4% isn't too bad. But if the market expected durable top line growth, then that could explain the share price weakness.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on NordstromWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Nordstrom, it has a TSR of -56% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 10% in the last year, Nordstrom shareholders lost 23% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Nordstrom  that you should be aware of.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

To provide multiple industries—including telecommunications, data centers, metrology, aviation and defense—with a long-term and precise timing and frequency solution, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces the 5071B cesium atomic clock that can perform autonomous time keeping for months in the event of GNSS denials.Microchip’s 5071B is the next-generation commercial cesium clock to the existing 5071A, which has been the primary contributor to international time for more than three decades. The 5071B is available in a three-unit height (3U) 19-inch rackmount enclosure, providing a compact product to work in environments where it can be easily transported and secured versus a larger alternative designed specifically for laboratory environments.The 5071B has upgraded electronic components to address possible obsolescence or non-RoHS circuitry. The product provides 100 ns holdover for more than two months, maintaining system synchronization when GNSS signals like GPS are denied. For example, this capability would enable a 5G network to remain fully operational for months without GNSS.“The 5071A has been the world’s premier time and frequency standard for decades. With the upgraded 5071B, Microchip continues its position as the industry leader in complex timing solutions,” said Randy Brudzinski, vice president, Microchip’s frequency and time systems business unit. “Our customers can rely on the 5071B’s technology for years to come and implement a timing and frequency solution with confidence in continuity of supply and modern components, which eliminates obsolescence concerns.”Story continuesAs a cesium beam tube product with no deterministic long-term frequency drift, the 5071B provides absolute frequency accuracy of 5E-13 or 500 quadrillionths over all specified environmental conditions for the life of the product. For military applications requiring rapid deployments for system radars, 5E-13 stability eliminates the need for the acquisition of external synchronization sources prior to radiating. In satellite communications, this enables the user to broadcast and transmit over very small frequency bands without drifting out of band for the entire duration of the product.When deployed, a product like the 5071B could maintain and better synchronize the critical communication between an aircraft and control tower. Air traffic control in the United States utilizes the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) to precisely locate the position of aircraft across the nation’s airspace. The stability of the 5071B enables more accurate locations and continued operation during GNSS outages.The 5071B is now fully compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), making this product available in regions where regulatory policies are in place.Microchip provides the broadest portfolio of clock and timing systems in the industry. Its state-of-the-art solutions are based on the company’s long heritage in the field of synchronization and timing and vertical integration of its core timing technologies.Development ToolsThe 5071B cesium atomic clock is supported by Clockstudio™ Software Tool to control and monitor data.Pricing and AvailabilityMicrochip’s 5071B cesium atomic clock is now available in a 3U 19-inch rackmount enclosure in two performance levels: 5071B-001 and 5071B-002.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Microchip Technology with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Microchip Technology's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Microchip Technology's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 51%. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Microchip Technology shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 28% to 37% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Microchip Technology?Are Microchip Technology Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Microchip Technology has a market capitalisation of US$44b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$896m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Should You Add Microchip Technology To Your Watchlist?Microchip Technology's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Microchip Technology is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Microchip Technology has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Although Microchip Technology certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Salesforce’s LLMs – including CodeGen, CodeT5+, and CodeTF – help companies increase productivity, bridge the talent gap, reduce the cost of implementations, and better detect incidents.Bring Your Own Model (BYOM): Customers who have trained their own domain-specific models outside of Salesforce will benefit from AI Cloud while storing data on their own infrastructure. These models, whether running through Amazon SageMaker or Google's Vertex AI, will connect directly to AI Cloud through the Einstein GPT Trust Layer. In this scenario, customer data can remain within the customers' trust boundaries.Business Ready: AI will fuel more than $15 trillion in global economic growth and boost GDP by 26% by 2030*. AI Cloud will harness the full power of Salesforce, helping make companies and employees more productive and efficient.Generative AI across every Salesforce application: Salesforce is bringing trusted generative AI to every product with Sales GPT, Service GPT, Marketing GPT, Commerce GPT, Slack GPT, Tableau GPT, Flow GPT, and Apex GPT.

26,640b11f7-6363-3377-82d7-cc7ce9d341ca,NWS,2023-06-12,News Corporation's (NASDAQ:NWSA) Stock Is Going Strong: Have Financials A Role To Play?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-corporations-nasdaq-nwsa-stock-124112500.html,1686487272.0,STORY,['NWSA'],"[News' (NASDAQ:NWSA) stock is up by a considerable 23% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on News'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for News How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for News is:3.9% = US$346m ÷ US$9.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.04.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of News' Earnings Growth And 3.9% ROEIt is hard to argue that News' ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 13%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Despite this, surprisingly, News saw an exceptional 59% net income growth over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared News' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is NWSA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is News Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?News' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 24%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 76% of its profits. So it looks like News is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, News is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of eight years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 21%. Still, forecasts suggest that News' future ROE will rise to 6.5% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we feel that News certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

We have written a lot over the years about how Amazon's culture and organizational structures prioritize and enable rapid innovation. Historically, programming code was written in a sequential waterfall fashion, creating significant interdependencies between different developer teams in the organization and slowing down innovation. Amazon famously required all developers to expose their work externally via standardized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). A novel and risky approach, it enabled development teams to work in parallel, created a rapid feedback loop with customers, and turned Amazon into one of the most innovative companies in the world. The culture of constant experimentation and the willingness to take risks and fail fast (remember the Amazon Fire phone?) became the core pillars of the company's culture and led to revolutionary ideas like third-party sales (letting competitors sell similar products alongside your own), Amazon Prime Video, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), making the company a disruptor and leader in multiple multi-trillion-dollar industries.""Story continuesPhoto by Sunrise King on UnsplashOur calculations show that Amazon.com, Inc.

The annual survey, which aims to understand the current and future state of the HR landscape, found that more than 75% of HR leaders at companies with 20-plus employees, and just over half (51%) at companies with 5-19 employees, plan to use artificial intelligence (AI) in the next 12 months. Respondents at larger companies (20-plus employees) expect they’ll use AI mostly for applicant tracking purposes (30%), followed by assessing employee satisfaction (29%).The survey of U.S.-based business and HR leaders at companies with five or more employees found that investments in HR technology are expected to help increase employee productivity and improve the employee experience.""We believe it’s a great time for employers to get back to basics, but with a modern approach,"" said Jeff Williams, vice president of enterprise and HR solutions at Paychex. ""Ground employees in the vision of their company and in the purpose of their work; fund benefits and retirement options that allow workers to feel secure and be present; cultivate and develop talent so they want to stay and thrive; and build leadership routines, operating systems, and human connections that meet people where they are today.""The research revealed that the following employee issues are big challenges for leaders at companies with 20-plus employees:Employee burnout (32%)Quiet quitting (27%)Full-time employees working a full-time second job (25%)Boomerang employees (23%)Polywork (23%)Employees moonlighting with a second part-time job (20%)Businesses with 20-plus employees plan to offer benefits that support employees’ overall well-being in the next 12 months, such as Employee Assistance Programs (30%), a shorter work week (28%), and childcare cost assistance (28%).

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Paychex's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Paychex How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Paychex is:44% = US$1.5b ÷ US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.44 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Paychex's Earnings Growth And 44% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Paychex has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 8.5% net income growth seen by Paychex over the past five years. growthNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Paychex's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PAYX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Paychex Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Paychex has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 76%, meaning that it is left with only 24% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Moreover, Paychex is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 78%. As a result, Paychex's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 47% for future ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Paychex has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

Three criteria come to mind when it comes to blue-chip stocks.First, they’re part of the S&amp;P 500. However, that doesn’t mean they’re blue-chip stocks. For example, the company in the index with the smallest market capitalization is Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) at $3.44 billion. It might be a decent-sized company, but it hasn’t been blue-chip for over a decade.The second criterion is that they pay a dividend. Again, they don’t have to be a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrats club, but they should be growing their payout.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLastly, their long-term debt should be insignificant. For me, that’s less than 10% of the market cap. In addition, it would be nice if they had more than $100 million in free cash flow to invest in the business.So, who are these best blue chips poised for growth? Well, for starters, they’re stocks from three different sectors. Secondly, at least one of them won’t be a mega-cap and will have a market cap of less than $25 billion.Fastenal (FAST)Source: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.comI’ve been a Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) fan for years. Recently, I included FAST in a group of seven stocks to own in February 2021. The first time I wrote about the industrial distributor was in March 2012.I was thumbs down on the stock suggesting it was overpriced at 25x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Today, its EV/EBITDA is 18.69x, less than its five-year average.So, suppose you buy Fastenal at current prices. In that case, you’re getting shares in a company with a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $767.2 million [cash flow], total debt of $648.1 million, or 2.1% of its $30.8 billion market cap, and generating a 2.6% dividend yield.Year-to-date, Fastenal’s stock’s up nearly 14%, 431 basis points higher than the index. So over the past five years, it’s almost doubled the index’s performance.Story continuesAs businesses go, you can’t get much more blue-chip than Fastenal.Robert Half International (RHI)The Robert Half International (RHI) logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comRobert Half International (NYSE:RHI) was one of the first human resource consulting firms.

41,986a9182-4d16-3678-849f-42208a67d592,TDG,2023-06-12,Investing in TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) five years ago would have delivered you a 171% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-transdigm-group-nyse-tdg-110019409.html,1686567619,STORY,['TDG'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) which saw its share price drive 135% higher over five years. In the last week the share price is up 1.5%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, TransDigm Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.2% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 45.87.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TransDigm Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think TransDigm Group will grow revenue in the future.A Dividend LostThe share price return figures discussed above don't include the value of dividends paid previously, but the total shareholder return (TSR) does. By accounting for the value of dividends paid, the TSR can be seen as a more complete measure of the value a company brings to its shareholders. TransDigm Group's TSR over the last 5 years is 171%; better than its share price return. Even though the company isn't paying dividends at the moment, it has done in the past.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that TransDigm Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 51% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 22% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for TransDigm Group   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Never miss another market-moving alert.A lackluster response to Apple's Vision ProWall Street reacted with caution to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, Vision Pro, which comes at a higher-than-expected price of $3,499.CFRA, for example, saidAlthough we are impressed by its best-in-class hardware/immersive capabilities, we think AAPL failed to identify why it's a must-own device for consumers, at least for now. Still, the company's entry into the space and greater engagement from developers will help support adoption and new use cases over time.Goldman Sachs said it is encouraged by long-term growth prospects, ""but expect near-term financial contributions to be limited"" particularly given the high retail price point and media reports that it may be sold at breakeven.And BofA similarly said it expects that ""adoption will take time.""Apple shares initially sank on news of the launch but partially recovered, and ended the week down just 0.9%. The stock is up some 45% year to date.Coinbase sued by SECCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) took a dive early in the week after it was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an alleged breach of U.S. securities rules.“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.The exchange is accused of making billions of dollars “unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.”Story continuesBofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and said, ""[W]e think these latest developments illustrate ongoing regulatory headwinds, which not only could threaten part of [Coinbase]’s business model, but also represent a big management distraction.""Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest increased its stake in the company, as the stock hit near five-month lows. Wood has repeatedly expressed confidence in Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, and has cited a $1 million long-term price target for Bitcoin on the belief that it is an effective inflation hedge.Coinbase shares fell nearly 16% for the week, having lost ground Monday as well after the SEC sued Binance. It's still up nearly 60% for the year. General Motors to partake in Tesla's charging networkGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra confirmed this week that the company is preparing to integrate the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, designed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), into its EVs beginning in 2025.The announcement, made during a live meeting on Twitter Space with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, mirrors a similar revolution made late last month when neighboring rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) also announced a collaboration with Musk's Tesla.These partnerships allow Ford and GM customers to access the extensive network of Tesla Superchargers.The next day, White House officials handed Tesla another win when they announced that the company’s Superchargers would be eligible to receive a portion of federal funds, amounting in the billions, so long as the chargers also included CCS connections.After the GM news, Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $300 from $215, reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating, and added the shares to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""GM climbed more than 5% for the week to $36.23. Tesla was up 4% to $244.40, extending an over 117% gain year to date.Amazon to launch ad-supported Prime Video tier: reportAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to launch an advertising-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming services as part of a move to bolster growth from entertainment, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount (NASDAQ:PARAA), meanwhile, are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazon’s Prime Video channels.Bank of America analysts believe the ad-supported tier makes sense for Prime Video.""Amazon’s user data, existing relationships with retail advertisers, and extensive ad sales teams provide a competitive advantage for monetizing ad-streaming. Also, tiering may enable Amazon to raise fees on ad-free Prime tiers, which would follow recent fee increases for various Prime and 3P services,"" it wrote in a client note.The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.Warner Discovery and Paramount closed the week up 18% and 5%, respectively, following the news. Amazon ended nearly breakeven for the week.Netflix scoops up new subscribers amid password-sharing crackdownNetflix climbed after The Wall Street Journal reported that the crackdown on password sharing in the U.S. delivered a new subscriber windfall in its earliest days.Citing data from Antenna, the WSJ said the streaming giant gained more new U.S. subscriptions between May 25 and May 28, not long after it notified users in the U.S. and other countries of the limits than in any other four-day period since Antenna commenced compiling the data in 2019.The jump in subscribers suggests Netflix’s decision to end password sharing is yielding results.The move to end password sharing means users who share an account outside the same home must pay an extra $7.99 a month to watch. In addition, the number of extra members customers could add to their account is limited, depending on the tier they pay for.Shares rose just under 5% for the week, with year-to-date gains totaling over 40%.Senad Karaahmetovic, Sam Boughedda, Ambar Warrick, and Michael Elkins contributed to this report.Jump on the biggest tech news for your portfolio amid a barrage of market headlines: Always be the first to know with InvestingPro.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: A tepid response to Apple's Vision Pro; SEC vs. CoinbaseSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.01%Investors rethink recession plays, boosting U.S. stock market laggards]"

Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.62bUS$5.28bUS$4.42bUS$3.95bUS$3.68bUS$3.52bUS$3.44bUS$3.41bUS$3.41bUS$3.43bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ -10.75%Est @ -6.89%Est @ -4.19%Est @ -2.30%Est @ -0.98%Est @ -0.05%Est @ 0.60% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$6.0kUS$4.3kUS$3.3kUS$2.7kUS$2.2kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$42bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$42b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$98.8, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Phillips 66 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.405. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Phillips 66StrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Expedia Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Expedia Group is:9.9% = US$326m ÷ US$3.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.10 in profit.Does Expedia Group Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Expedia Group has a lower ROE than the average (17%) in the Hospitality industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Expedia Group's Debt And Its 9.9% Return On EquityExpedia Group clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.90. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Expedia Group may not be the best stock to buy.

Data to be shared include results from the Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating efinopegdutide in adult patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Separately, efinopegdutide was recently granted Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a potential treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of NAFLD that includes inflammation and damage to the liver. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates to treat serious conditions and fulfill an unmet medical need. Currently, there are no approved therapies for NASH.""We are looking forward to sharing detailed findings from the Phase 2a study of efinopegdutide with the scientific community at the EASL Congress,"" said Sam Engel, associate vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Significant patient need remains for new treatment options for NASH. These compelling data in patients with NAFLD, along with the recent receipt of Fast Track Designation from the FDA, provide strong rationale for advancing efinopegdutide into Phase 2b development for patients with NASH.""Details on Featured Oral Presentation for efinopegdutideA Phase 2a, randomized, active-comparator-controlled, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efinopegdutide in individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Friday, June 23; 8:30-8:45 a.m. CEST.Story continuesAbout MK-6024 (efinopegdutide)MK-6024 is an investigational peptide and dual agonist at glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucagon receptors in clinical development for the treatment of NASH.MK-6024 was investigated in a randomized, active comparator-controlled, open-label Phase 2a study to evaluate the compound’s efficacy in liver fat reduction and safety in participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. MK-6024 is administered subcutaneously once per week. Data from this study informed the design of the Phase 2b study that Merck plans to start in June 2023.MK-6024 is being developed under an exclusive licensing agreement between Merck and Hanmi Pharmaceutical for the treatment of patients with NASH.More information about our clinical trials is available at www.merckclinicaltrials.com or on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT05877547 and NCT04944992.About NAFLD and NASHNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic and progressive condition in which fat builds up in the liver. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe type of NAFLD that includes inflammation and damage to the liver and is closely related to obesity, pre-diabetes and diabetes. It is known as a silent disease with few or no symptoms, however, certain health conditions and disease – including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes – make you more likely to develop NAFLD. There are about 25% to 30% of people in the U.S. living with NAFLD and about 2% to 5% of people in the U.S. living with NASH.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

The unprecedented speed at which COVID vaccines were developed during the pandemic meant that potential uncommon side-effects may not have been detected as readily as they might have been in traditionally longer trials.EMA has said that safety monitoring had not been compromised during the fast-track assessment.The EMA had registered almost 1.7 million spontaneous reports of suspected side-effects by May, which translates into about 0.2 for every 100 administered doses.Almost 768 million vaccine doses have been administered in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.The most common temporary side-effects are headache, fever, fatigue and muscle pain.The EMA also monitors adverse events or illness after vaccination, and checks for frequencies that surpass normal rates in the non-vaccinated population.LIABILITYIt is not clear who would pay the legal costs or compensation if the plaintiff wins the case.Sources have said some of the EU's bulk purchase agreements with vaccine makers, including BioNTech-Pfizer, contained full or partial liability waivers for both legal costs and potential compensation, which could force EU governments to bear some of the costs.Like many countries, Germany also has a public sector financial support scheme for people who suffer permanent harm from vaccines, known as a no-fault compensation programme, but participation in the programme does not block someone seeking damages separately.The United States has granted manufacturers immunity from liability for COVID vaccines that receive regulatory approval.Rogert &amp; Ulbrich says it has filed about 250 cases for clients seeking damages for alleged side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines.Another law firm, Caesar-Preller, says it is representing 100 cases, with both firms saying separately they cover almost all cases in Germany between them.A handful of similar cases have been filed in Italy.($1 = 0.9289 euros) (Reporting by Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss; additional reporting by Emilio Parodi in Milan and Natalie Grover and Sam Tobin in London; editing by Josephine Mason and Mark Potter)]"

Beer is often touted as recession-proof, so large companies may continue to earn solid profits even as economic activity slows.""Most cost-conscious consumers are still buying the same volume of beer, but in the less expensive category of beer,"" said Neil Reid, professor of geography at the University of Toledo, who has researched the beer industry.Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect annual revenue to grow about 6% for Molson Coors and 7.5% for AB InBev in 2023, while craft beer maker Boston Beer Co is expected to post a near 3% fall in revenue, compared with last year's 1.6% rise.Overall U.S. beer sales grew 1.8% in the 12 weeks ended May 20, according to data from research firms NielsenIQ and TD Cowen.Craft beers are more expensive and made from higher-quality ingredients, and have a consumer base that rarely shifts to cheaper brews. However, those brands have suffered a drop-off in demand since the pandemic as premium brews rely heavily on in-store shopping.""The craft beer category has suffered from a couple of headwinds. One is kind of just the legacy issues from the pandemic, but also from a trade-down because craft tends to be priced at a premium,"" TD Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said.Sam Adams maker Boston Beer, the largest craft beer maker, saw its market share slip last year.The company's market share was 1% in the overall U.S. beer industry, down from 1.1% last year for the first four months of 2023, according to data firm Numerator.Sales growth in Molson's Blue Moon, its craft brand, declined 8.6% in the 12 weeks ended May 20 on a year-over-year basis, according to data from NielsenIQ and TD Cowen.Story continuesMeanwhile, AB InBev's market share in dollar terms rose to 40.4% in the first four months of 2023 in overall U.S. beer sales, up from 38.3% at the same time last year.Molson Coors' market share was second at 25.3% and Constellation Brands, maker of Corona and Modelo, was at 9.4%, compared with 23% and 8.8% a year earlier, respectively.While AB InBev and Molson Coors bought brewers to expand into the craft brewing segment starting in 2011, the companies have seen little success and have lost market share in the category.As a result, Constellation Brands' Funky Buddha and AB InBev's Appalachian Mountain Brewery were sold back to the founders in May.The larger brewers are less likely to buy additional craft brewers and instead invest in their best-selling products like Miller Lite, Coors Light, Bud Light and Beyond Beer products, said Jon Reynolds, certified instructor in the business of craft beer at the University of Vermont.Giants such as Molson Coors and AB InBev are insulated somewhat from economic downturns by their diversified portfolio that allows them to sell not just premium brews but also cheaper varieties with low alcohol content like Bud Light and Miller Lite, Reid said.AB InBev executives said the company is tripling its investment in Bud Light for the summer, even though sales have been hit after a social media promotion on April 1 with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney resulted in a backlash from U.S. conservatives.A 16-ounce six-pack of AB InBev's Natural Light and Molson's Keystone Light averages about $4.99 in the United States, making them lower-priced beers.Bud Light and Coors Light, popular premium light beers, average about $7.40 for a 12-ounce six-pack, while Boston Beer's Sam Adams costs between $10 to $12.AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the beer industry in the United States remains resilient, with industry volume trends improving sequentially and sales on a dollar basis up 3%.""The American consumer likes light beer,"" Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley said at a conference in early June. ""I think dynamics within the subsegment might change, but the overall consumption of light beer is not going to change materially.""(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

It’s one of just two locations on the West Coast that is open to drivers with the latest innovation from Tesla Inc.: the Magic Dock.Magic Dock is a Tesla connector that allows other EVs to use the company’s extensive charger network. It’s hardware that’s added to the charging station itself — there’s no need for drivers to carry an adapter in the trunk.“I plug it into my truck, and it just works,” said Bowe, 49, a senior manager at FedEx. “You hear the Magic Dock click and latch into place and it starts charging. It’s beautiful.”Tesla, which is headquartered in Austin, is known for its sleek electric cars. The company led by CEO Elon Musk sold more than 1.3 million vehicles globally in 2022 and aims to sell at least 1.8 million in 2023. The first Blade Runner-esque Cybertrucks are slated to be handed over later this year.But Tesla’s low-key and ubiquitous Superchargers, which now cover much of North America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, are proving to be the shrewdest, and most strategic, product of all. Tesla dominates EV sales in the US and, not surprisingly, is conquering reliable fast-charging. At the end of the first quarter, the company had nearly 5,000 charger stations and more than 45,000 charging stalls or connectors globally, according to company filings. Many are located off of freeways in shopping plazas, and they often have several stalls for charging.Story continuesBut it’s not just the Magic Dock. In recent weeks, two of Tesla’s biggest rivals — Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. — announced they will partner with Tesla on charging. In both cases, Ford and GM customers can buy a Tesla-made adapter that will allow them to access more than 12,000 Superchargers starting early next year. And in 2025, Tesla’s unique charging port will be built into Ford and GM’s electric vehicles. Selling a car is one thing; selling consumers an EV charging experience is another, and one that provides an ongoing revenue stream. Tesla may rake in as much as $3 billion a year from charging other manufacturers’ EVs by 2030, according to Piper Sandler &amp; Co.Mary Barra, the chief executive officer of GM, joined Musk on Twitter — which Musk owns — on Thursday to announce her company’s new partnership. “Not only will it help make the transition to electric vehicles more seamless for our customers, but it could help move the industry toward a single North American Charging Standard,” she said.In unveiling his company’s deal in May, Ford CEO Jim Farley mentioned “reliability” more than once and said he was “really pumped.”“We don’t want the Tesla Supercharger network to be like a walled garden,” Musk said during the event with Farley. “We want to be supportive of electrification and sustainable transport in general.”Tesla is the largest installer of ultra-fast chargers in the US, according to BloombergNEF, accounting for 71% of installations in 2022. BNEF’s latest Electric Vehicle Outlook 2023, published last week, forecasts that electric models in the US will make up nearly 28% of passenger vehicle sales by 2026, up from 7.6% in 2022.More EVs on the roads means that more cars will be sharing the nation’s chargers. In its report, BNEF said that support for charging infrastructure needs to be expanded “dramatically, including for remote and otherwise under-served locations.”The White House—eager to spur adoption of EVs—announced the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program earlier this year, which allocates $5 billion to states to build out fast charging. As part of that announcement, Tesla pledged to make at least 3,500 new and existing Superchargers open to non-Tesla EVs.“We have understood since day one that a great charging experience is the linchpin to electric vehicle adoption,” said Rebecca Tinucci, who leads Tesla’s charging infrastructure team, at the company’s investor day in March. “Getting here meant we spent 10 years building charging infrastructure when basically no one else in the industry would do it.”In September 2012, Musk unveiled Tesla's first six Superchargers. Constructed in secret, the early sites were along California highway corridors in cities like Folsom and Gilroy. Forget range anxiety: Tesla wanted to make it easy for its customers to go on long road trips.“This is not some figment of the imagination,” Musk said during the splashy launch event at Tesla’s design studio near Los Angeles. “I think this day will actually go down as being quite historic. I want you to get out there and spread the word. People have this idea that if you have an electric car that you have no freedom, that you’re stuck. There's this idea that you can’t go anywhere. What we’re showing here today is that you have more freedom than anything.”Eleven years later, Tesla’s decision to invest billions of dollars into owning and operating its own charging network has given it a formidable edge in the US over automotive and charging rivals alike. Charging companies like Electrify America, EVgo Inc. and ChargePoint Holdings Inc. have struggled with the perception — and reality — that they are not as dependable as Tesla.Read More: Why So Many Electric Car Chargers in America Don't Work“Ford and GM’s partnership with Tesla reinforces the message that there are still issues with reliability for other charging providers,” said John Gartner, senior director at the Center for Sustainable Energy. “What sets Tesla apart is the reliability. Tesla made the investment: they are both the automaker and the charging network operator, and their customers are one and the same. No one else has done it as boldly, as comprehensively or with the quality as Tesla to date.”While other automakers spent millions on Super Bowl ads, Tesla studded the national landscape with chargers emblazoned with the Tesla logo that it designed itself, with a seamless user experience in mind.“From a marketing standpoint, Tesla’s Superchargers are a huge advantage,” said Owuraka Koney, managing director at Jennison Associates LLC, a major investor that has held Tesla shares since 2011. “Range anxiety is still an issue for consumers, and access to Supercharging helps to drive demand for Tesla right now.”There are two charging options in the US: Tesla’s, and what’s known as CCS, or the Combined Charging System. Last fall, Tesla invited automotive and charging-network rivals to add the Tesla connector to their vehicles and equipment. Tesla went so far as to call its option NACS, or the North American Charging Standard.At first, it didn’t seem like anyone would take Tesla up on its offer. In March, Tesla showed off the Magic Dock as part of its investor day. The rollout of the Magic Dock has been slow and deliberate: the company’s website shows just 11 locations, two in California and nine in New York.But behind the scenes, there was momentum. Ford’s Jim Farley told CNBC that he had been working with Tesla “for a couple of years” on the charging deal. The announcement from GM makes it increasingly likely that Tesla’s standard will become the prevailing charging standard in the US.A recent road trip from Oakland, California, to Los Angeles shows just how vast Tesla’s charging advantage — and opportunity — is. Harris Ranch, located on Interstate 5, is the go-to place to charge between the Bay Area and LA, and that’s the first place I stopped with a Model Y rented from Hertz to charge up. The cattle ranch and resort has 98 Superchargers installed, making it the largest Supercharger station in the world. There didn’t appear to be any Magic Docks, but it was easy to imagine them being integrated into the existing chargers.Just 27 miles down the road is another Supercharger in Kettleman City. This location is famous for its comfortable lounge, which is exclusively for use by Tesla owners: you need the company’s app to access a code that you punch into the locked door to enter.On a Friday afternoon, the lounge was staffed by cheerful baristas whipping up cappuccinos and mochas. There was free wi-fi, clean bathrooms and roughly half a dozen black leather chairs to sit in. Outdoor tables with large umbrellas provided shade. While waiting for my iced latte, I browsed the rack of merchandise: mostly black t-shirts featuring Tesla’s products as well as a few baseball hats and beanie caps.On my 880-mile round-trip drive to and from LA, I charged the car five times: at Harris Ranch, and once in downtown LA. On the way home, I took the far slower but more scenic Highway 101 route, charging in Oxnard, San Luis Obispo and Gilroy. The Model Y preconditioned the battery as I navigated to the nearest charger, and every charger worked.Tesla, which has $22 billion in cash, is aggressively expanding its network and adds new locations nearly every day. The company is working on quicker charge times, as well as a trip planning feature that optimizes Supercharging site utilization.Tinucci ended her investor day presentation with an architectural rendering of a Tesla-branded drive-in diner with Superchargers and an outdoor movie theater. It’s not just fantasy: Tesla has filed planning documents for a Tesla West Hollywood Diner with the city of Los Angeles.Tesla has long pushed the envelope of what the fueling of the future will be. But now Tesla customers will have to share the network that has been theirs, exclusively, for so long.It remains to be seen how this culture clash will play out. Will Tesla continue to roll out Magic Dock? Will Tesla enact a two-tiered billing system: one charging rate for Tesla owners, and a second, more expensive rate for Ford and GM customers? Will lounges like the one in Kettleman City eventually open to non-Tesla owners? Tesla didn’t respond to inquiries for this story.But the Magic Dock offers some lessons. The charging port on a Tesla is on the driver’s side of the vehicle, in the back, so you back up close to the Supercharger. Most other EVs on the road today have their charging ports located at the front of the car.“I was very aware that I am not a Tesla owner,” Bowe said of charging his Ford Lightning in Scotts Valley. “I had to pull nose-in and use the stall to my right, when the correct stall would have been the one to the left. So basically I was taking up two spots, and was using the ‘wrong’ charger.”John Gartner said that Tesla must strike a balance, keep loyal Tesla customers happy while sharing the Supercharging bounty with other EV owners.“At what point do you dilute the customer experience?” Gartner asked. “If you open it up to everyone, then it’s no longer special.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft’s Sudden AI Dominance Is Scrambling Silicon Valley’s Power StructureIs AT&amp;T’s RTO Mandate a Mass Layoff in Disguise?A Saudi Airline Embraces Luxury to End Emirates and Qatar’s Gulf DominanceLayoffs and AI Are Changing Tech’s Once-Invincible Job MarketHow Nvidia Became ChatGPT’s Brain and Joined the $1 Trillion Club©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Never miss another market-moving alert.A lackluster response to Apple's Vision ProWall Street reacted with caution to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, Vision Pro, which comes at a higher-than-expected price of $3,499.CFRA, for example, saidAlthough we are impressed by its best-in-class hardware/immersive capabilities, we think AAPL failed to identify why it's a must-own device for consumers, at least for now. Still, the company's entry into the space and greater engagement from developers will help support adoption and new use cases over time.Goldman Sachs said it is encouraged by long-term growth prospects, ""but expect near-term financial contributions to be limited"" particularly given the high retail price point and media reports that it may be sold at breakeven.And BofA similarly said it expects that ""adoption will take time.""Apple shares initially sank on news of the launch but partially recovered, and ended the week down just 0.9%. The stock is up some 45% year to date.Coinbase sued by SECCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) took a dive early in the week after it was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an alleged breach of U.S. securities rules.“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.The exchange is accused of making billions of dollars “unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.”Story continuesBofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and said, ""[W]e think these latest developments illustrate ongoing regulatory headwinds, which not only could threaten part of [Coinbase]’s business model, but also represent a big management distraction.""Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest increased its stake in the company, as the stock hit near five-month lows. Wood has repeatedly expressed confidence in Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, and has cited a $1 million long-term price target for Bitcoin on the belief that it is an effective inflation hedge.Coinbase shares fell nearly 16% for the week, having lost ground Monday as well after the SEC sued Binance. It's still up nearly 60% for the year. General Motors to partake in Tesla's charging networkGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra confirmed this week that the company is preparing to integrate the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, designed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), into its EVs beginning in 2025.The announcement, made during a live meeting on Twitter Space with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, mirrors a similar revolution made late last month when neighboring rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) also announced a collaboration with Musk's Tesla.These partnerships allow Ford and GM customers to access the extensive network of Tesla Superchargers.The next day, White House officials handed Tesla another win when they announced that the company’s Superchargers would be eligible to receive a portion of federal funds, amounting in the billions, so long as the chargers also included CCS connections.After the GM news, Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $300 from $215, reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating, and added the shares to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""GM climbed more than 5% for the week to $36.23. Tesla was up 4% to $244.40, extending an over 117% gain year to date.Amazon to launch ad-supported Prime Video tier: reportAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to launch an advertising-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming services as part of a move to bolster growth from entertainment, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount (NASDAQ:PARAA), meanwhile, are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazon’s Prime Video channels.Bank of America analysts believe the ad-supported tier makes sense for Prime Video.""Amazon’s user data, existing relationships with retail advertisers, and extensive ad sales teams provide a competitive advantage for monetizing ad-streaming. Also, tiering may enable Amazon to raise fees on ad-free Prime tiers, which would follow recent fee increases for various Prime and 3P services,"" it wrote in a client note.The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.Warner Discovery and Paramount closed the week up 18% and 5%, respectively, following the news. Amazon ended nearly breakeven for the week.Netflix scoops up new subscribers amid password-sharing crackdownNetflix climbed after The Wall Street Journal reported that the crackdown on password sharing in the U.S. delivered a new subscriber windfall in its earliest days.Citing data from Antenna, the WSJ said the streaming giant gained more new U.S. subscriptions between May 25 and May 28, not long after it notified users in the U.S. and other countries of the limits than in any other four-day period since Antenna commenced compiling the data in 2019.The jump in subscribers suggests Netflix’s decision to end password sharing is yielding results.The move to end password sharing means users who share an account outside the same home must pay an extra $7.99 a month to watch. In addition, the number of extra members customers could add to their account is limited, depending on the tier they pay for.Shares rose just under 5% for the week, with year-to-date gains totaling over 40%.Senad Karaahmetovic, Sam Boughedda, Ambar Warrick, and Michael Elkins contributed to this report.Jump on the biggest tech news for your portfolio amid a barrage of market headlines: Always be the first to know with InvestingPro.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: A tepid response to Apple's Vision Pro; SEC vs. CoinbaseSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.01%Investors rethink recession plays, boosting U.S. stock market laggards]"

It's also good to see that the stock is up 9.7% in a year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for CSX In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.CSX's earnings per share are down 0.3% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We doubt the modest 1.4% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. On the other hand, CSX's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 4.2% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthCSX is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, CSX's TSR for the last 5 years was 56%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that CSX has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 11% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 9%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on News'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for News How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for News is:3.9% = US$346m ÷ US$9.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.04.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of News' Earnings Growth And 3.9% ROEIt is hard to argue that News' ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 13%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Despite this, surprisingly, News saw an exceptional 59% net income growth over the past five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared News' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is NWSA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is News Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?News' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 24%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 76% of its profits. So it looks like News is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, News is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of eight years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 21%. Still, forecasts suggest that News' future ROE will rise to 6.5% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we feel that News certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Gensysn uses a cryptographic verification network that without the need for intermediaries allows users to determine that machine learning work shared over the protocol has been finished correctly..“The realization of its (AI’s) potential requires huge computational power,” Gensysn co-founder Ben Fielding, said in a press release Monday (UTC). “We’re harnessing the electricity of a new age and making it available to everyone at unlimited scale and fair market prices.”Fielding said that such widespread accessibility was “essential” for avoiding “dangerously biased technology serving the many but built by the few. The key to useful, aligned AI is allowing everyone in the world to contribute to its development.”In the release, Gensyn co-founder Harry Grieve also noted that “with decentralized networks, value simply accrues to the network as a function of supply and demand.”“It also sharply increases the amount of compute supply by connecting previously underutilized hardware from around the world,” he said.The announcement comes amid surging interest in AI, which could potentially transform the way businesses in a range of industries operate, including media, retail, manufacturing and financial services.

(NYSE:APD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Air Products and Chemicals, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Air Products and Chemicals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Air Products and Chemicals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Air Products and Chemicals. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.6% and 5.8% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$206m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Air Products and Chemicals has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Additionally, edge computing enables the launch of “new interactive, human experiences, [including] self-driving cars, autonomous robots.” And it allows firms to automate functions in their physical locations and enhance the technology of their facilities easily. Given the many use cases of edge computing, it’s worthwhile for investors to find the best edge computing stocks to buy.Even better, the edge computing market could surge from $15.95 billion as of 2022 to nearly $140 billion in 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights. In fact, here are three companies that are well-positioned to exploit this growth, making them very promising edge computing stocks. Given their low valuations, I believe that all three can skyrocket over the next year.ATENA10 Networks$14.49AKAMAkamai$93.84FSLYFastly$16.46InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA10 Networks (ATEN)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA10 Networks (NYSE:ATEN) provides networking products, application delivery products, and load balancing solutions for edge networks. In 2022, A10, which also provides IT security systems, generated revenue of $280 million, up from $250 million in 2021 and $225 in 2020. Its operating income dropped slightly to $51.2 million in 2022 from $53 million in 2021 amid high cost pressures, but its OI was far above its 2020 level of $33.4 million and its 2019 level of $17.7 million.Last quarter, the firm’s top line fell 8% year-over-year amid “macro headwinds and project delays.” But it still expects its earnings per share, excluding certain items, to climb at least 10% this year. So it sounds like the firm was indeed hurt by temporary challenges last quarter. The shares are changing hands at a relatively low forward price-earnings ratio of 17.5 times and analysts, on average, expect its EPS to climb to 94 cents next year from 80 cents in 2023.Story continuesAkamai (AKAM)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Akamai’s (NASDAQ:AKAM) thousands of distributed servers are spread throughout most parts of the world, allowing customers to attain the benefits of edge computing. Moreover, the company markets a product called EdgeWorkers that allows firms to create services through its network. Akamai also offers a “data management and storage solution” called EdgeKv. The product ” enables JavaScript developers to build EdgeWorker applications to improve data management.”For Q1, Akamai reported that its revenue increased 1.4% versus the same period a year earlier. For all of 2023, the company expects its top line to come in at about $3.785 billion, compared with the $3.6 billion that it generated in 2022. Perhaps most importantly and certainly most impressively, AKAM predicts that it will report 2023 EPS, excluding certain “one-time items,” of $5.69-$5.84, well above the $5.37 of adjusted EPS that it reported last year.Akamai’s forward price-earnings ratio is a rather low 14.9, making it one of the more affordable edge computing stocks to buy.Fastly (FSLY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

However, I became disillusioned with the stock, due to its very high valuation and a “massive outage” suffered by the company in July 2021. However, the stock’s valuation is now reasonable and the company’s business seems to have recovered from the outage. The forward price-earnings ratio of 3.5 times is fairly attractive given its rapid growth and huge potential, and analysts, on average, expect its top line to come in at $501 million this year, versus $432 million last year. And one analyst expects the company to break into the black next year with earnings per share of 7 cents.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

(Nasdaq: NDAQ), a technology company serving the global financial system, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Adenza, a provider of mission-critical risk management and regulatory software to the financial services industry, from Thoma Bravo, a leading software investment firm, for $10.5 billion in cash and shares of common stock. The acquisition accelerates Nasdaq’s strategic vision to become the trusted fabric of the world’s financial system. Upon the closing of the transaction, Holden Spaht, a Managing Partner at Thoma Bravo, is expected to be appointed to Nasdaq’s Board of Directors, which will be expanded to twelve members.Adenza is a fast-growing software company created through the combination of two highly respected and well-recognized global brands – Calypso and AxiomSL. Calypso serves capital markets participants with end-to-end treasury, risk, and collateral management workflows, and AxiomSL supports financial institutions with leading regulatory and compliance software.The addition of Adenza to Nasdaq’s trusted brand and platform of mission-critical solutions complements Nasdaq’s Marketplace Technology and Anti-Financial Crime solutions and significantly enhances Nasdaq’s offerings across an even broader spectrum of regulatory technology, compliance, and risk management solutions. With Adenza, Nasdaq will also be able to provide comprehensive support to financial institutions, establishing a multi-asset class, full trade lifecycle platform with unmatched regulatory technology solutions. Story continuesAdenza brings an attractive financial profile, with approximately $590 million of 2023E revenue, organic revenue growth1 of approximately 15%, annual recurring revenue growth of 18%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 58%. The company has a loyal and growing client base, with 98% gross retention, 115% net retention, and a durable mix of approximately 80% recurring revenue. The addition of Adenza is projected to enhance Nasdaq’s already strong financial profile by growing Solutions Businesses revenue2 from 71% of total revenue today to 77% in 2023E, increasing adjusted EBITDA margin to 57%3, and adding approximately $300 million of annual unlevered pre-tax cash flow1.“This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a leading software company that enhances Nasdaq’s position at the heart of the global financial system,” said Adena Friedman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Nasdaq. “The acquisition of Adenza brings together two world-class franchises steeped in market infrastructure, regulatory, and risk management expertise at a time when financial institutions are navigating some of the most complex market dynamics in history. From fast-evolving global regulations to rapidly increasing pressures to modernize infrastructure, our clients are seeking trusted partners equipped to support them in this challenging environment. Nasdaq aspires to be that partner every day, and with Adenza we can offer an even broader range of mission-critical solutions that enhance the liquidity, transparency, and integrity of the world’s financial system.”“The addition of Adenza accelerates our ambition to modernize and advance the world’s economies,” said Tal Cohen, President of Market Platforms, Nasdaq. “It also introduces a fast-growing $10 billion serviceable addressable market to Nasdaq. Since the implementation of Dodd-Frank in 2010, banks have increased their compliance costs by more than $50 billion per year4. With Adenza, we will have a more complete suite of essential software and technology solutions that make managing risks and complying with regulations simpler and more efficient for our clients. With complementary capabilities and geographic footprints, we can see a clear path to deepening our client relationships globally with leading end-to-end platforms across risk, trading, and regulatory reporting.”“When we combined AxiomSL and Calypso almost two years ago under Didier Bouillard’s leadership, we had a vision to create a truly unique software franchise that could help financial institutions across the globe manage their most complex trading, risk, and regulatory reporting requirements,” said Holden Spaht, a Managing Partner at Thoma Bravo. “This acquisition is a clear validation of that strategy, and as part of Nasdaq, Adenza will be in a stronger position to build on its impressive momentum and serve an even larger global client base. Nasdaq has a long and impressive history of developing innovative solutions that have revolutionized the global capital markets, making them the perfect partner for this next phase of Adenza’s journey. We are excited to become a strategic shareholder in Nasdaq and bring our deep software and technology experience to help drive further innovation and digital transformation across the global financial system.”“This transaction is an endorsement of the entire Adenza team and what we have built with Thoma Bravo, from our market-leading products to the immense value we have delivered for our customers,” said Didier Bouillard, Chief Executive Officer at Adenza. “Together with Nasdaq, we will be in an even stronger position to take advantage of the growing market opportunities and to provide customers with expanded solutions to solve their most complex problems.”Compelling Strategic Rationale and Attractive Long-Term Value Creation Excellent Strategic Fit: The acquisition of Adenza is an exciting opportunity to align two great cultures with complementary technologies and client reach to create a world-class technology solutions provider for the financial industry. Both Nasdaq and Adenza drive success with similar client-centric, results-oriented, and innovative cultures. Nasdaq’s trusted brand and leading artificial intelligence and cloud capabilities, combined with Adenza’s modular solutions and streamlined go-to-market operating model, significantly enhances the value proposition to clients with an even broader, more scalable suite of software and technology solutions. Highly Complementary Platforms: The transaction enables Nasdaq to serve an expanded client base with holistic, multi-asset-class, and cloud-enabled risk and regulatory management solutions. With a shared global footprint, Adenza brings additional relationships across the European banking system to Nasdaq’s strong presence in North America and the Asia Pacific region, positioning the business to meet worldwide demand for outsourced risk management and regulatory solutions. Nasdaq and Adenza also bring together complementary capabilities in asset classes to address the full spectrum of clients’ needs from over-the-counter fixed income to listed equities. Strong Growth Opportunities with Secular Tailwinds: Adenza’s focus is uniquely centered around key risk and regulatory trends affecting financial institutions, from continuously evolving regulation and reporting complexity to ongoing digitization of markets and migration to the cloud. Adenza serves a $10 billion SAM5 growing 8% per year, increasing Nasdaq’s SAM by approximately 40% to $34 billion.Contributes to Nasdaq’s Strong Profile and Outlook: The acquisition is expected to grow Nasdaq’s ARR1 as a percentage of 2023 pro forma total revenue to 60% from 56% in 2022 and increase Nasdaq’s Solutions Businesses as a percentage of 2023 pro forma total revenue to 77%, from 71% today. It also increases Nasdaq’s Solutions Businesses medium-term organic revenue growth outlook6 from 7-10% to 8-11%. The transaction also improves Nasdaq’s adjusted EBITDA margins from 55%7 to 57% on a 2023 pro forma basis. The acquisition is expected to enhance Nasdaq’s growth, margins, and revenue quality and deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS accretion by the end of year two. Compelling Synergies: The addition of Adenza provides significant value creation potential over the medium and long term. Nasdaq expects to achieve $80 million in run-rate net expense synergies by the end of year two through functional alignment, product rationalization, location optimization, and consolidation of vendors and real estate. The transaction is also expected to unlock additional value through cross-sell opportunities, with anticipated run-rate revenue synergies of $50 million in the medium term and $100 million over the long term.Alignment with Nasdaq’s M&amp;A Criteria: Adenza meets Nasdaq’s acquisition criteria across all dimensions, delivering tight strategic fit and cultural alignment, enhancing performance and valuation potential, and meeting clear and consistent financial requirements. Nasdaq’s enterprise-wide return on invested capital will return to greater than 10% by year five.Financing, Balance Sheet Impact, and ApprovalsNasdaq is acquiring Adenza for $10.5 billion, comprised of $5.75 billion in cash and 85.6 million shares of Nasdaq common stock, based on the volume-weighted average price per share over 15 consecutive trading days prior to signing. Nasdaq has obtained fully committed bridge financing for the cash portion of the consideration and plans to issue approximately $5.9 billion of debt between signing and closing and use the proceeds to replace the bridge commitment.At the closing of the transaction, Nasdaq will issue the shares to the owners of Adenza, which is a company controlled by Thoma Bravo, representing approximately 14.9% of the outstanding shares of Nasdaq.Following the transaction, Nasdaq expects leverage1 of approximately 4.7x and investment grade ratings of BBB/Baa2 Stable. Nasdaq is committed to reducing leverage to 4.0x in 18 months and to approximately 3.3x in 36 months.Nasdaq intends to pursue its existing capital deployment plan, including steadily increasing its dividend per share and dividend payout ratio1 to achieve 35-38% within three to four years. The company intends to repurchase shares over time to partially offset dilution from the transaction in addition to continuing to offset employee share-based compensation.The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close within six to nine months. www.nasdaq.com/adenza.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs &amp; Co.

When used in this communication, words such as “enables”, “intends”, “will”, “can”, “expected”, “enhances” and similar expressions and any other statements that are not historical facts are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, among other things, statements about the potential benefits of the proposed transaction, Nasdaq’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the financial condition, results of operations and business of Nasdaq or Adenza, and the anticipated timing of closing of the proposed transaction. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks related to the ability of Nasdaq to consummate the proposed transaction on a timely basis or at all; Nasdaq’s ability to secure regulatory approvals on the terms expected, in a timely manner or at all; Nasdaq’s ability to successfully integrate Adenza’s operations; Nasdaq’s ability to implement its plans, forecasts and other expectations with respect to Adenza’s business after the completion of the transaction and realize expected synergies; the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the proposed transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the impact of Adenza’s business model on Nasdaq’s ability to forecast revenue results; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; risks related to diverting management’s attention from Nasdaq’s ongoing business operations; the negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the proposed transaction on the market price of Nasdaq’s common stock or on Nasdaq’s operating results; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of litigation or regulatory actions related to the proposed transaction; future levels of Nasdaq’s indebtedness, including additional indebtedness that will be incurred in connection with the proposed transaction; and the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transaction on Adenza’s business relationships, operating results, and business generally.Further information on these and other risks and uncertainties relating to Nasdaq can be found in its reports filed on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and in other filings Nasdaq makes with the SEC from time to time and available at www.sec.gov. These documents are also available under the Investor Relations section of Nasdaq’s website at http://ir.nasdaq.com/investor-relations. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date hereof. Nasdaq and Adenza disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.Supplemental and Non-GAAP InformationAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For certain term-based subscription license agreements related to the Adenza business, ARR is calculated based upon annualized contract value, which deviates from U.S. GAAP revenue recognition whereby a portion of the total contract value is recognized upfront as license revenue, with the remainder allocated to the maintenance and support performance obligation and recognized ratably over the contract term. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.Gross retention is calculated as ARR in the current period over ARR in the prior year period for existing customers excluding price increases and upsells and excluding new customers.Net retention is calculated as ARR in the current period over ARR in the prior year period for existing customers including price increases and upsells and excluding new customers.This press release includes certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures, including organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Organic revenue growth, organic change and organic impact are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve-month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Adjusted EBITDA reflects non-GAAP net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.Nasdaq and Adenza believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Adenza’s financial condition and results of operations. Nasdaq’s and Adenza’s managements use certain of these non-GAAP measures to compare Nasdaq’s and Adenza’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. Nasdaq and Adenza believe presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to financial condition and results of operations.These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating these businesses. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP.A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to their corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors, including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, Nasdaq’s effective tax rate as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.Explanatory notes References to 2023E are based on first quarter actual results and estimated results for the remaining nine months and reflecting expected fully phased in run-rate synergies.References to unlevered pre-tax free cash flow equal cash flow from operations plus cash interest paid and cash taxes paid less capital expenditures.References to Nasdaq leverage are equal to: Gross Debt / Non-GAAP EBITDAReferences to pro forma amounts or results represent a full year of the combined results of Adenza and Nasdaq.References to Adenza financial information were provided by Adenza.-NDAQF-________________________1 Refer to “Supplemental and Non-GAAP Information” at the end of this press release.2 Revenues from Nasdaq’s pre-acquisition Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime segments and Marketplace Technology Business within Market Platforms segment.

Having said that, from a first glance at DENTSPLY SIRONA (NASDAQ:XRAY) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for DENTSPLY SIRONA:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.051 = US$319m ÷ (US$7.7b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, DENTSPLY SIRONA has an ROCE of 5.1%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.1%. View our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA roceIn the above chart we have measured DENTSPLY SIRONA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering DENTSPLY SIRONA here  for free.So How Is DENTSPLY SIRONA's ROCE Trending?We're a bit concerned with the trends, because the business is applying 34% less capital than it was five years ago and returns on that capital have stayed flat. When a company effectively decreases its assets base, it's not usually a sign to be optimistic on that company. Not only that, but the low returns on this capital mentioned earlier would leave most investors unimpressed.What We Can Learn From DENTSPLY SIRONA's ROCEOverall, we're not ecstatic to see DENTSPLY SIRONA reducing the amount of capital it employs in the business. Since the stock has declined 10% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesIf you're still interested in DENTSPLY SIRONA it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

106,87ecc8d4-fcfa-3033-aca6-75ee97076163,CMCSA,2023-06-12,Comcast Business Partners With Uchiwa Ramen Restaurant to Deliver an Elevated Dining Experience,News Direct,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-business-partners-uchiwa-ramen-070000286.html,1686553200,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Technology solutions deployed at the restaurant’s two locations provide a strong network for meeting customer needsSan Rafael, California --News Direct-- Comcast CaliforniaComcast Business today announced that it is providing Uchiwa Ramen Restaurant (Uchiwa Ramen) with internet and cellular backup solutions at both of the business’ locations. The combination of these two solutions creates a reliable technology network that helps to simplify the management of overall operations as well as employees’ daily tasks, ultimately contributing to a more seamless customer experience when dining.With Comcast Business Internet and Connection Pro, Uchiwa Ramen co-owner Kevin Fong and his team can manage operations at restaurants located in San Rafael and Emeryville with the confidence that their technology will help keep things running smoothly. To keep orders coming in, and customers happy, it is critical that the Uchiwa Ramen team has a strong internet connection – the business’ point of sale (POS) system relies on its network to process dine-in and take-out orders, and Fong regularly receives important documents from his vendors over email. With Comcast Business Internet and Connection Pro, not only does Uchiwa Ramen have a reliable, fast internet connection, they also have the backup solution in place to help the network stay up and running in the face of outages.Fong is dedicated to ensuring that the food, customer service and staffing of Uchiwa Ramen remains consistent across his two locations, which is why choosing an affordable, reliable technology provider was such an important commitment.“With two different locations, in two completely different markets, it has been a relief to have a technology network from Comcast Business,” said Kevin Fong, co-founder of Uchiwa Ramen. “When it comes to reliability, service and bandwidth, Comcast Business has been a reliable partner to work with. It was a no-brainer to work with them.”Story continuesWhen Uchiwa Ramen opened its first location in San Rafael in 2014, there were no other dedicated ramen restaurants in the county. As restaurant guests increasingly sought out more healthier food options, Fong and his team delivered with their take on traditional ramen dishes as well as Asian fusion food – both of which use all-natural ingredients and are low in fat. Following the success of the first location, Fong opened a second store at a mall in Emeryville. With this second location, he hopes to continue to raise awareness for Asian cuisine, and experiment with all-new fusion dishes.“Restaurants like Uchiwa Ramen are the lifeblood of our communities, bringing variety and vitality to our local storefronts and introducing us to delicious, unique dishes that we may not have ever tried on our own,” said Jacob Mitchell, vice president of sales and marketing for Comcast’s California Region. “We are proud to provide Uchiwa Ramen with these technology solutions, as they support such a trailblazing business that not only serves great food, but is dedicated to educating the public on the food and its origin.”About Comcast BusinessComcast Business offers a suite of Connectivity, Communications, Networking, Cybersecurity, Wireless, and Managed Solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

107,bd7c345e-732d-3d48-8af6-4f7a135616ea,PX,2023-06-12,"If EPS Growth Is Important To You, P10 (NYSE:PX) Presents An Opportunity",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eps-growth-important-p10-nyse-104541803.html,1686566741,STORY,['PX'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like P10 (NYSE:PX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide P10 with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for P10 How Fast Is P10 Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. P10 managed to grow EPS by 8.6% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. On the revenue front, P10 has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 32% to US$212m but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for P10's future profits.Story continuesAre P10 Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's a necessity that company leaders act in the best interest of shareholders and so insider investment always comes as a reassurance to the market. So it is good to see that P10 insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$395m. That equates to 30% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like P10 with market caps between US$1.0b and US$3.2b is about US$5.2m.The CEO of P10 only received US$1.2m in total compensation for the year ending December 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is P10 Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, P10 is a growing business, which is encouraging. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for P10, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with P10 , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

The S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq, this marked the seventh consecutive winning week.Throughout the week, speculations surrounding the upcoming FOMC meeting dominated the movement in the stock market, with investors hedging their bets on whether the central bank would continue with its rate hikes. Trade was choppy as many financial analysts suspect that the artificial intelligence-led tech recovery has formed a bubble.With mixed economic numbers and a resilient labor market, opinion remains divided on whether a rate pause will be announced at the June Fed meeting. All eyes are set this week on what Fed officials have to say at the conclusion of the June 13-14 meeting.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

ADMA, which was also upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 on March 28, has returned 15.1% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 8.5% increase) since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Story continuesA hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks has returned 9.7% this year (through March 6) versus 5.4% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Check Universal Stainless’ historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check ADMA’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives VirTra and Iterum HigherShares of VirTra, Inc.

However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform.

Three criteria come to mind when it comes to blue-chip stocks.First, they’re part of the S&amp;P 500. However, that doesn’t mean they’re blue-chip stocks. For example, the company in the index with the smallest market capitalization is Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) at $3.44 billion. It might be a decent-sized company, but it hasn’t been blue-chip for over a decade.The second criterion is that they pay a dividend. Again, they don’t have to be a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrats club, but they should be growing their payout.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLastly, their long-term debt should be insignificant. For me, that’s less than 10% of the market cap. In addition, it would be nice if they had more than $100 million in free cash flow to invest in the business.So, who are these best blue chips poised for growth? Well, for starters, they’re stocks from three different sectors. Secondly, at least one of them won’t be a mega-cap and will have a market cap of less than $25 billion.Fastenal (FAST)Source: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.comI’ve been a Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) fan for years. Recently, I included FAST in a group of seven stocks to own in February 2021. The first time I wrote about the industrial distributor was in March 2012.I was thumbs down on the stock suggesting it was overpriced at 25x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Today, its EV/EBITDA is 18.69x, less than its five-year average.So, suppose you buy Fastenal at current prices. In that case, you’re getting shares in a company with a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $767.2 million [cash flow], total debt of $648.1 million, or 2.1% of its $30.8 billion market cap, and generating a 2.6% dividend yield.Year-to-date, Fastenal’s stock’s up nearly 14%, 431 basis points higher than the index. So over the past five years, it’s almost doubled the index’s performance.Story continuesAs businesses go, you can’t get much more blue-chip than Fastenal.Robert Half International (RHI)The Robert Half International (RHI) logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comRobert Half International (NYSE:RHI) was one of the first human resource consulting firms. It started in 1948 when Bob Half looked to connect job seekers with companies with open positions.The company got a new executive officer on May 17 when it announced Joseph Tarantino as an executive officer of Robert Half. Tarantino has been CEO of its Protiviti division since 2007. It now generates close to $2 billion in annual revenue and accounts for nearly 30% of the company’s overall revenue.In late April, it released its first-quarter results. Revenues were $1.72 billion, 5.4% lower than Q1 2022. On the bottom line, it earned $122.0 million, 27.5% less than a year earlier. The big winner in the quarter was Protiviti, whose revenues grew 4.6% to $494.1 million.“Protiviti led the way with its 22nd consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Talent solutions performed well against a backdrop of client hiring caution and tight labor markets,” stated CEO Keith Waddell.Robert Half’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $624.6 million [key ratios]; it has no debt and a 3.0% dividend yield. Philip Morris International (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris International (NYSE:PM) stock has underperformed in 2023, down more than 11% YTD. However, when it yields more than 5.6%, capital appreciation isn’t nearly as necessary for a successful investment.Philip Morris CEO Jacek Olczak told the Financial Times that he sees the company becoming an ESG stock ESG stock very soon. That’s because its smokeless vape products now account for a third of the company’s revenue, and more analysts are sniffing around.“I’m not saying that they are building a position in Philip Morris … but the asset managers will not spend the time on talking with you if they don’t have in mind that one day is coming that they should reconsider the exclusion [policy],” Olczak told FT in an interview, CNN Business reported.The CEO argues that the world needs to push to eliminate cigarettes by making healthier alternatives — especially those made by Philip Morris — easily accessible to consumers.While earnings were down in the first quarter — $2.0 billion compared to $2.33 billion a year earlier – they were still more than 10% of its revenue.Get paid to wait for its next leg up.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:UPS) Looks Like A Quality Company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-united-parcel-inc-nyse-120038640.html,1686571238,STORY,['UPS'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:54% = US$11b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.54 in profit.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, United Parcel Service has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service's Debt And Its 54% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by United Parcel Service, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.09. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy.

Russia says the invasion is a ""special operation"".Nordic companies said their decision stop selling Mondelez products was based on an announcement this year by Ukraine's National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption to blacklist the snack maker and other groups.Coop Norge, Norway's second biggest food retailer, said on Saturday that it would seek advice from the Norwegian government before making any decisions.Chicago-based Mondelez in a statement said it did not sell Russian-made products in Norway and that official guidelines should be based on objective criteria that treat companies equally.Mondelez said it maintained ""limited"" activity in Russia while halting investment and advertising, and had condemned the war.""Mondelez International complies with all political decisions and sanctions and will continue to consider necessary adjustments to operations in order to ensure full compliance,"" it added.(Reporting by Terje Solsvik.

The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the third quarter 2023.Roots is a leading provider of low-pressure compression and vacuum technologies. As part of the transaction, Ingersoll Rand will assume ownership of the Connersville, Indiana (USA) manufacturing facility, which is dedicated to Roots products, as well as retain approximately 300 team members.“We are excited to have executed a definitive agreement in the second quarter 2023 to sell Roots, which is another key step in accelerating our deleveraging plan while simultaneously allowing us to focus on our core strategic solution offering and integration efforts,” stated Jill Evanko, Chart’s CEO and President. “We also are thrilled that the business will be owned by Ingersoll Rand, a proven strategic partner and a company that will care for the Roots’ team members.”“We have long admired Roots and are thrilled to add this iconic brand to our portfolio.

Essentially, the latest employment readout suggested that more money chases after fewer goods. On the surface, that’s inflationary, not deflationary as a equities sector crash would imply. Still, the devil may be in the details.At the most basic level, a hot jobs figure represented exactly what the Federal Reserve didn’t want to hear. Sure, it may decide to pause its interest rate hike campaign regardless. However, if circumstances continue to accelerate like they have, the Fed may have little choice but to go aggressively hawkish. Of course, such a policy would risk a deflationary outcome, which may incentivize secure stocks during market crash.Finally, the jobs report wasn’t completely good news, which printed fewer hours worked per week and hourly wage growth dipping. Combined with consumers spending less, a downturn isn’t out of the question. Below are ideas to consider for safe investments during market volatility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$184.93DLTRDollar Tree$130.24SRESempra$145.01PGRProgressive Corp.$129.03AAPAdvance Auto Parts$65.59CVRChicago Rivet &amp; Machine$23.98TNDMTandem Diabetes Care$24.25Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comLabeled as a leading high-growth value retailer offering trend-right, high-quality products for tweens, teens and beyond, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) arguably cuts a nice niche in the discount retailer space. Featuring mostly products that are priced up to $5, a select few items range between $6 to $25. Therefore, the company tends to also attract customers seeking bargains as a hobby as opposed to out of desperation.Since the start of the year, FIVE gained over 6% of its equity value. Financially, Five Below delivered overall solid results for its fiscal first quarter of 2023. Although its revenue haul of $726.25 million missed the consensus target by $1.96 million, comparable sales increased by 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. Importantly, management delivered a strong Q2 sales outlook of between $755 million to $765 million.Story continuesHowever, on the fundamental side, consumers haven’t quite started trading down from premium-level retailers en masse, meaning that investors will need to exercise patience with FIVE. Still, it may be one of the stocks to buy before crash because of burgeoning relevancies. Finally, analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $219.13, implying 20% upside potential.Dollar Tree (DLTR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Admittedly ranking as one of the more disappointing stocks to buy before crash, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) should make sense as a mitigatory idea. After all, should the economy fade, consumers will almost invariably tighten their belts. Of course, this dynamic yields a deflationary impact on the discretionary retail space. In addition, people will naturally trade down to cheaper alternatives of commonly purchased goods.On paper, this dynamic benefits DLTR, theoretically making it one of the secure stocks during market crash. Unfortunately, it’s DLTR that’s doing most of the crashing. In the trailing one-month period, the security stumbled more than 12%. So far this year, Dollar Tree stock lost almost 5% of its market value.Part of the problem is that consumers are shifting away from discretionary items to consumable goods. This product category features lower margins, applying pressure on entities like Dollar Tree. At the same time, a broader slowdown could spark significant desperation.

Essentially, the latest employment readout suggested that more money chases after fewer goods. On the surface, that’s inflationary, not deflationary as a equities sector crash would imply. Still, the devil may be in the details.At the most basic level, a hot jobs figure represented exactly what the Federal Reserve didn’t want to hear. Sure, it may decide to pause its interest rate hike campaign regardless. However, if circumstances continue to accelerate like they have, the Fed may have little choice but to go aggressively hawkish. Of course, such a policy would risk a deflationary outcome, which may incentivize secure stocks during market crash.Finally, the jobs report wasn’t completely good news, which printed fewer hours worked per week and hourly wage growth dipping. Combined with consumers spending less, a downturn isn’t out of the question. Below are ideas to consider for safe investments during market volatility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$184.93DLTRDollar Tree$130.24SRESempra$145.01PGRProgressive Corp.$129.03AAPAdvance Auto Parts$65.59CVRChicago Rivet &amp; Machine$23.98TNDMTandem Diabetes Care$24.25Five Below (FIVE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comLabeled as a leading high-growth value retailer offering trend-right, high-quality products for tweens, teens and beyond, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) arguably cuts a nice niche in the discount retailer space. Featuring mostly products that are priced up to $5, a select few items range between $6 to $25. Therefore, the company tends to also attract customers seeking bargains as a hobby as opposed to out of desperation.Since the start of the year, FIVE gained over 6% of its equity value. Financially, Five Below delivered overall solid results for its fiscal first quarter of 2023. Although its revenue haul of $726.25 million missed the consensus target by $1.96 million, comparable sales increased by 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. Importantly, management delivered a strong Q2 sales outlook of between $755 million to $765 million.Story continuesHowever, on the fundamental side, consumers haven’t quite started trading down from premium-level retailers en masse, meaning that investors will need to exercise patience with FIVE. Still, it may be one of the stocks to buy before crash because of burgeoning relevancies. Finally, analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $219.13, implying 20% upside potential.Dollar Tree (DLTR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Admittedly ranking as one of the more disappointing stocks to buy before crash, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) should make sense as a mitigatory idea. After all, should the economy fade, consumers will almost invariably tighten their belts. Of course, this dynamic yields a deflationary impact on the discretionary retail space. In addition, people will naturally trade down to cheaper alternatives of commonly purchased goods.On paper, this dynamic benefits DLTR, theoretically making it one of the secure stocks during market crash. Unfortunately, it’s DLTR that’s doing most of the crashing. In the trailing one-month period, the security stumbled more than 12%. So far this year, Dollar Tree stock lost almost 5% of its market value.Part of the problem is that consumers are shifting away from discretionary items to consumable goods. This product category features lower margins, applying pressure on entities like Dollar Tree. At the same time, a broader slowdown could spark significant desperation. For the patient, DLTR could be one of the stocks resistant to market crash.For now, analysts peg DLTR as a consensus moderate buy.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Valero Energy's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:52% = US$14b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.52 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 52% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Valero Energy has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 32% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Valero Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 27% was to be expected.As a next step, we compared Valero Energy's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 22% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for VLO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Valero Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Valero Energy's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 13%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 87% of its profits. So it looks like Valero Energy is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, Valero Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 43% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 15% over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Valero Energy's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

126,b4fea4ba-c579-3472-8c31-66c9ef75b4cf,UNH,2023-06-12,Here's What We Like About UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-unitedhealth-groups-nyse-unh-123536989.html,1686486936,STORY,['UNH'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, UnitedHealth Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.88 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$6.60 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, UnitedHealth Group stock has a trailing yield of around 1.3% on the current share price of $493.62. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether UnitedHealth Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately UnitedHealth Group's payout ratio is modest, at just 30% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 18% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that UnitedHealth Group's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share have been growing at 15% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. UnitedHealth Group has delivered 23% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineShould investors buy UnitedHealth Group for the upcoming dividend? UnitedHealth Group has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in UnitedHealth Group for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

127,ceaa72fd-bbb8-3473-abea-1a5345676b80,LKQ,2023-06-12,Returns At LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) Are On The Way Up,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-lkq-nasdaq-lkq-way-111506115.html,1686568506,STORY,['LKQ'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in LKQ's (NASDAQ:LKQ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for LKQ, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$13b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, LKQ has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Retail Distributors industry average of 17%. Check out our latest analysis for LKQ roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for LKQ compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for LKQ.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThe trends we've noticed at LKQ are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 14%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 24%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at LKQ thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.What We Can Learn From LKQ's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that LKQ is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with a respectable 70% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if LKQ can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for LKQ  that we think you should be aware of.While LKQ isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Procter &amp; Gamble's (NYSE:PG) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Procter &amp; Gamble, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$19b ÷ (US$120b - US$38b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 23%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Procter &amp; Gamble compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Procter &amp; Gamble.The Trend Of ROCEProcter &amp; Gamble is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 47% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To bring it all together, Procter &amp; Gamble has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Procter &amp; Gamble, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

130,d7c076e7-746c-3371-bb66-3330e77f6f84,DHI,2023-06-12,Investing in D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) five years ago would have delivered you a 188% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-d-r-horton-nyse-120029154.html,1686571229,STORY,['DHI'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 172% in five years. On top of that, the share price is up 17% in about a quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, D.R. Horton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 38% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 22% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 7.51 also suggests market apprehension.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how D.R. Horton has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling D.R. Horton stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, D.R. Horton's TSR for the last 5 years was 188%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that D.R. Horton has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 73% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 24% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.
