4,e9bea31f-89a6-35b9-b77c-fb1ecc1dab89,TXN,2023-07-11,Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-incorporateds-nasdaq-txn-110110235.html,1689073270,STORY,['TXN'],"[Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 5.2% over the last month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Texas Instruments'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:54% = US$8.3b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.54 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 54% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Texas Instruments has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 16% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Texas Instruments was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then compared Texas Instruments' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 35% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is TXN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TXN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Texas Instruments Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%) for Texas Instruments suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Texas Instruments is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 65% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 43%) over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like Texas Instruments has some positive aspects to its business. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom AVGO, Avnet AVT, Texas Instruments TXN and Corning GLW.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Dividend-Paying Stocks to Watch Amid Uncertain TimesTech stocks have made a remarkable comeback in the first half of 2023 after a massive sell-off in 2022 on recession concerns, inflationary pressure, increased oil prices and higher interest rates. With a year-to-date (YTD) rise of 30.7%, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has outperformed The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 index's increase of 2.3% and 14.9%, respectively.Technology stocks have more than 50% of weightage in the Nasdaq Composite index. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the most important component of the broad market index, has returned 38.2% YTD.However, with persistent inflationary pressure and softening demand, the fears of recession have not subsided yet. Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.This may negatively impact the overall financial performances of tech companies. Therefore, we believe that investing in high-quality dividend-paying tech stocks like — Broadcom, Avnet, Texas Instruments and Corning — amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might fetch handsome returns.A stock with a history of increasing dividends is considered healthy and offers a capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of stock market movements. Dividend growth stocks generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and offer downside protection, with a consistent increase in payouts.Story continuesHow to Identify Stocks?We ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify stocks that have a dividend yield of more than 2%, with five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%. Furthermore, we have narrowed down our search by considering stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's discuss the abovementioned tech stocks in detail:Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V-based products.Broadcom is benefiting from the strong demand for its networking solutions, PON fiber and cable modems. The strong adoption of Broadcom's server storage solutions by hyperscalers, acceleration in 5G deployment, production ramp-up and an increase in radio frequency content are driving top-line growth.The company is also benefiting from the strong deployment of generative AI by hyperscalers, service providers and enterprises. Additionally, the robust adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E for access gateways due to solid demand from homes, enterprises, telcos and other service providers is expected to continue driving revenue growth in the broadband end market.The stock has a dividend yield of 2.1% and five-year historical dividend growth of 20.4%. Further, AVGO's payout ratio is 48% of earnings at present. Check Broadcom's dividend history here.Avnet is one of the world's largest distributors of electronic components and computer products. The company's customer base includes original equipment manufacturers, electronic manufacturing services providers, original design manufacturers and value-added resellers. Avnet maintains an extensive inventory, including electronic products from more than 300 component and system manufacturers, which it distributes to customers worldwide.Avnet is benefiting from the robust demand for its products in the communication and defense market. Strong growth across all markets is an upside. Its continued focus on boosting the Internet of Things capabilities is helping it expand in newer markets and gain customers.Avnet's expanding partner base and acquisitions are likely to boost top-line growth.

We'll also discuss which sector consumes the most steel and what are the projections for the metal's usage in the future. If you want to skip the details, read Top 8 Steel Companies In World.11 out of the top 20 steel companies in the world are from China, showing the country's monopoly in the global steel sector. Other major steel companies are from Luxembourg, Japan, South Korea, India, and the United States.The biggest Chinese steel producing companies are China Baowu Group, Ansteel Group, and Shagang Group, among others. Aside from the top companies in China, ArcelorMittal S.A. (NYSE:MT) is the largest steel producing company in Europe (and the 2nd largest worldwide). In 2022 alone, ArcelorMittal S.A. (NYSE:MT) had a steel tonnage production of over 68 million metric tons, slightly down from the company's yield of 79.26 million metric tons in 2021. Owing to its production mills spread in Europe, Brazil, and Mexico, the company's revenue of crude steel reached $79.8 billion in 2022. The biggest steel producing company in the US is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), based in Charlotte. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is also the biggest scrap recycler in North America and the main mini-mill steelmaker in the country. In 2022, steel tonnage of Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) exceeded 20 million metric tons, and the company has announced a new $100 million electric arc furnace melt shop at its Arizona bar mill that will have to produce over 0.6 million metric tons annually. In Asia, South Korea's POSCO Holdings Inc (NYSE:PKX) is at the top, along with Japan's Nippon Steel Corporation.

The company was formed in 2016 through the merger of Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and has incredible production capacities. As per World Steel Association data from 2022, Baowu's annual crude steel output reached an impressive 131.84 million metric tons, representing a significant proportion of the global steel production, which stood at approximately 1.87 billion metric tons.Post-Pandemic Changes in the Global Steel SectorThe World Steel Association reported a global downturn in finished steel consumption by 2.3% in 2022. The decrease came in the wake of the escalating conflict in Ukraine, COVID-19 containment measures in China, global inflation, and a worldwide surge in energy prices that took a toll on the metal mining sector. Conversely, the United States exhibited a contrasting trend as the country's estimated consumption of finished steel products increased by 2% over the same year. According to USGS, the resurgence resulted from the economic recovery that stemmed from the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic.Another important factor that influenced global steel production was the economic climate in China. In 2022, Chinese finished steel production fell by 4%, a trend projected to persist into 2023. The static state can be traced back to the continuation of COVID-19 mitigation policies that induced a slump in demand for real estate and construction investments. Further east, Japan and South Korea also witnessed a decline in steel demand in 2022, primarily associated with reduced activity within the construction industry.However, in the same period, India saw a notable uptick in the production of finished steel products, with an expected rise of around 6%, according to USGS. Substantial infrastructure expenditures, rising consumer goods demand, and a resurgence in the automotive sector are the drivers behind this growth. Which Sector Is The Biggest Consumer Of Steel?According to the World Steel Organization, the prevailing demand for steel in the housing and construction sector accounts for over 50% of the world's steel consumption. Comprising residential and non-residential structures such as bridges, highways, and tunnels, this sector is pivotal in the constant expansion of global urban landscapes. Data also indicates that per capita steel use has escalated from 150 kilograms in 2001 to approximately 230 kilograms in 2020.Also, reports predict a continuous uptick in steel consumption and say there is expected to be a 20% surge in global steel usage by 2050. The forecasted growth will stem from population growth, urbanization trends, and economic development, especially in emerging economies with extensive infrastructure development. Which Is The Largest Producer of Steel in the World?China is the largest producer of steel in the world and accounted for approximately half of the world's output in 2022. Data from the World Steel Association reveals that in 2022, China manufactured about 1.013 billion metric tons of crude steel.The government's policies promoting self-sufficiency in metal mining have encouraged the growth of domestic steel industries, such as Baowu Steel Group and HBIS Group, among others, that reinforce China's leading position in global steel production. We have already done a detailed overview of the 15 Largest Steel Producing Countries in the World; give this insightful article a read to know which countries are the largest steel producers. Top 20 Steel Companies In The WorldTop 20 Steel Companies In The WorldOur Methodology We ranked the top 20 largest steel producing companies in the world according to their steel production tonnage in 2022.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the real estate market, check out the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The real estate sector stands as a highly profitable industry globally, with its significance further emphasized by the interdependence between real estate development and some of the world's largest economies. Naturally, this also means that the industry is closely monitored by both governments and the wealthy. Encompassing various intricate facets, including the acquisition, sale, and administration of diverse properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces, the real estate industry involves a multitude of participants, ranging from real estate agents and brokers to property developers, landlords, property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions.According to a report, the global real estate industry was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021. Despite its substantial size, the segment is projected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030, reaching an estimated worth of $5.85 trillion by the conclusion of the forecast period. In addition to the residential sector, the commercial real estate (CRE) market constitutes a significant portion of the industry. More specifically, commercial real estate outperformed inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods and outperformed its own historical average in five of them. After enduring losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, returns in the CRE sector have experienced a partial recovery, accompanied by the resurgence of inflation. It is expected to mirror the overall growth rate of the sector, with a projected CAGR of 5.1% throughout the forecast period. Additionally, McKinsey states that commercial real estate returns have demonstrated strong performance over the seven inflationary periods spanning from 1980 to 2022, achieving an annualized rate of 11.7%. Notably, they have consistently outperformed inflation, and even outshined other asset classes such as the S&amp;P 500 and BBB corporate bonds.Story continuesHowever, all is not well in the CRE market. According to Bloomberg, the top US bank regulators are asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress in the commercial real estate market. With the sharp increase in borrowing costs, property owners are facing immense pressure, leading to defaults on debt by companies such as Brookfield Corporation. The situation is particularly challenging for office owners, as elevated borrowing costs make financing more difficult, and tenants are scaling back due to layoffs and the growing trend of remote work. According to the latest guidance, banks are advised to offer short-term loan accommodations to borrowers. These accommodations may involve deferring payments, accepting partial payments, or providing other forms of assistance. In this environment, lenders are now faced with challenging negotiations as approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate loans are due this year and next. Following this, major institutional owners including Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Brookfield and Pimco have already chosen to stop payments on some buildings, stating that they have ""better uses for their cash and resources"".The real estate industry is currently engaged in a significant debate regarding the future occupancy of vacant office buildings in various cities. As an example, cities such as San Francisco and Chicago are experiencing office vacancy rates approaching 25%. This has resulted in a decline of 50% in office real estate stocks compared to pre-Covid levels, while the REIT sector has experienced a 9.5% loss in the past year, in contrast to the S&amp;P 500's 14.5% gain. However, it's important to note that offices now represent only 3.4% of the $1 trillion public market for real estate investment trusts (REITs), and the broader REIT space is not facing the same level of challenges.On the other hand, the residential real estate (RRE) market seems to be faring somewhat better. Following a significant decline in new home prices, which dropped by 10% from their highest levels reached in February 2023, the prices are on an upward trend with the latest reading of April 2023. Furthermore, the regional housing index provided by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo contributes to this positive trend. The most recent reading for June indicates a sixth consecutive month of growth, with the index standing at 55.

Most notably, investors looking to delve into the real estate market should be prepared for the ways online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology will impact all aspects of real estate transactions. Based on a report, investors can anticipate an increase in competition among property listing websites in the near future, all striving to facilitate seamless buying and selling experiences for aspiring and current property owners. While platforms such as Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long held a dominant position in the market, new and similar platforms will continue to emerge, further intensifying the competition. Technology will seemingly play a substantial role in the future of the real estate market, and major players will learn to maneuver the market accordingly, or they risk lagging behind the competition, of which there is plenty.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best commercial real estate stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc.

10,23d8ec7f-65e8-3949-9a34-5a8b243fa3ce,STT,2023-07-11,"Fee Income to Aid State Street (STT) Q2 Earnings, NIR to Hurt",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fee-income-aid-state-street-124300096.html,1688992980,STORY,['STT'],"[State Street STT is scheduled to announce second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 14 before market open. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, STT’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were largely hurt by a rise in expenses, higher provisions and a fall in fee revenues. Lower asset balances also affected the results. However, an increase in net interest revenues (NIR) and growth in the net interest margin (NIM) aided results to some extent.State Street has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 2.31%, on average.State Street Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation price-eps-surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for State Street’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.10 per share. The consensus estimate has been revised almost 1% upward over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a rise of 8.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings stands at $2.04, implying a 5% rise.The consensus estimate of $3.13 billion for sales suggests a 6% year-over-year rise. Our estimate for sales is pegged at $3.1 billion, calling for an increase of 5%.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Net Interest Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $231.4 billion, which implies a fall of 2.6% from the previous quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $233.2 billion.Lending activities continued at a slower pace in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve increased rates by 25 basis points in May and then kept the rates unchanged at 5-5.25% during the June FOMC meeting. These factors are expected to have supported State Street’s NIR during the quarter. However, an increase in funding costs weighed on NIR as interest rates continued to remain high. Thus, NIR is likely to have been adversely impacted to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIR (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $701.4 million indicates a sequential decline of 8.7%. We project NIR on FTE basis of $690.9 million.Management projects NII to decrease 5-10% sequentially on non-interest-bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as monetary tightening and interest rate hikes continue.Fee Revenues: Lower volatility in foreign exchange (FX) markets is likely to have aided State Street’s FX trading services income. The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at $341.3 million, relatively stable from the prior-quarter level. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $359.2 million.The consensus estimate for securities finance revenues of $117.5 million suggests a 7.8% rise from the last quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for software and processing fees calls for a 22.4% improvement. Management projects software and processing fees to increase substantially based on the number of on-premise renewals and SaaS conversions during the quarter.The consensus estimate for servicing fees of $1.24 billion indicates a 2.2% sequential rise, while the consensus estimate for management fees of $461.3 million implies almost 1% growth. The company expects servicing fees to be up 1-2% and management fees to be flat to up 1% quarter over quarter. Our estimates for servicing fees and management fees are pegged at $1.23 billion and $457.2 million, respectively.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fee revenues of $2.43 billion indicates a 4.1% increase from the previous quarter’s reported figure. We project the metric to be the same as the consensus estimate.Management expects fee revenues to be up 4-4.5% on a sequential basis.Expenses: Higher information systems and communication expenses, inflationary pressure and the company’s strategic buyouts and investments in franchises are expected to have led to a rise in operating expenses in the second quarter.Management expects adjusted expenses to be flat on a sequential basis, excluding $181 million of seasonal compensation costs incurred in the first quarter.We anticipate total non-interest expenses to increase 4.5% to $2.2 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model RevealsPer our proven model, the chances of an earnings beat for State Street this time are low.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 23% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 3.6%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Qorvo While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last half decade, Qorvo became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Qorvo's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveQorvo provided a TSR of 3.6% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 4% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

18,27f832f2-c9ab-3ec5-9146-6fa20c4b05a4,WMT,2023-07-11,Can Rite Aid (RAD) Stock Bounce Back on Growth Endeavors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rite-aid-rad-stock-bounce-145000274.html,1689000600,STORY,"['RAD', 'WMT', 'ANF']","[Rite Aid Corporation RAD has been witnessing underperformance in front-end sales in the Retail Pharmacy Segment and a higher-than-expected medical loss ratio at Elixir Insurance. Also, reduced transactions in its stores due to drab demand for respiratory-related products, inventory issues and inefficient pricing act as deterrents.This led to a sluggish year-over-year performance in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The adjusted loss of 73 cents per share was wider than the prior-year quarter’s loss of 60 cents. Revenues declined 6% from the year-ago quarter to $5,356.2 million due to the reduction in the company’s Prescription Drug Plan membership and the loss of commercial clients at Elixir, partly offset by increased Retail Pharmacy segment revenues stemming from higher pharmacy sales.For fiscal 2024, management expects revenues of $22.6-$23.0 billion, suggesting a decline from the $24 billion reported in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA is envisioned to be $330-$360 million, indicating a rise from last year’s reported figure of $429.2 million. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of RAD have lost 35.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 12%.Efforts to Counter HurdlesRite Aid has long been benefiting from the expansion of delivery services to its customers. Some notable efforts in this space include home delivery service to customers with an eligible prescription with the benefit of zero delivery fees; pickup and drive-through services for prescriptions and over-the-counter products at its stores; and the Buy Online Pickup In Store initiative.Continued strength in on-demand delivery, third-party marketplaces, and buy online, pick up at store options has been upsides. Earlier, management expanded Uber Eats, Postmates and Instacart delivery services. It also made partnerships with Amazon and Instacart for home delivery; DoorDash to offer same-day delivery of non-prescription health, convenience and wellness essentials; ScriptDrop to expedite the prescription delivery process; and Shipt to provide same-day delivery of health and wellness products to Rite Aid’s retail footprint across 17 states. In a recent development, Rite Aid collaborated with Afterpay to offer the service of shop online and pay later. Also, Rite Aid launched its loyalty program, Rite Aid Rewards, to expand its customer base to improve customer engagement in pharmacy and front-end sales.RAD collaborated with Grubhub to deliver the former's drugstore products to customers in more than 2000 locations across 16 states with the benefit of zero delivery fees on orders of $12 or above. Rite Aid also partnered with Quest Diagnostics, which commercializes PCR tests, with which RAD has been able to expand the PCR test offering to all stores.As part of its corporate strategy and growth plan, Rite Aid is focused on strengthening its foothold in mid-market PBM, innovation across its retail and mail-order pharmacy channels, enhancing in-store experience by curated digital offerings, improved merchandises, and rebranding its image with a new logo. RAD earlier launched its first three Stores of the Future and concluded the acquisition of Bartell, which will help expand its customer base.Rite Aid earlier revealed plans to lower costs via the closures of 145 unprofitable stores, reduced corporate administrative expenses and enhanced efficiencies in worked payroll, and other store labor costs. These cost initiatives and store closures generated $5 million in savings in the fiscal first quarter.Coming to Elixir Insurance, it achieved 275,000 life memberships in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Notably, Rite Aid announced the exit of the individual Part D market beginning in January 2024. Post this, Elixir will remain in the group Medicare Part D market and continue to offer employer group waiver plans across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Continued investments and stringent cost management bode well. Going forward, it is focused on increasing its market presence, growing the Elixir membership and establishing the Elixir Insurance Part D business.Earlier, Rite Aid renewed its largest Medicare Advantage client and has won a number of Medicare Advantage health plans for 2023. In another development, RAD launched 546 products. It has also been on track to open small-format pharmacies in underserved rural markets such as Indiana, upstate New York and Virginia. Notably, it opened a Rite Aid Pharmacy in Grottoes, VA, marking the company's fourth store in rural Virginia. Prior to this, the company opened Rite Aid Pharmacy stores in Craigsville, Greenville and Scottsville, VA.Rite Aid’s Retail Pharmacy segment has long been a key growth driver. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the segment’s revenues rose 3.4%, driven by increased acute and maintenance prescriptions, somewhat offset by reduced COVID-19 vaccine and testing revenues, and store closures.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales moved up 8.4%, driven by a 13.3% rise in pharmacy sales, somewhat offset by a 4.4% decline in front-end same-store sales. Prescription count at same-store sales, adjusted to 30-day-equivalent, rose 4.7% on the back of non-COVID-19 prescriptions (up 7.4%), acute prescriptions (up 6.8%) and maintenance prescriptions (up 7.6%). Prescription sales constituted 73.9% of overall drugstore sales. For fiscal 2024, the Retail Pharmacy segment’s revenues are anticipated to be $18-$18.3 billion.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that expanded delivery services, increased non-COVID prescriptions, and cost-saving initiatives will likely offset demand woes and aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term. Also, a Momentum Score of B bodes well.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, Urban Outfitters URBN and Walmart WMT.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women, and kids, currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This would be the lowest reading since March 2021. The core rate is expected to have dropped for a third month to 5% from 5.3%, but this is still more than double the Fed's 2% target.Last week's employment report showed far fewer workers than expected had been added to non-farm payrolls last month, which unleashed a wave of selling of the U.S. dollar, but did little to shift the needle in terms of rate expectations.""(Market) movements, especially between the jobs report and inflation when they're so close together, I take with a relative pinch of salt,"" OANDA market strategist Craig Erlam said.""There is a massive eye on tomorrow's inflation data - it comes to late in the day for the July meeting. That hike is basically sealed and it would take something pretty weak on the inflation side to change that,"" he said.FLAGGING DOLLARThe dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, was last down 0.1% on the day and around its lowest in two months, in line with a retreat in U.S. Treasury yields.Story continuesThe yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 4 basis points at 3.966%, having broken below 4% the day before.""While there is increasing evidence of near-term disinflationary trends, questions remain as to whether inflation will persist at uncomfortably high levels in the medium-term,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.The Japanese yen rose to one-month highs against the dollar, leaving the U.S. currency down 0.7% on the day at 140.34, tracking the drop in Treasury yields.Meanwhile, the prospect of a boost to the broader Chinese economy helped push up the price of crude oil and other industrial commodities such as copper and iron ore.Chinese regulators on Monday extended some policies in a rescue package introduced in November to shore up liquidity in the embattled real estate sector.Brent crude, which has struggled to pull clear of 18-month lows, was up 0.5% at $78.15 a barrel, while U.S. futures rose 0.7% to $73.46.Copper gained 0.1% on the London Metal Exchange to trade around $8,375 a tonne. The price is heading for its first annual loss since 2018, in large part because of patchy demand from China.Second-quarter earnings come out this week, with results due from some of Wall Street's biggest institutions, including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.Analysts expect earnings to have shrunk 6.4% in the second quarter year-on-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.(Additional reporting by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong; Editing by Jamie Freed, David Evans and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

Higher rates can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the oil market should remain tight in the second half of 2023, citing strong demand from China and developing countries combined with recently announced supply cuts, including by top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia.The IEA will publish new forecasts this week.The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said global energy demand is forecast to rise 23% by the end of 2045.Story continuesRECORD WORLD OIL SUPPLY AND DEMANDThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected global oil output would rise from 99.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 101.1 million bpd in 2023 and 102.6 million bpd in 2024, while world demand will rise from 99.4 million bpd in 2022 to 101.2 million bpd in 2023 and 102.8 million bpd in 2024.That compares with a record 100.5 million bpd of global oil production in 2018 and a record 100.8 million bpd of world liquids consumption in 2019.EIA also projected U.S. crude output would rise from 11.9 million bpd in 2022 to 12.6 million bpd in 2023 and 12.9 million bpd in 2024, while U.S. liquids consumption would rise from 20.3 million bpd in 2022 to 20.4 million bpd in 2023 and 20.8 million bpd in 2024.That compares with a record 12.3 million bpd of U.S. crude production in 2019 and a record 20.8 million bpd of liquids consumption in 2005.The market is awaiting U.S. oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, on Tuesday and the EIA on Wednesday.With analysts in a Reuters poll forecasting a 0.5-million barrel increase in U.S. crude stocks during the week ended July 7, that inventory data could weigh on oil markets.

29,f54718a4-dc98-3a0f-9acc-72ed92dfe4f6,O,2023-07-11,"Big Oil's Radical Proposal: Curtail Consumption, Not Production",Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-oils-radical-proposal-curtail-000000425.html,1689033600,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Last year, in the middle of an energy crunch, European governments called on their citizens to consume less energy. They also lashed out at Big Oil for making billions from the squeeze.Now, Big Oil is the one calling for a reduction in energy consumption. Essentially, supermajors have suggested that people should use less of their products. But they don't want to slash production.The seemingly paradoxical message came out earlier this week from a conference in Vienna, where OPEC leaders met with their Big Oil counterparts from BP, Shell, and other oil companies to discuss the future of global energy.As might have been expected in this day and age, the message to come out of the gathering was that everyone is committed to a net-zero world in the future but that right now, everyone was committed to ensuring there is enough energy for those who need it, regardless of the source.What was, perhaps, less expected was the reported call from Big Oil for governments to focus on demand reduction rather than supply limitation as a means of enabling that net-zero world. OPEC officials, meanwhile, focused on the importance of energy security as they have done before.""We must do everything we can to reduce emissions, not to reduce energy,"" OPEC secretary-general, Haitham al Ghais said, as quoted by Euronews. ""There is a misconception going around about reducing production and reducing investment in oil and gas, we do not agree with that message.""One would assume the reason OPEC disagrees with this message is that it would lead to lower profits for its members. But according to Big Oil, the motive for switching from a focus on supply to one on demand will avoid even higher profits for oil producers. Not that the executives put it quite this way.The report on that call comes from Reuters, which was once again refused access to the conference but quoted sources present there. And that call follows statements made by Big Oil executives that they will slow down with their pivot away from their core business.Story continuesFrom an activist perspective, Big Oil is trying to justify its renewed focus on oil and gas at a time when oil and gas are making record profits. From an energy security perspective, it is difficult to argue that reducing the supply of a commodity while leaving demand unchanged could only have one result: a sharp rise in the price of that commodity.Of course, there is a case to be made that right now, despite stable and growing demand for oil, prices are depressed—but this is because factors different from oil's fundamentals are running the show, as it were. These factors include GDP growth in big consumers, inflation, and central bank monetary policy. But there is also the perception that there is an abundant supply of oil that has contributed to the pressure on prices.So, what Big Oil executives are basically saying is that governments—and activists—have got the wrong end of the stick: they are trying to reduce the supply of oil and gas without addressing demand. And that is an approach that is doomed to failure, as we saw last year when the same governments that berated Big Oil for its profits subsidized the consumption of Big Oil's products to avoid riots on their hands.Meanwhile, at another recent event, other Big Oil executives dared speak a truth that few leaders in the West would even acknowledge in private. That truth amounts to the fact that oil and gas are going nowhere in the next few decades, no matter what green transition plans governments are making.""We think the biggest realization that should come out of this conference ... is oil and gas are needed for decades to come,"" is how Hess Corp.'s John Hess put it. ""Energy transition is going to take a lot longer, it's going to cost a lot more money and need new technologies that don't even exist today.""Naturally, this would be a welcome opportunity for a climate advocate to argue that Big Oil is trying to save its bacon when the world is turning vegan, but even that climate advocate would be hard-pressed to explain why, if the world's moving away from hydrocarbons, China is building coal plants and India is building refineries.The truth is that the world is not moving away from hydrocarbons. Demand for oil has hit 102 million barrels daily. Demand for gas is soaring, too, notably from transition poster continent Europe. U.S. oil consumption is also growing after a drop in 2020—the lockdown year.There may be something, then, in a call for addressing demand for oil and gas instead of calling for less production. But addressing demand with a view to essentially discouraging it will be tricky—and also highly unpopular among voters. Germany is a good example worth studying by other transition-minded countries. It shows that forcing the transition down people's throats does not usually yield the expected results.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Energy Stocks: Q2 Winners And LosersFrom Boom To Gloom: Saudi Arabia’s Economy Dips Due To Voluntary Oil CutsIs Libya The Next Wildcard For Oil Markets?Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

Non-oil economic growth is expected to remain robust this year. But the large share of oil in the export revenues will weigh on the economy and the budget revenues.The Saudi economy is set to shrink by 0.1% in 2023 if the Kingdom unwinds the voluntary cut in September. But if the Saudis continue to push for tightening of the market by keeping the cuts in place by the end of the year, the 2023 economy will shrink by 1%, according to estimates from Bloomberg Economics.To compare, Saudi Arabia was the fastest-growing G20 economy in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said last month, just after OPEC's top producer said it would unilaterally reduce its oil production for July.Last year, ""Overall growth reached 8.7 percent, reflecting both strong oil production and a 4.8 percent non-oil GDP growth driven by robust private consumption and non-oil private investment, including giga projects,"" the IMF said.Story continuesLast year's surplus – fueled by high oil production and high oil prices – allowed the Kingdom to make large investments in its projects of the future aimed at diversifying the economy from oil, including in NEOM, the futuristic flagship project of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The OPEC+ cuts announced in April are expected to reduce Saudi economic growth to 2.1% this year, from 3.1% growth the IMF expected in its May economic projections for the Middle East economies.Back in early May, the IMF said that Saudi Arabia needed oil prices at $80.90 per barrel to balance its budget this year.But that estimate was based on Saudi oil production of 10.5 million bpd and excluded the spending on mega projects. At current oil production levels and the same spending on projects, the Kingdom's breakeven oil price rises to $95 a barrel, Bloomberg Economics has estimated.Lower oil revenues and production have already resulted in slower growth in Saudi Arabia's economy this year.In the first quarter of 2023, Saudi Arabia's economy slowed to growth of 3.8% year-over-year, slightly lower than the preliminary estimate of 3.9%, bank Emirates NBD said in a commentary last month.""On a seasonally adjusted basis, real output contracted -1.4% q/q, largely on the back of declining crude oil and natural gas production,"" the bank noted.Non-oil growth remained strong in Q1, driven by government spending.If the Saudis keep the current cuts through the end of this year, the economy will contract, Khatija Haque, Head of Research &amp; Chief Economist at Emirates NBD said last month.""In this scenario, overall oil production from the kingdom would be almost -9% lower than in 2022, bringing headline GDP growth down to -0.5% even as we expect the non-oil sectors to post robust growth of 4.8%,"" the economist added.The drag on the economy from the production cuts point to still high dependence on oil. When Fitch upgraded Saudi Arabia's rating in April, citing the Kingdom's strong fiscal position and ""formidable"" foreign reserves, it warned that the high oil dependence remains a rating weakness for Saudi Arabia's economy, in addition to weak World Bank governance indicators and vulnerability to geopolitical shocks.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China's Metal Export Restrictions Leave Traders ScramblingArmenian-Azerbaijani Peace Talks Hit A Snag In WashingtonEnergy Stocks: Q2 Winners And LosersRead this article on OilPrice.com]"
31,a6c36f62-7833-3854-a4e4-9784550f5238,O,2023-07-11,DOE/EIA diesel price higher after more bullish trend in oil markets,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doe-eia-diesel-price-higher-215447370.html,1689026087,STORY,['CL=F'],"[The benchmark price used for most fuel surcharges rose for the first time in three weeks and just the third in the last 23. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The diesel price used as the basis for most fuel surcharges reversed course this week, rising 3.9 cents a gallon for the first increase in three weeks and just the third in the past 23 weeks.The Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration price was posted at $3.806 a gallon Monday. The reversal of recent trends came as gains in the broader oil market have been significant and sustained enough that some analysts say the weak market that has been the driving force for most of the first half of the year might have run its course.The Brent market, the world’s crude benchmark, peaked this year with a settlement price of $88.19 a barrel on Jan. 23. After the early April announcement of a cut in production from the OPEC+ group of oil exporters, Brent rose as high as an $87.33-a-barrel settlement on April 12, climbing from prices in the $70s that prevailed for much of the second half of March.But the OPEC+ cuts, even when bolstered by further Saudi cuts in addition to the OPEC+ reductions, did not have staying power in stemming the slide in prices. Brent on the CME commodity exchange settled at $72.26 a barrel on June 27.Since then, in mostly steady gains without any spectacular one-day increases, the price of Brent climbed as high as a $78.47-a-barrel settlement Friday before a decline Monday to $77.69. The Friday settlement was the highest since May 1.The sense that the oil market may have hit a bottom and that fundamental supply and demand was pushing numbers higher was summed up in a statement to Reuters by the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol.According to Reuters, Birol said the IEA still sees the oil market as tight going into the second half of the year.“Even in sluggish economic growth, China and other developing countries’ demand is strong,” he said. “Taken together with the production cuts coming from key producing countries, we still believe that we may see tightness in the market in the second half of this year.”Story continuesThat strength is showing up even stronger in diesel markets. After a recent low settlement of $2.3091 a gallon on June 12, ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) on the CME climbed Friday to a settlement of $2.5591, up exactly 25 cents a gallon from its June 12 low. The price retreated slightly Monday, to $2.5532, down 0.59 cents.More notable recently has been the strength of ULSD against Brent. The front-month comparison has climbed to roughly 70.3 cents a gallon, up from about 60 cents just one week earlier.While physical market diesel spreads in the U.S. are not showing signs of any particular tightness, Bloomberg reported late last week that was not the case in Europe.Citing refinery disruptions in Germany and the Persian Gulf, the news agency quoted Philip Jones-Lux, commodity owner at Sparta Commodities, as saying that the diesel market is being hit by reduced flows out of the Middle East. “[With] some volumes on water only expected to arrive toward the end of July, there is a need to entice more volumes out of storage in the short term,” Bloomberg quoted Jones-Lux as saying.Water levels on the Rhine continue to be a problem in Europe as well, having the potential to  slow diesel deliveries along that waterway, which supplies parts of Germany, France and Switzerland.Quantum Commodities, in an email, said the water level at the important measuring point of Kaub will likely decline to a level below 100 centimeters by the middle of this week, citing German government data. Quantum said that puts water levels at a number not seen since at least 2000.More articles by John KingstonRXO outlook cut to negative but important debt rating not reducedC.H.

Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research at Argus Research, tells Yahoo Finance what is he expecting to hear from banks this quarter.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Tougher capital rules for US banks proposed by the Fed's Barr isn't the only thing that investors are closely watching. Earnings season is just around the corner. And the nation's largest banks are gearing up to report their quarterly results. Here with more on what we can expect, we want to bring in Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research for Argus Research.Stephen, it's good to see you. So certainly, a challenging set up here for the banks, a higher interest rate environment. We have also the possibility here of stricter regulations. And the implications of that is something that investors are waiting to see. How does this set us up for this round of earnings season?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, so, well, I think it's going to be, you know, not banks' finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter. Clearly, the higher rate environment that was very helpful in 2022 for net interest margins is having a detrimental effect now. You've got slowing loan growth, just less demand as you have much higher interest rates here. And that's the intended effect of the Federal Reserve.Net interest margins, it looks like they peaked in the fourth quarter of last year. We're likely to see additional pressure sequentially on margins as deposit rates have really increased quite a bit here as banks try to stay competitive with a lot of higher-yielding alternatives out there. And then, of course, on the other bit of lending, the business would be loss provisions.And, you know, we're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market. So I think banks are going to be conservative here, add to loan loss provisions. And all in all, of course, all three of those will dampen earnings growth a little bit for the quarter.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: So you talk about the growth we're likely to see in loan losses, defaults in credit card payments. But we've heard repeatedly about the potential cliff waiting, especially in commercial real estate. What are you going to be looking for, at least in this quarter, in terms of the potential rising risk on that front for banks?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, definitely, the commercial real estate does, you know, loom as a potential problem area. And we've seen some defaults already kind of pick up there. You know, I think banks did a very good job in the first quarter of laying out the risks there.Typically, for the very large banks, commercial real estate is about 10% of their loan book. Commercial and the office space in particular, which is where a lot of the damage is and the higher delinquency rates, is typically more like, you know, 3% to 4%. It's quite a bit higher, about double that, at the regional bank level, but still, you know, manageable at this point.And of course, the underwriting standards have been better in commercial real estate than they were 5 or 10 or 15 years ago. So that's beneficial for banks. They have generally about a 40-- or 60, I should say, 60% loan to value in there. And, you know, that gives them a fair amount of leeway should these go south.But clearly, a lot of refinancings are coming due in the commercial real estate space over the next three years and definitely among the highest problem areas that we're watching in terms of delinquencies and credit quality.SEANA SMITH: Stephen, we know a lot of the focus in past earnings season most recently have been on guidance. We've already seen a number of the banks, specifically the regionals, already lower their guidance. M&amp;T Bank was one of those names that already lowered their forecast. Do you think we'll see further cuts here over the next several weeks?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Well, I would say, I mean, given that we have earnings coming out at the end of the week, banks have gone into a quiet period. We're probably not going to see additional drop here. A lot of that softer guidance came out during some of the conferences they had at the investment bank. So I think we're, you know, sort of set for the quarter here now that the quarter has ended.But, you know, I think the commentary and the guidance on the earnings calls that we get is probably not going to be a barn burner either, right? We're probably going to, you know, see more of the same banks sort of coming into the last quarter. Actually, some of them were expecting that the Fed would have been done raising interest rates, you know, by mid-year.That looks not to be the case as you look three months later now. Some had expected even a cut by the end of the year. That seems very much off the table now. So I think we're stuck with these higher rates, which will, again, dampen lending growth and slow the economy further, which is bad for credit quality.AKIKO FUJITA: Stephen, it's still a big concern that the regional lenders, the medium-sized banks-- we have seen in the spring, there was, like, JPMorgan swallowing up First Republic. I mean, when you look at the financial space right now, are you expecting more consolidation, you know, not necessarily failed banks, but just seeing where the banks are, especially the medium-sized banks, and the impact they're continuing to take from higher rates?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, I think-- and, you know, we've seen some support at the regulatory level. There might be some appetite for additional consolidation. I think, you know, most would say it's safe to say we're overbanked in the US. Particularly relative to other countries, we've got about 4,700 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the US today.They all can't make it, I would say, in this environment. I think it, you know, behooves most of them to take a look at partnerships and outright acquisitions if they can't do it themselves. That's tough for a bank, obviously, that wants to maintain its independence, you know, they feel they have the right product set for their local markets, and so forth.But the regulatory aspects here, what happens with the new-- particularly the regulations that are going to be put in place, it's going to make it very hard for banks to compete, for banks to continually elevate. You know, we know that capital cushions only go in one direction, right? And that's up. So they continually have to add more to the capital.Even as they grow larger, you would say it's counterintuitive that the larger banks have to set aside even more. But it doesn't make them safer. It makes them, you know, less prone to failure, certainly, and looks better in the eye of the regulators. So I think we'll see more consolidation here. I don't think we're going to have the number of banks over the next five or 10 years, but I think there's a lot of consolidation that needs to take place.SEANA SMITH: And, Stephen, what is the timeline of that consolidation? Is it something that's going to take years to play out?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, absolutely. I don't think we're-- you know, banks can only take on so much at a time. The large banks, when they do acquisitions that are sizable, I would say, about 1/3 of their asset base or higher, they tend to take about a year and a half to do that before they even can look at something even more significant. Smaller size or sort of token acquisitions that are in the same service territory, that makes sense. Maybe they can do that a little faster.But yeah, we're talking years here and not just a couple of quarters, obviously. You know, it took about 20 years for banks to have the number of banks that we have in the US. And it's probably going to take another 20, unless we get some, you know, very favorable regulatory environment that actually encourages consolidation. And I don't see that happening.SEANA SMITH: So, Stephen, given all this, given the very challenging sort of backdrop that we're in right now, who is best positioned in this environment?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Well, it'll still favor of the large banks, the JPMorgans, Bank of Americas, even Morgan Stanley, and some of the super regionals, I would say, like the Truist Financial, PNC Financial, U.S. Bancorp. These are banks that have already largely met the-- or can more easily meet the higher capital requirements. It will take them a matter of quarters, let's say, to no more than two years to reach these higher capital levels that are most likely to be in place.And we do expect, of course, the banks to sail through this year's stress test. The CICA results came in, but those are going to get more stringent going forward. We're going to have a scenario where interest rates spike over the forecast period versus decline, which has been the way it's worked with stress tests in the past.The Basel III international regulations are going to get more strict and severe as well. They're going to add a couple of more nuances to scenarios and what happens with banks, in particular about risk weighted assets and trading assets as well. So that will affect the Morgan Stanley's and Goldman Sachs of the world in particular. So I think those are still well positioned.Banks in the kind of $100 billion to $250 billion range or even $50 on their way to $100 billion are really going to have, you know, a tougher time. So I'd stick with the larger banks. They've got great earnings potential here. They're well diversified. They've got good yields at this point.And of course, many of these have suffered in the decline. They're well underperforming the market at this point. And that'll create some opportunities for investors.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, we'll start seeing these quarterly results later on this week. Stephen Biggar of Argus Research, thank you so much.STEPHEN BIGGAR: Thank you.]"

37,371dfb99-bd48-3f6f-86c8-4095faa6eec4,FE,2023-07-11,Potomac Edison Deploys Aerial Saw to Trim Trees in Hard-to-Access Areas,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/potomac-edison-deploys-aerial-saw-174800938.html,1689011280,STORY,['FE'],"[WILLIAMSPORT, Md., July 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) subsidiary Potomac Edison is using a helicopter equipped with an aerial saw to trim trees and ensure proper clearance around high-voltage power lines and electrical equipment along nearly 45 transmission corridors in Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. The work will continue through the summer and is expected to be completed this fall.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The transmission corridors are located in Carroll, Frederick, Garrett and Washington counties in Maryland; Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Mineral and Morgan counties in West Virginia; and Frederick, Page and Warren counties in Virginia.Maintaining proper clearances around transmission lines and electrical equipment can help prevent or minimize the impact of tree-related power outages, especially those associated with severe weather such as spring and summer thunderstorms.""Taking this proactive step to reinforce our high-voltage lines against tree-related damage is an important part of our vegetation management program and an effective way to reduce or minimize service interruptions for our customers,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations. ""This work complements the various investments we make in preserving and enhancing our electric grid each year.""In 2022, the amount of time Potomac Edison customers experienced service interruptions due to trees dropped by 11%, excluding major storms, compared to the previous year. Clearing incompatible vegetation under power lines also gives company personnel easier access to inspect and maintain lines and make repairs quicker if an outage occurs.Suspended on a boom beneath the helicopter and equipped with multiple 24-inch rotary blades, the aerial saw is typically deployed along transmission lines in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This fast, safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week. The saw also eliminates the risk of injury to workers using bucket trucks or climbing trees to cut limbs near high-voltage equipment.Story continuesThe saw cleanly cuts tree limbs 8 to 10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. Ground crews move limbs that have fallen onto roads, yards, agricultural fields or in streams. The ground crew will also flag and stop motorists along roads if the aerial saw is working nearby.The helicopter flies above and alongside transmission lines and may circle around to perform additional trimming. The pilot communicates with local airport personnel whenever the helicopter is operating within their air space.The helicopter trimming trees along the transmission lines is a white Hughes MD500 with blue and yellow stripes prominently marked with a registration number of N1102D in blue paint. The helicopter and saw are owned and operated by Aerial Solutions and will work only as weather conditions permit.In addition to trimming trees, helicopter crews have inspected nearly 1,500 miles of transmission lines (equal to about half the width of the United States) located in Potomac Edison's service territory. The inspections are designed to look for damaged wire, broken crossarms, failed insulators and other hardware problems not visible from the ground. Potential reliability issues identified during the inspection will be prioritized and addressed as quickly as possible. Vegetation management aerial patrols are also in progress to inspect vegetation on the transmission corridor.Potomac Edison serves about 285,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties in Maryland and about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Follow Potomac Edison at www.potomacedison.com, on Twitter @PotomacEdison, and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/PotomacEdison.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

And throughout his 37-year career, two things have never changed for him.""If I had to give advice to a young person starting out, I probably would say, ‘Stay true to your objectives. Set a goal for yourself and be passionate about what you do.' Because having that purpose and that passion to follow through is key to everything that we do.""Purpose and passion. Ron has been applying these two attributes for decades at a company known for an iconic product - Bubble Wrap® - that protects our valuables.""Bubble Wrap's first application was as a wallpaper. But its better application was protection. And one of the first products that it protected was something called a computer made by IBM.""He and his company kept innovating to create similar packaging to protect our food supply.""We all value the ability to go to a grocery store and select a wide variety of food items that are designed to be nutritious, safe and fresh and delivered in a very efficient manner. The innovation of plastic packaging enabled whole new categories of foods to be available to people as part of their diets in a very convenient and efficient way.""His company, SEE, is now applying that innovation in a new area: sustainability.In his role as vice president of global corporate affairs at SEE, Ron is bringing awareness to the circularity of packaging materials and the benefits it brings to society.""How can we take packaging materials that extend the shelf-life of food, that help protect things through e-commerce, and get those materials back so they can be recycled and put back into new products?""And in that role, he's inspiring a new generation to bring purpose and passion to helping protect our food. Our products. Our lives.Story continuesAnd our planet.Meet Ron. One of America's Change Makers.Sustainability is key to decisions at SEE, a packaging solutions provider, and for today's plastic makers.""Up until about 15 years ago, we never even used the term sustainability. But now we try to bring sustainability to life, to really understand what it means.""""Sustainability is defined in three parts: the economy, the environment, and the social impact. We have to remember that packaging doesn't exist for its own sake. It exists to move products to meet consumer demand, to allow people to have the quality of life in terms of the choice for their food. And today in e-commerce to buy goods and services.""SEE's R&amp;D teams are focused on the environmental aspect of sustainability, including ""designing for recyclability.""""We are a packaging manufacturer, so sustainability means creating the packaging in a form that can actually be recycled, helping ensure it is collected and can be made back into new packaging. We use design for recyclability in our everyday processes.""The concept of designing for recycling is expanding due to innovative technologies.""A few years ago, we were talking about design for recyclability as being specifically restricted to what we call mechanical recycling, what most of our municipal recycling facilities utilize. But today advanced recycling adds a new dimension to the way we can envision the use of materials, their recovery, and their reuse into new packaging.""Advanced recycling technologies allow us to dramatically expand the types and amount of plastic that can be recycled.""Advanced recycling to us is a natural extension of the mechanical recycling processes that are widely used today. Advanced recycling uses heat or energy to take plastic products and break them down into their building blocks to be reused. It allows us a broader selection of materials that we can use to provide even better packaging performance for things such as fresh cheese, meat, or other perishable goods in the grocery store.""Sustainability is a natural passion for Ron. As father to three adult sons, he's been motivated to make the world a better place.""I think my kids are probably saying, ‘Well, Dad is out there trying to save the world, one package at a time.' I've always tried to embed in my kids what can they do to help make the world a better place.""And as a senior leader at his company, Ron spends a lot of time motivating and mentoring younger professionals who will someday take his place.""My passion has always been to bring technology into a space that I can apply it to develop new things to make people see things in new ways. To kind of see the impact that they can have based on technical training, based on their personal interests, based on many aspects of their life. How do you motivate people to rise to a higher level of contribution to society?""To Ron, it all comes down to the two things that can inspire people to innovate and solve real world problems.""If you can bring purpose and passion together and motivate someone to drive towards greater goals and outcomes… My feeling is that person can contribute not only to their own personal satisfaction but to great contributions to society overall.""______________________________________________Meet Timi Fadiran, another Change Maker from SEE.The story of plastic is evolving.

ALGN has been gaining from Invisalign portfolio expansion. ALGN’s slew of strategic alliances looks impressive. However, economic uncertainty and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 32.1% compared with 19.8% growth of the industry and a 15.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $25.22 billion. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate of 17.2% is ahead of the industry’s anticipation of 12.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversInvisalign Portfolio Expansion: Align Technology’s Invisalign portfolio offers orthodontic treatment to straighten teeth without metal braces.During first quarter, ALGN launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in most markets. Instead of unlimited additional aligners within five years of the treatment end date, this latest configuration offers Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of treatment end date.The initial adoption of the product garnered a positive response. Management expects that its impact will be more meaningful and provide doctors with desired flexibility. Further, this will allow the company to recognize deferred revenues over a shorter period of time compared with the traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.Strategic Alliances: Align Technology's slew of strategic alliances looks promising. It has well-established relationships with many DSOs, especially in the United States, and is continuously exploring collaboration with others that drive adoption of digital dentistry. Recently, it announced a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring first quarter, ALGN delivered 7.8 billion impressions and had 22.1 million visits to its websites. IT continues to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube across markets.iTero in Focus: Align Technology has been focusing on expanding work-flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In first quarter, services revenues increased year over year. This was primarily driven by higher subscription revenues resulting from large number of iTero scanners in the field. The company also had higher non-systems revenues reflecting increased scanner rentals, upgrades and certified pre-owned or CPO leasing programs.Earlier in 2022, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs. The iTero Element Flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for Desktop Labs and will connect dentists directly with a suite of offerings from Desktop Labs.Story continuesDownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. It also competes with productions similar to Invisalign Technology, such as products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Economic Uncertainty: The general slowdown in the United States and certain international economies is having a negative impact on consumer spending and affecting Align Technology’s business fundamentals. ALGN attributed the waning earnings to this macroeconomic crisis that affected the overall dental market and led to continued soft dental sales of the company. Dental procedures are primarily elective in nature and are deferred when unemployment levels rise.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Align Technology’s 2023 earnings has moved 4.1% north to $8.31 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALGN’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.89 billion, suggesting a 4.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024. HOLX’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 27.3%.Hologic has gained 15.4% compared with the industry’s 12.5% growth in the past year.HealthEquity, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has an expected long-term growth rate of 22%.

Forty-six percent went on to say that without their support, their family or friends back home would not be able to afford good quality food.The study, which surveyed migrants living in Canada, demonstrates the positive affect that remittance payments have on families around the world. The report found that 61% of migrants believe that their families' quality of life has improved vastly due to the money that they send and 60% believe that their family and friends have more opportunities in life as a result of their remittance payments.How is remittance being used by families of migrants living in Canada?On average migrants were found to send 9% of their annual income as remittance. With the primary reasons being to support their families with the cost of groceries (61% of respondents), healthcare (54%) and accommodation (33%).

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group TransDigm Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Small, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$742 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$881. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 4.6% of Robert Small's stake. Robert Small was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of TransDigm GroupAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. TransDigm Group insiders own about US$217m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The TransDigm Group Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded TransDigm Group shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of TransDigm Group, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the real estate market, check out the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The real estate sector stands as a highly profitable industry globally, with its significance further emphasized by the interdependence between real estate development and some of the world's largest economies. Naturally, this also means that the industry is closely monitored by both governments and the wealthy. Encompassing various intricate facets, including the acquisition, sale, and administration of diverse properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces, the real estate industry involves a multitude of participants, ranging from real estate agents and brokers to property developers, landlords, property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions.According to a report, the global real estate industry was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021. Despite its substantial size, the segment is projected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030, reaching an estimated worth of $5.85 trillion by the conclusion of the forecast period. In addition to the residential sector, the commercial real estate (CRE) market constitutes a significant portion of the industry. More specifically, commercial real estate outperformed inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods and outperformed its own historical average in five of them. After enduring losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, returns in the CRE sector have experienced a partial recovery, accompanied by the resurgence of inflation. It is expected to mirror the overall growth rate of the sector, with a projected CAGR of 5.1% throughout the forecast period. Additionally, McKinsey states that commercial real estate returns have demonstrated strong performance over the seven inflationary periods spanning from 1980 to 2022, achieving an annualized rate of 11.7%. Notably, they have consistently outperformed inflation, and even outshined other asset classes such as the S&amp;P 500 and BBB corporate bonds.Story continuesHowever, all is not well in the CRE market. According to Bloomberg, the top US bank regulators are asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress in the commercial real estate market. With the sharp increase in borrowing costs, property owners are facing immense pressure, leading to defaults on debt by companies such as Brookfield Corporation. The situation is particularly challenging for office owners, as elevated borrowing costs make financing more difficult, and tenants are scaling back due to layoffs and the growing trend of remote work. According to the latest guidance, banks are advised to offer short-term loan accommodations to borrowers. These accommodations may involve deferring payments, accepting partial payments, or providing other forms of assistance. In this environment, lenders are now faced with challenging negotiations as approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate loans are due this year and next. Following this, major institutional owners including Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Brookfield and Pimco have already chosen to stop payments on some buildings, stating that they have ""better uses for their cash and resources"".The real estate industry is currently engaged in a significant debate regarding the future occupancy of vacant office buildings in various cities. As an example, cities such as San Francisco and Chicago are experiencing office vacancy rates approaching 25%. This has resulted in a decline of 50% in office real estate stocks compared to pre-Covid levels, while the REIT sector has experienced a 9.5% loss in the past year, in contrast to the S&amp;P 500's 14.5% gain. However, it's important to note that offices now represent only 3.4% of the $1 trillion public market for real estate investment trusts (REITs), and the broader REIT space is not facing the same level of challenges.On the other hand, the residential real estate (RRE) market seems to be faring somewhat better. Following a significant decline in new home prices, which dropped by 10% from their highest levels reached in February 2023, the prices are on an upward trend with the latest reading of April 2023. Furthermore, the regional housing index provided by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo contributes to this positive trend. The most recent reading for June indicates a sixth consecutive month of growth, with the index standing at 55. See also our list of the 10 Best Residential Real Estate Stocks To Buy.The real estate industry is currently experiencing transformative shifts due to technological advancements and enhanced capital availability. Most notably, investors looking to delve into the real estate market should be prepared for the ways online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology will impact all aspects of real estate transactions. Based on a report, investors can anticipate an increase in competition among property listing websites in the near future, all striving to facilitate seamless buying and selling experiences for aspiring and current property owners. While platforms such as Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long held a dominant position in the market, new and similar platforms will continue to emerge, further intensifying the competition. Technology will seemingly play a substantial role in the future of the real estate market, and major players will learn to maneuver the market accordingly, or they risk lagging behind the competition, of which there is plenty.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best commercial real estate stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), and Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD).12 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Fundsyoussef-abdelwahab-qyzo7TDSVQs-unsplashOur MethodologyWe selected the following real estate stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

71,304efce5-b265-3ab8-8f5d-8224fd55aa3d,PPG,2023-07-11,PPG Industries and The Andersons have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-andersons-highlighted-zacks-115300274.html,1688989980,STORY,"['PPG', 'ANDE', 'WFC', 'PNC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 10, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PPG Industries, Inc. PPG as the Bull of the Day and The Andersons, Inc. ANDE as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC and M&amp;T Bank Corp. MTB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:PPG Industries, Inc. is bullish about the growth in paints and coatings in 2023 as the auto industry and aerospace outperformed in Q1. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by 20.2% this year.PPG was founded in Pennsylvania in 1883. The company is celebrating its 140th year in business this year. It develops and delivers paints, coatings and specialty materials to customers in more than 70 countries. It has customers in the construction, consumer products, industrial and transportation markets and aftermarkets.PPG Outlines Growth FrameworkOn May 24, 2023, PPG shared its PPG framework for purposeful, profitable growth for the next 4 years.It aims to establish annual 2% to 4% organic sales growth. It expects annual adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12% through 2026.Additionally, it aims for free cash flow of about $1 billion per year.Record Q1 SalesOn Apr 20, 2023, PPG reported its first quarter results and blew by the Zacks Consensus, reporting earnings of $1.82 versus the consensus of $1.55. That's a beat of $0.27, or 17.4%.It was the second beat in a row for PPG.The company saw record first quarter sales of $4.38 billion, up 2% from $4.308 billion in the prior year due to an 8% rise in selling prices while volumes declined 3%.Several businesses outperformed the company's original forecast including the aerospace coatings business and the Latin America region, with both delivering record sales. PPG's automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coatings business also was boosted by solid global production growth.Story continuesAnalysts Getting Bullish AgainPPG will report second quarter results on July 20, 2023. In April, the company believed the macro environment would generally remain consistent with the first quarter with continued stabilization of economic activity at lower levels in Europe and modestly improving demand in China.In the US, PPG expected sequential slowing in economic activity in certain end-use markets, particularly in those that were construction-related.It gave full year earnings guidance in the range of $6.95 to $7.25.But analysts don't seem to think the April forecast is going to be correct. 1 analyst has raised both the 2023 and 2024 earnings estimate in the last week and that has pushed the consensus above the company's guidance range.The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $7.27 from $6.84 just 3 months ago. That's earnings growth of 20.2% over 2022 where the company made $6.05.Shares Attractively ValuedShares of PPG are up 16.7% year-to-date which is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is up 14.6%.But it is still attractively valued with a forward P/E of 20 and a PEG ratio of just 1.1. It also has a price-to-sales ratio of just 1.9.PPG is also shareholder friendly and pays a dividend, yielding 1.7%.For investors looking for a play on the industrial and chemical side of the economy, PPG Industries should be one on your short list.Bear of the Day:The Andersons, Inc. is navigating a changing agriculture market in 2023. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings decline nearly 35% this year.The Andersons is an agribusiness company which has grown, over the last 76 years, from a single grain elevator to a diverse company with commodity merchandising (trade), renewables, and nutrient and industrial specialties.It has 79 facilities in the trade division, 4 in renewables and 37 in nutrient and industrial.Q1 Record for TradeOn May 2, 2023, The Andersons reported its first quarter 2023 results and beat the Zacks Consensus by $0.03. Earnings were $0.20 versus the consensus of $0.17. It was the fourth earnings beat in a row. It's last earnings miss came at the start of the Ukraine War when it got caught on the wrong side of the trade as prices spiked.Trade led the first quarter this year, with an adjusted pretax income of $24 million, a record first quarter. Renewables saw a pretax loss of $83 million  while Nutrient &amp; Industrial also reported a pretax loss of $10 million on a slow start to the planting season.Fertilizer prices fell in the quarter and customers deferred purchasing. The Andersons said some of the typical first quarter business would shift into Q2, but The Andersons didn't believe all of it would be recovered.The company continues to generate strong free cash flows. The Andersons is shareholder friendly and currently pays a dividend yielding 1.6%.Analysts Are BearishThe 2023 Zacks Consensus has been on the decline over the last 60 days as one analyst had cut estimates during that time. The Zacks Consensus has fallen to $2.65 from $2.94 over the last 2 months.That is an earnings decline of 34.6% over 2022 which saw The Andersons make $4.05.However, keep in mind that The Andersons is a small cap company with a market cap of just $1.6 billion. Small cap companies are lightly covered on Wall Street compared to the large caps. Zacks only has 2 full year estimates for 2023.Shares Up in 2023Despite the earnings decline, shares are up 33.4% year-to-date and are trading near 52-week highs.It's not cheap on a P/E basis as it has a forward P/E of 17.6 but it has dirt-cheap P/B and P/S ratios of 1.2 and 0.09, respectively.Still, the rebound off the 2022 sell-off appears to be priced in now but the shares have yet to take out the 2022 highs. The Andersons will report second quarter results on Aug 1, 2023. Investors interested in an agribusiness company should tune into the earnings results. They could be a catalyst for some positive earnings estimate revisions, and a change in the Zacks Rank.Additional content:What to Expect from Wells Fargo's (WFC) Q2 Earnings Report?Wells Fargo &amp; Company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 14, before the opening bell. The company's quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to have improved year over year.In the last reported quarter, WFC's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher net interest income (NII) and solid average loan growth. The fall in non-interest expenses acted as another tailwind. However, dismal non-interest income, higher provisions and weakness in the mortgage business were the major undermining factors.Over the trailing four quarters, Wells Fargo's earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 7.17%.Let's take a look at factors that are expected to have influenced Wells Fargo's second-quarter earnings.Loans and NII: Banks' lending activities are likely to have declined in the second quarter, as the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates impacted consumer spending. Per Fed's latest data, demand for commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans and consumer loans decreased in April and May from first-quarter end.Nonetheless, in May 2023, Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 5-5.25%, the highest since 2008. Further, in June it declared no changes in the given policy rate. Driven by interest rate hikes, Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed an improvement in earning asset yields, margin and NII in the quarter to be reported. Also, lower mortgage-backed securities premium amortization is expected to have aided NII.Amid these considerations, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC's NII is pegged at $12.94 billion, indicating a 26.9% rise from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.Mortgage Banking Revenues: In first-quarter 2023, Wells Fargo communicated its strategic plans to exit Correspondent business with an intention to reduce risks in mortgage business. Further, in the second quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.81% in June, up from 4.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing compared with the prior-year quarter.Hence, being one of the largest bank mortgage lenders in the United States, WFC is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking income in second-quarter 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC's second-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $250 million, implying a 12.9% fall on a year-over-year basis.Overall Non-Interest Revenues: Wells Fargo's investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have borne the brunt of weaker equity and fixed-income market performance. A dip in market valuations and lower transactional activities are expected to have been headwinds too.Further, the company is likely to have seen lower deposit-related fees due to an expected decline in deposits given the impact of regional bank collapses. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $1.15 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 16.2%.Global deal making is likely to have continued shrinking in the second quarter from the prior year, with deal volume and total deal value numbers crashing. Geopolitical tensions, inflation, high interest rates and fears of a global recession are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals.Similarly, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances are expected to have dried up in the to-be-reported quarter. Bond issuance volume might have witnessed a decline too as investors turned pessimistic.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo's total non-interest income is pegged at $7.23 billion, suggesting a 5.9% increase from the prior-year quarter's reported number.Expenses: Wells Fargo's costs are expected to have continued flaring up in the second quarter, given its franchise investments in technology and digitalization efforts. Additionally, amid the rising inflation, salary expenses are anticipated to have led to elevated non-interest expenses. This is likely to have hindered bottom-line growth during the quarter under review.Asset Quality: With expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook and growing recession risk, Wells Fargo's credit quality is likely to have deteriorated. Moreover, given the heighted market volatility, commercial loan defaults are expected to have risen. Hence, as WFC has a substantial exposure to commercial loans, it is likely to increase reserves in the second quarter.What Our Model PredictsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of WFC beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +0.16%.Zacks Rank: WFC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 2.5% downward in the past week to $1.16 per share.

The latest quarterly performance has provided momentum to the ongoing production ramp-up, showcasing the mine's untapped potential.Barrick is currently assessing additional expansion opportunities based on an updated geological model. Furthermore, drilling at the Kababisa prospect has revealed higher-grade deposits, highlighting the potential for increased mining flexibility.The Lumwana pre-feasibility study aligns with Barrick's strategy to enhance the long-term copper profile of the mine through the development of the envisioned super pit. This ambitious plan aims to unlock the mine's full potential, driving sustained growth and profitability.Barrick's commitment to Africa since 2019 has solidified Lumwana's significance in the expansion of its strategic copper portfolio. In addition to contributing significantly to Barrick's bottom line, the mine has become a vital contributor to Zambia's economy, injecting more than $2.3 billion through royalties, taxes, salaries and local supplier purchases.Reflecting its commitment to the local community, Barrick follows a global policy of sourcing suppliers locally. Last year, the company spent $432 million, accounting for 83% of its total procurement, with Zambian suppliers and contractors. Moreover, Barrick has initiated the ""Business Accelerator Program"" aimed at building the capacity of Zambian contractors in the mining supply chain.Barrick's dedication to local employment is also evident, with 99.3% of Lumwana's employees and 98% of its contractors being Zambian nationals. As a participant in the United Nations' REDD+ project, Lumwana actively contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions resulting from deforestation. The mine has engaged with its communities to promote and support this environmentally responsible initiative.Barrick's ongoing expansion plans for the Lumwana copper mine demonstrate its commitment to long-term growth, benefiting both the company and the local economy. With the mine's potential yet to be fully realized, GOLD is poised to establish Lumwana as a leading copper asset in the global market.GOLD shares have lost 3.8% in the past year against the 13.5% growth of its industry.

Barrick expects attributable production of 260-290 million pounds for Lumwana in 2023. Attributable production from the mine was 267 million pounds in 2022.The company also projects total copper production in the range of 420-470 million pounds for 2023. It envisions copper production to be stronger in the second half of the year, primarily due to steadily increasing throughput at Lumwana.Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus Barrick Gold Corporation Price and ConsensusBarrick Gold Corporation price-consensus-chart | Barrick Gold Corporation Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksBarrick currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include PPG Industries, Inc.

73,cfaa819d-6e56-3b49-83a2-625c7b7b91cc,GS,2023-07-11,Bank earnings: Headwinds to watch out for,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bank-earnings-headwinds-watch-201818678.html,1689020298,VIDEO,"['JPM', 'GS', 'MS', 'C', 'WFC', 'BAC']","[Big banks will start reporting their quarterly results on Friday, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo on tap. Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research at Argus Research, tells Yahoo Finance what is he expecting to hear from banks this quarter.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Tougher capital rules for US banks proposed by the Fed's Barr isn't the only thing that investors are closely watching. Earnings season is just around the corner. And the nation's largest banks are gearing up to report their quarterly results. Here with more on what we can expect, we want to bring in Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research for Argus Research.Stephen, it's good to see you. So certainly, a challenging set up here for the banks, a higher interest rate environment. We have also the possibility here of stricter regulations. And the implications of that is something that investors are waiting to see. How does this set us up for this round of earnings season?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, so, well, I think it's going to be, you know, not banks' finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter. Clearly, the higher rate environment that was very helpful in 2022 for net interest margins is having a detrimental effect now. You've got slowing loan growth, just less demand as you have much higher interest rates here. And that's the intended effect of the Federal Reserve.Net interest margins, it looks like they peaked in the fourth quarter of last year. We're likely to see additional pressure sequentially on margins as deposit rates have really increased quite a bit here as banks try to stay competitive with a lot of higher-yielding alternatives out there. And then, of course, on the other bit of lending, the business would be loss provisions.And, you know, we're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market. So I think banks are going to be conservative here, add to loan loss provisions. And all in all, of course, all three of those will dampen earnings growth a little bit for the quarter.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: So you talk about the growth we're likely to see in loan losses, defaults in credit card payments. But we've heard repeatedly about the potential cliff waiting, especially in commercial real estate. What are you going to be looking for, at least in this quarter, in terms of the potential rising risk on that front for banks?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, definitely, the commercial real estate does, you know, loom as a potential problem area. And we've seen some defaults already kind of pick up there. You know, I think banks did a very good job in the first quarter of laying out the risks there.Typically, for the very large banks, commercial real estate is about 10% of their loan book. Commercial and the office space in particular, which is where a lot of the damage is and the higher delinquency rates, is typically more like, you know, 3% to 4%. It's quite a bit higher, about double that, at the regional bank level, but still, you know, manageable at this point.And of course, the underwriting standards have been better in commercial real estate than they were 5 or 10 or 15 years ago. So that's beneficial for banks. They have generally about a 40-- or 60, I should say, 60% loan to value in there. And, you know, that gives them a fair amount of leeway should these go south.But clearly, a lot of refinancings are coming due in the commercial real estate space over the next three years and definitely among the highest problem areas that we're watching in terms of delinquencies and credit quality.SEANA SMITH: Stephen, we know a lot of the focus in past earnings season most recently have been on guidance. We've already seen a number of the banks, specifically the regionals, already lower their guidance. M&amp;T Bank was one of those names that already lowered their forecast. Do you think we'll see further cuts here over the next several weeks?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Well, I would say, I mean, given that we have earnings coming out at the end of the week, banks have gone into a quiet period. We're probably not going to see additional drop here. A lot of that softer guidance came out during some of the conferences they had at the investment bank. So I think we're, you know, sort of set for the quarter here now that the quarter has ended.But, you know, I think the commentary and the guidance on the earnings calls that we get is probably not going to be a barn burner either, right? We're probably going to, you know, see more of the same banks sort of coming into the last quarter. Actually, some of them were expecting that the Fed would have been done raising interest rates, you know, by mid-year.That looks not to be the case as you look three months later now. Some had expected even a cut by the end of the year. That seems very much off the table now. So I think we're stuck with these higher rates, which will, again, dampen lending growth and slow the economy further, which is bad for credit quality.AKIKO FUJITA: Stephen, it's still a big concern that the regional lenders, the medium-sized banks-- we have seen in the spring, there was, like, JPMorgan swallowing up First Republic. I mean, when you look at the financial space right now, are you expecting more consolidation, you know, not necessarily failed banks, but just seeing where the banks are, especially the medium-sized banks, and the impact they're continuing to take from higher rates?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, I think-- and, you know, we've seen some support at the regulatory level. There might be some appetite for additional consolidation. I think, you know, most would say it's safe to say we're overbanked in the US. Particularly relative to other countries, we've got about 4,700 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the US today.They all can't make it, I would say, in this environment. I think it, you know, behooves most of them to take a look at partnerships and outright acquisitions if they can't do it themselves. That's tough for a bank, obviously, that wants to maintain its independence, you know, they feel they have the right product set for their local markets, and so forth.But the regulatory aspects here, what happens with the new-- particularly the regulations that are going to be put in place, it's going to make it very hard for banks to compete, for banks to continually elevate. You know, we know that capital cushions only go in one direction, right? And that's up. So they continually have to add more to the capital.Even as they grow larger, you would say it's counterintuitive that the larger banks have to set aside even more. But it doesn't make them safer. It makes them, you know, less prone to failure, certainly, and looks better in the eye of the regulators. So I think we'll see more consolidation here. I don't think we're going to have the number of banks over the next five or 10 years, but I think there's a lot of consolidation that needs to take place.SEANA SMITH: And, Stephen, what is the timeline of that consolidation? Is it something that's going to take years to play out?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, absolutely. I don't think we're-- you know, banks can only take on so much at a time. The large banks, when they do acquisitions that are sizable, I would say, about 1/3 of their asset base or higher, they tend to take about a year and a half to do that before they even can look at something even more significant. Smaller size or sort of token acquisitions that are in the same service territory, that makes sense. Maybe they can do that a little faster.But yeah, we're talking years here and not just a couple of quarters, obviously. You know, it took about 20 years for banks to have the number of banks that we have in the US. And it's probably going to take another 20, unless we get some, you know, very favorable regulatory environment that actually encourages consolidation. And I don't see that happening.SEANA SMITH: So, Stephen, given all this, given the very challenging sort of backdrop that we're in right now, who is best positioned in this environment?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Well, it'll still favor of the large banks, the JPMorgans, Bank of Americas, even Morgan Stanley, and some of the super regionals, I would say, like the Truist Financial, PNC Financial, U.S. Bancorp. These are banks that have already largely met the-- or can more easily meet the higher capital requirements. It will take them a matter of quarters, let's say, to no more than two years to reach these higher capital levels that are most likely to be in place.And we do expect, of course, the banks to sail through this year's stress test. The CICA results came in, but those are going to get more stringent going forward. We're going to have a scenario where interest rates spike over the forecast period versus decline, which has been the way it's worked with stress tests in the past.The Basel III international regulations are going to get more strict and severe as well. They're going to add a couple of more nuances to scenarios and what happens with banks, in particular about risk weighted assets and trading assets as well. So that will affect the Morgan Stanley's and Goldman Sachs of the world in particular. So I think those are still well positioned.Banks in the kind of $100 billion to $250 billion range or even $50 on their way to $100 billion are really going to have, you know, a tougher time. So I'd stick with the larger banks. They've got great earnings potential here. They're well diversified. They've got good yields at this point.And of course, many of these have suffered in the decline. They're well underperforming the market at this point. And that'll create some opportunities for investors.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, we'll start seeing these quarterly results later on this week. Stephen Biggar of Argus Research, thank you so much.STEPHEN BIGGAR: Thank you.]"

Investors may also check this stock out for its favorable growth estimates.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceGPN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past month, the stock has gained 5.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 3.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Payments’ 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.37 per share, indicating an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago reported figure on 6.7% higher revenues of $8.6 billion.The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $11.89, suggesting a 14.7% improvement from the prior-year reported figure on 6.8% higher revenues of $9.2 billion.Business TailwindsGlobal Payments has been witnessing growth in revenues over the last few years on the back of improving cross-border and domestic corporate travel, and transaction volumes. Merchant Solutions contributed 69.1% to total revenues in 2022. This is expected to grow further as transaction fees will boost on the back of volume growth.Adjusted net revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment is estimated to stay at the higher end of the 15-16% range in 2023. The segment is set to benefit from strength in technology-enabled businesses and the recovery of Asia-Pacific business.The company expects to deliver 5-6% net revenue growth in the Issuer Solutions segment in 2023 owing to exceptional first-quarter performance and a solid conversion pipeline. MineralTree and Netspend B2B business will grow at low double digits which, in turn, will aid the segment. Global Payments has signed multi-year extensions with M&amp;T Bank and has nine letters of intent which will fuel growth in the future.GPN does not hesitate to boost its global footprint with ambitious acquisitions. It acquired EVO Payments, Inc. in August 2022, a leading payments and services provider, which offers a plethora of solutions to merchants in the United States and Europe. This acquisition expands GPN’s geographic presence, supplements its B2B business and most importantly supports its technology-based payments strategy.Story continuesGlobal Payments divested the consumer portion of its Netspend business, aiming to focus on its core corporate customers. It also entered into a definitive agreement to sell its gaming business. This highlights its unwavering focus on building up its core operations. These moves should lead to lower expenses and improve the bottom line in the future.GPN focuses on top-tier strategic partnerships to grow its business. It has partnered with AWS to deploy cloud-based analytics and data platform for financial institutions. It has also inked a deal with Mondu to serve financial services customers across use cases, like prepaid cards, lending solutions and credit cards. Further, it has collaborated with leading parks and entertainment companies to provide beverage and Xenial food solutions.The company’s financial flexibility enables it to invest in technology, strategic partnerships and return capital to shareholders. GPN exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $2,001.7 million, way above the current portion of long-term debt of $1,185.3 million. It bought back shares worth $200 million in the first quarter of 2023.An increase in capacity of the company’s share buyback program was made to bring the total authorization amount to $1,295.7 million. Hence, a strong financial position remains an additional tailwind for Global Payments. This should instill confidence in shareholders.Key ConcernsHowever, a few factors have been impeding the stock’s growth lately.Rising operating expenses are harming its margins. Despite cost management efforts, operating expenses rose 25.6% year over year. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services space are Paysafe Limited PSFE, Visa Inc. V and WEX Inc. WEX. Paysafe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Visa and WEX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.London-based Paysafe is a digital commerce solutions provider for different businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PSFE’s 2023 earnings has improved more than 240% in the past 60 days.Headquartered in San Francisco, Visa is a global payments technology giant. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa’s current-year earnings indicates a 14.5% year-over-year increase.Based in Portland, ME, WEX is a commerce platform operator. It operates in the United States as well as globally.

It's Mattel stock (MAT), as the 78-year-old toymaker appears to have struck cultural relevance gold with its upcoming ""Barbie"" movie.Shares of Mattel are up 15% over the past month, outperforming the stock price of Mr. Potato Head-selling Hasbro, which has a 7% gain. And since you are wondering, shares of Nvidia are up 9% in the last month, Meta stock has notched a 12% increase, and Apple stock has trucked along with a 4% improvement.Mattel's ""Barbie"" is a live-action PG-13 flick headlined by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It was directed by Greta Gerwig and reportedly had a budget of up to $100 million to make.The movie is slated to hit theaters on July 21, and Robbie, Gosling, and the rest of the star-studded cast are currently out doing red carpet events to build anticipation.""Barbie is a cultural conversation at this point,"" Mattel COO Richard Dickson told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Dickson is credited with reinventing Barbie and making the brand more in line with cultural trends in his work at Mattel over the last five years.Mattel is betting that the cultural conversation around Barbie materializes in strong profit figures, created in a few different ways.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend the World Premiere of ""Barbie"" on July 09, 2023, in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/FilmMagic,)First is through the licensing of the Barbie name to merchandise that has sprouted up everywhere ahead of the movie's release. Mattel, for instance, inked a Barbie apparel deal with specialty retailer Gap (GPS) that hit stores on May 23.The product line ranges from pink Barbie hoodies to pink pet clothing.Fast fashion house Forever 21 has also released a Barbie-inspired clothing line.""I think what really becomes more interesting as you see the Barbie brand evolve is from a character into a platform and ultimately a franchise,"" Dickson said. ""And so from toys to lifestyle products to live experiences, digital gaming, now film, you really start to see the manifestation and the monetization of the power of this incredible franchise.""Story continuesDancer Kim Manning performs a routine to promote the film ""Barbie"" at the WeHo Pride Parade in West Hollywood, Calif., on Sunday, June 4, 2023. AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)The other profit driver is likely to come from the movie itself, which was produced by Mattel Films and is being distributed by Warner Bros.Stifel analyst Drew Crum recently estimated the ""Barbie"" movie could haul in $400 million at the box office. Crum's previous sales estimate stood at $325 million.""Barbie is the first of several movie releases from Mattel Films, with a stated mission to be an IP-driven toy business, and thus we see a successful launch as driving greater confidence around this part of the company's strategy,"" Crum said. ""And a higher box office = higher profits for Mattel ~ since the company did not fund production our estimates (including adj. EPS = $0.08) are admittedly modest, but a stronger showing in theaters certainly can't hurt numbers.""And lastly, a successful Barbie debut could validate the 14 other content projects in development for Mattel, including a Warner Bros. movie based on the toy car brand Matchbox.CEO of Mattel, Ynon Kreiz, arrives at the premiere of ""Barbie"" on Sunday, July 9, 2023, at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)Investors appear to be betting in advance that some of those projects pay off financially for Mattel, based solely on early reads for Barbie.""Barbie is clearly an important brand. It's one of our three power brands, and it will be in many ways a showcase for the quality of the movies that we're looking to make, the type of partnerships we're formulating with lead talent in Hollywood, working with major studios,"" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told Yahoo Finance Live.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 3.5% gain over the past four weeks.SLB’s shares rallied on the last trading day. The bullishness could be attributed to the sustained high oil and gas prices, which is encouraging customers to increase drilling activities. This has increased demand for the company’s oilfield services. With the strong demand for its services, SLB is well positioned to generate significant free cash flows this year as it is one of the largest oilfield service players in the world.This world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +42%. Revenues are expected to be $8.26 billion, up 21.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Schlumberger, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

Further, during the quarter, the company’s operating margin was impacted by legal settlement costs, a rise in inflationary costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses and increased R&amp;D investments post the acquisition of Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.The cost of net sales in the quarter was up 6.5% year over year. The core operating margin was 14.2% in the quarter, contracting 14 bps year over year at CER. The company’s operating margin in the quarter was impacted by an unfavorable product mix from lower PCIOL sales in South Korea, higher R&amp;D investment following the acquisition of Aerie and a negative 1.3 percentage point impact from currency.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Health Equity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

81,33e2c96e-da06-33b9-ac5e-a4fedfd48724,HOLX,2023-07-11,Here's Why Investors Should Hold Align Technology (ALGN) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-hold-align-150700378.html,1689001620,STORY,"['ALGN', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Align Technology, Inc. ALGN has been gaining from Invisalign portfolio expansion. ALGN’s slew of strategic alliances looks impressive. However, economic uncertainty and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 32.1% compared with 19.8% growth of the industry and a 15.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $25.22 billion. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate of 17.2% is ahead of the industry’s anticipation of 12.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversInvisalign Portfolio Expansion: Align Technology’s Invisalign portfolio offers orthodontic treatment to straighten teeth without metal braces.During first quarter, ALGN launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in most markets. Instead of unlimited additional aligners within five years of the treatment end date, this latest configuration offers Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of treatment end date.The initial adoption of the product garnered a positive response. Management expects that its impact will be more meaningful and provide doctors with desired flexibility. Further, this will allow the company to recognize deferred revenues over a shorter period of time compared with the traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.Strategic Alliances: Align Technology's slew of strategic alliances looks promising. It has well-established relationships with many DSOs, especially in the United States, and is continuously exploring collaboration with others that drive adoption of digital dentistry. Recently, it announced a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring first quarter, ALGN delivered 7.8 billion impressions and had 22.1 million visits to its websites. IT continues to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube across markets.iTero in Focus: Align Technology has been focusing on expanding work-flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In first quarter, services revenues increased year over year. This was primarily driven by higher subscription revenues resulting from large number of iTero scanners in the field. The company also had higher non-systems revenues reflecting increased scanner rentals, upgrades and certified pre-owned or CPO leasing programs.Earlier in 2022, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs. The iTero Element Flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for Desktop Labs and will connect dentists directly with a suite of offerings from Desktop Labs.Story continuesDownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. It also competes with productions similar to Invisalign Technology, such as products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Economic Uncertainty: The general slowdown in the United States and certain international economies is having a negative impact on consumer spending and affecting Align Technology’s business fundamentals. ALGN attributed the waning earnings to this macroeconomic crisis that affected the overall dental market and led to continued soft dental sales of the company. Dental procedures are primarily elective in nature and are deferred when unemployment levels rise.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Align Technology’s 2023 earnings has moved 4.1% north to $8.31 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALGN’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.89 billion, suggesting a 4.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

DGX recently partnered with Proov, a manufacturer of at-home fertility and hormone tests, to offer the Proov Confirm PdG home collection kit for evaluating fertility available to women. The tests are aimed toward women who intend to start or grow a family through questhealth.com.The Proov Confirm PdG test is the first and only PdG (progesterone metabolite) home test kit to confirm successful ovulation that has been approved by the FDA.The latest move will expand Quest Diagnostics’ portfolio of testing services, fortifying the Diagnostic Solutions business.More on PdG TestThe PdG test is the first women's health test offered through questhealth.com that was manufactured by a different company. The Proov Confirm home collection kit can be purchased now on questhealth.com for $29. It involves a urine test, similar to an at-home pregnancy test, with results in 5-10 minutes.The PdG test is the first women's health test from a third-party manufacturer available through questhealth.com. In addition, users can also download the free Proov Insight app to receive reminders to test, gain help in interpreting results and personalize an action plan.Benefits of PdG TestA reproductive hormone called progesterone aids in preparing the uterine lining for implantation and pregnancy. The implantation window is the period after ovulation when progesterone levels should be raised to promote implantation. Pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), the main urine metabolite of progesterone, is designed to be detected by the Proov Confirm PdG test and can be used as a tool to help confirm ovulation. The ""implantation window"" is a four-day period where PdG levels in the urine are measured to determine whether ovulation was successful.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccording to the Centres for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, up to one in five women have fertility problems. It is recommended that women with ovulation problems consult with a healthcare professional about possible causes of the problem. For individuals who have tried unsuccessfully to get pregnant, the test might be appropriate. Women who have experienced previous infertility problems, PCOS, endometriosis, are 35 years of age or older, or who are using fertility drugs may also find it helpful.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global Fertility Test Market size was valued at $462.23 million in 2020, and is projected to reach $842.96 million by 2028, registering a CAGR of 7.8%. Fertility test market growth is attributed to rise in the prevalence of diseases such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) as women with the condition of PCOS do not ovulate each month regularly due to the overproduction of estrogen by the ovaries.Recent DevelopmentsIn June 2023, Quest Diagnostics completed its previously-announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. The acquisition is intended to improve patient outcomes through early, accurate detection of residual or recurring cancer. By combining its strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing with Haystack's liquid biopsy technology, DGX will likely dominate the rapidly-expanding MRD sector.The same month, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Coriell Life Sciences to provide select medical plan members with pharmacogenomics testing services. The test indicates how different genes and their variants affect an individual’s reaction to drugs. The pharmacogenomics test is a voluntary, no cost DNA-testing programme that uses a saliva collection kit that can be used at home to analyze a person's DNA. The effectiveness of the patient's existing drugs is evaluated in light of the test results.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 3.8% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 7%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

83,18d3ca59-5849-35df-b278-de5d35425285,HOLX,2023-07-11,Here's Why You Should Retain Chemed (CHE) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-chemed-che-122500696.html,1688991900,STORY,"['CHE', 'HOLX', 'ZBH', 'HAE']","[Chemed Corporation CHE is likely to grow in the coming quarters, backed by the solid performance of the VITAS Healthcare and Roto-Rooter segments. The increased capacity expansion derived from Chemed’s hiring and retention program is driving VITAS’ admission growth. The company’s favorable solvent position at the first quarter-end of 2023 buoys optimism.However, escalating expenses and high dependence on government programs do not bode well for Chemed.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 5.6% compared to the 7.6% fall of the industry and a 14% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned hospice care provider has a market capitalization of $8.11 billion. Chemed projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 8.8% compared with 10.6% of the industry. CHE’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 0.94%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesRoto-Rooter Continues to Expand: Chemed’s Roto-Rooter segment continues to be well-positioned, with the ongoing demand for key services in commercial and residential segments significantly above the pre-pandemic level. Both branch commercial and residential revenues improved in the last reported quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement anticipates that the segment’s market share will continue its upward trend, banking on the company’s core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time and 24/7 call centers and internet presence.VITAS’ Prospects Look Bright: In the first quarter of 2023, the year-over-year revenue increase in the VITAS Healthcare business segment included a 3% rise in days of care and a geographically-weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 2.9%.Chemed implemented a targeted hiring and retention bonus program at VITAS in July 2022. In the first quarter, VITAS increased its licensed healthcare staff by 200 professionals, with the majority being licensed nurses, expanding to 475.Story continuesStrong Solvency: Chemed remains well-capitalized having exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $58.1 million. The total debt at the end of the first quarter was $21 million, much lower than the current cash level.With the reported short-term payable debt at the quarter end being $5 million, the company holds sufficient cash for short-term debt repayment during the economic downturn. Further, the CHE’s quarter-end dividend payout rate of 7.7% seems sustainable, sequentially up from 7.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.DownsidesDependence on Government Mandates: The Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasing pressure to control healthcare costs and cut or limit increases in reimbursement rates for healthcare services. Like most government programs, these are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, possible retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions.With more than 95% of VITAS’ revenues consisting of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, all of these may adversely affect the level of program payments and have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.Escalating Expenses: Chemed lagged earnings and revenue estimates in the first quarter. Mounting costs and expenses weighed on the company’s margins.The persistent macroeconomic headwinds related to volatility in COVID-19 trends, rising inflationary pressure and other challenges continue to hamper business performance.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chemed’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $20.77 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.26 billion.

You can skip our detailed analysis on poverty in the United States, and head over directly to the 10 States with the Lowest Poverty Rates in America.Poverty rate in the United States has continued to steadily decline over the last decade. 11.2% of the population lived below the poverty line, $27,479 for a family of four, in 2021, compared to 14.8% in 2011, according to the Census Bureau. In terms of demographics, communities most affected by poverty in order are the Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics. Similarly, geographically, there are states that are poorer than some of their wealthy counterparts.New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate in the US among all 50 states. It is followed by Minnesota and New Jersey at second and third on the list of states with the lowest poverty rates. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Mississippi is the poorest state in the US having the highest poverty in the country with a population of 18.1% living below the poverty line.The United States is divided by its stark income inequality. One factor why poverty rates are low in some states compared to others is significant corporate presence in these states which leads to production of jobs and economic opportunity. This factor also indicates that these states are business friendly and have optimal economic policies in place.Maryland is one example. It is not just among the states with the lowest poverty rates, but is also one of the wealthiest states in America in terms of household income. There are at least 10 billionaires and more than 220,000 millionaires in the state.The world's largest hotel chain, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. It has over a 100 hotels in the state of Maryland, providing employment to thousands of residents in the hospitality industry. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) reported a net income of $757 million in the first quarter of 2023, earing $2.43 per share.Story continuesLikewise, the state of New Jersey is home to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a leading American multinational corporation that produces pharmaceutical, medical, and consumer packaged goods, and is a source of employment for the local community. It was founded in 1886 in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where it still has its corporate head office. The consumer division of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is located in Skillman. The company is part of the Fortune 500 list of companies in the US having the highest revenue. Merck, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Cognizant are other prominent companies that are headquartered in the state, and contribute to the region's economic success.Virginia, which is in our list of states with the lowest poverty rates, has some of the biggest defense companies based in the state. One of them being the aerospace and armament manufacturer, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) which is headquartered in Reston. It is one of the largest defense contractors of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had a revenue of close to $40 billion, and received more than $21 billion in DoD contracts. You can read more about the biggest companies in Virginia in our article here.At the same time, several corporations such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) are also undertaking voluntary initiatives to accelerate economic growth in areas with high poverty rates. TechSpark, a program launched by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), to provide digital access and skills to residents of rural areas has enabled 88% of the schools in Northeast Wisconsin to offer Computer Sciences education, which bodes well for their future career prospects.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Employee Giving Program, which started in 2011 has already raised $880 million for people going through difficult times such as stress, poverty, or violence. The company matches dollar payments contributed by its employees in this cause, and also raises money in the pool for every hour volunteered by an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee to help those in need.Another fine example is that of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), which is one of the leading financial institutions in the United States.

Please enjoy this extended Q&amp;A session with Jeanne-Mey Sun, Vice President of Sustainability, elaborating on our progress, goals, and future at NRG.Q: As you look back on sustainability at NRG in 2022, what were some of the highlights?A: 2022 was another year of progress, made possible by collaboration and innovation both internally and externally. Three priorities guided our work. First, we continued to report our sustainability strategy, governance, plans, and progress to our stakeholders as transparently as possible, following the most widely accepted standards. In 2022, we:Reported International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) metrics for the 7th year¹Issued our 2nd annual report on the climate positions of our disclosed membership organizations as a supplement to our 4th annual public policy and political contributions disclosureUpdated the sustainability data file accompanying this Report to include both 2022 data and additional years of historical data for certain metrics, enabling trend analysis over a longer time horizonUpdated our list of ""Further Reading"", showcasing the many additional NRG publications on sustainability-related topics to guide readers who wish to delve deeper into a particular subjectFinally, we incorporated our 13th year of sustainability reporting into this broader format Year-in-Review Report. In addition to covering the usual sustainability topics, this Report also describes NRG's corporate strategy and highlights the tight link to our sustainability strategy.As always, we welcome your feedback on our reporting and how it can be further improved.Second, we strengthened our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data gathering, methodology documentation, and reporting processes and controls. I asked NRG's Internal Audit team to review our current processes and identify improvement opportunities. We then worked closely with the responsible functional groups - Plant Operations, Environmental, Real Estate, and Supply Chain - to address the Internal Audit findings. We also kept our Board's Audit Committee informed on both the findings and their resolution throughout the process. I am very pleased with both the outcome - more robust GHG emissions reporting processes and controls - and with the collaboration we had across the Company and with our Board. We also continued to obtain third-party assurance of our GHG emissions reporting.Story continuesFinally, we continued to engage with many types of stakeholders - investors, customers, industry groups, academia, and government and non-government organizations - who are each working to advance some aspect of the energy transition. Our focus included decarbonization pathways (electrification, carbon capture, use, and storage, hydrogen, and reducing the carbon footprint of the natural gas supply chain), proposed sustainability reporting rules and standards, and the climate-tech start-up ecosystem, which we believe will help us identify technologies and partners that could help both NRG and our customers decarbonize.Q: What are you working on now that excites you most?A: Three inter-related areas:First, we continued to support our customers with the achievement of their sustainability goals. As described further in the Customers chapter of this Report, we continue to provide various sustainable products and services for both our residential and business customers:Renewable electricity including subscriptions customized for specific needs such as electric vehicle charging, integration with rooftop solar and storage systems, and community solarCertified carbon offsets and renewable electricity credits allowing customers to compensate for their consumption of natural gas, gasoline, and fossil fuel-fired electricityEnergy storage and resilience solutionsDemand-side solutions, including time-of-use plans and demand response programs that reward customers for using less electricitySustainability concierge and advisory services, including support for residential rooftop solar and storage systems, electric vehicle fast charger installation, and bespoke electricity and natural gas supply solutions for businessSecond, we recently acquired Vivint Smart Home, whose mission is to help customers create a more connected, energy-efficient, and safer home. Like NRG's suite of sustainable solutions, Vivint's portfolio encompasses both supply- and demand-side energy management offerings like rooftop solar (panels, batteries, and inverters), smart lighting, and smart thermostats. Whether used individually or together, these offerings help customers manage their energy consumption and can reduce their carbon footprints in the process. We are eager to integrate Vivint's portfolio and further expand the platform from which we can offer customers more choices over their energy - its source, type, quantity, and how and when it's consumed.Third, we recognize that recent acquisitions - including Direct Energy in 2021 and Vivint Smart Home in 2023 - have broadened NRG's business activities beyond electricity generation. As such, we are in the process of quantifying our Scope 3 GHG emissions - the emissions that we don't directly control, both upstream and downstream of NRG in our value chain. We are also quantifying the emissions we help customers avoid through their use of the sustainable products and services we provide them. When complete, this work will encompass both legacy NRG and Vivint sustainable products and services.Q: What keeps you up at night?A: Meeting our climate goals² - while also ensuring that the energy we provide to our customers remains both reliable and affordable, the so-called energy trilemma. For several years, these three imperatives were aligned with one another: over 2014-2022, our GHG emissions decreased by 42%, driven by a reduction in power generation and a market-driven shift away from coal-fired toward natural gas-fired generation. In 2022, however, our GHG emissions increased relative to 2021, driven by increased generation, which in turn was driven by power market conditions and weather. In particular, the price of natural gas increased relative to the price of coal in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war, making it more economic to generate electricity using coal relative to gas, and thereby increasing emissions.As a competitive energy provider, NRG competes for its customers every day. As such, we must serve the needs of customers that want to buy electricity, even when it has a relatively high carbon intensity. Moreover, there are rules governing the shutdown of power plants in the market. Even when NRG wishes to retire a fossil fuel-fired plant, we may be prevented from doing so for reliability reasons³. In addition to complying with these market rules, we have a fiduciary duty to preserve and enhance the financial performance of the Company.We actively monitor various options to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations and the electricity we provide to our customers. Ultimately, I believe that our technology-agnostic approach to decarbonization will ensure that we have access to the lowest-cost solutions when they are economic at scale. In the near-term, we remain committed to offering renewable electricity to those customers that demand it, and as discussed in the Environment chapter, we are aggressively pursuing renewable power purchase agreements with third-party developers so we can bring even more renewable electricity to our customers.¹Formerly known as Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics.²NRG's climate goals are to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2025 from the current 2014 base year and to achieve net zero by 2050. These goals encompass our directly controlled emissions (Scope 1), emissions from NRG's purchased electricity (Scope 2), and emissions from employee business travel (category 6 of Scope 3).³For example, in 2022 NRG continued to operate the 410 MW Indian River Unit 4 coal-fired plant under a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) agreement with independent system operator PJM. We had previously announced, in June 2021, our intention to shut down this facility. However, PJM identified reliability impacts resulting from the proposed deactivation. The RMR agreement is expected to end no later than December 31, 2026.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/nrg-energyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/766476/Commitment-to-Customers-Transparency-and-Decarbonization]"

Major stock indexes achieved several milestones during this period. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite exited the bear market and formed a new bull market in first-half 2023. The S&amp;P 500 recorded its best half in four years while the Nasdaq Composite posted its best first-half in 40 years.Consequently, most of the stocks surged during this period. This was a reversal from 2022, when most of the U.S. stocks plummeted as the pandemic-era fiscal incentives were withdrawn and the Fed pursued tight monetary control with rigorous increases in the benchmark interest rate.As a result, Wall Street started 2023 with an overall undervaluation of equity markets. The steady decline in the inflation rate from its peak on June 2022 and the Fed’s reduction of the magnitude of interest rate hike also favored U.S. stock markets.However, several stocks did not participate in dream rally of first-half 2023. Many of these stocks are set to roll in the second half. At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt;$40 billion) with negative returns in stock prices in the first half of 2023. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHoneywell International Inc. HON is benefiting from recovery in commercial flight hours and strength in advanced materials and UOP businesses. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and cost-control measures continue to drive HON’s top line. The company’s bullish forecast for 2023 holds promise. HON’s deal to acquire Compressor Controls will be beneficial going forward.Story continuesHoneywell International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.Humana Inc.’s HUM Medicaid business benefits from several contract wins and renewals, thereby contributing to its top line. Strategic buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth in the future. HUM’s revenues for 2023 are expected within $104.4-$106.4 billion.Solid contributions from the Insurance and CenterWell segments bode well for HUM. We expect Medicaid revenues to be $7.6 billion in 2023. Management estimates 2023 EPS to be at least $28.25, reflecting at least 11.9% growth year over year.Humana has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 11.8%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 0.4% over the last seven days.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP posted first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics improved year over year. Results have gained from continued brand strength and significant pricing.KDP has been witnessing continued momentum in the Refreshment Beverages segment for a long time. KDP witnessed market share expansion above 88% of its cold beverage portfolio. This mainly reflected strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks.Keurig Dr Pepper has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.6% and 10.9%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 2% over the last seven days.NextEra Energy Inc.

95,3fd1db3a-c4fe-3bc7-9a40-a22c5034db11,BK,2023-07-11,BNY Mellon (BK) Rides on Higher Rates Amid Rising Expenses,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-mellon-bk-rides-higher-150800917.html,1689001680,STORY,['BK'],"[The Bank Of New York Mellon’s BK revenues are likely to be supported by a global footprint, higher interest rates and a strong balance sheet position. Its capital deployment activities also seem impressive. However, mounting non-interest expenses and higher dependence on fee-based revenues are concerns.BNY Mellon has been witnessing decent improvement in net interest revenues (NIR) and net interest margin (NIM) ever since both rebounded solidly in 2022. The company’s NIR recorded a four-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2%. Likewise, NIM improved to 0.97% last year from 0.68% in 2021.With the Federal Reserve expected to keep rates high this year, BNY Mellon’s NIR and NIM are anticipated to keep improving, though a rise in funding costs is likely to weigh on it. Our estimates for NIR suggest a CAGR of 6.9% over the next three years. Further, NIM is expected to be 1.19% in 2023.BNY Mellon has a solid balance sheet. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had total debt of $59.6 billion, significantly lower than its cash and cash equivalents, and due from banks of $122.6 billion. Its investment-grade credit ratings maintain its favorable access to the debt market. Thus, the company will likely be able to continue meeting debt obligations in the near term, even if the economic situation worsens.BNY Mellon’s capital deployment activities seem impressive. Following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, the company intends to hike its quarterly cash dividend by 14% to 42 cents per share. It also has a share repurchase program, worth $5 billion, in place. As of Mar 31, 2023, nearly $3.7 billion worth of buyback authorization remained. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain efficient capital deployments.However, mounting non-interest expenses will likely hurt BNY Mellon’s bottom line. The company’s non-interest expenses have seen a four-year CAGR of 6.1% (ended 2022). Given the inflationary pressure and the company’s efforts to upgrade operations with updated technology, overall costs are expected to remain elevated. Excluding notable items, management anticipates 2023 expenses to increase approximately 4%. While we project non-interest expenses to decline this year, the metric is expected to increase 1.6% in 2024.BNY Mellon’s largest source of revenue is fee income, which constituted more than 74% of total revenues at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Concentration risk, emanating from higher dependence on fee-based revenues, could significantly alter the company’s financial position if there is any change in individual investment preferences, regulatory amendments, or a slowdown in capital market activities.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 6.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 0.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked bank stocks worth considering are Credicorp BAP and BOC Hong Kong BHKLY, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

96,b0d1549d-5ff2-315c-8abc-06bf236c2ce7,SPGI,2023-07-11,Ammonia Market to Triple by 2050 with Nearly All Growth Coming from Low-Carbon Supply,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ammonia-market-triple-2050-nearly-123000092.html,1689078600,STORY,['SPGI'],"[Global ammonia trade expected to increase ten-fold as demand for low-carbon ammonia used for shipping fuel and power generation transforms marketNEW YORK, July 11, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The global market for ammonia is poised to triple in the coming decades with nearly all of the growth coming from low-carbon ammonia, a new analysis by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights says. Driven by improved economics resulting from decarbonization policies, low-carbon ammonia is expected to grow from its current nascent state to 420 million tons—two thirds of the total market—by 2050.Global ammonia demand (excluding urea) to 2050. S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights""Decarbonization policies, including incentives in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, are transforming the economic fundamentals of low-carbon ammonia,"" said Sean Mulholland, Director, Agribusiness Consulting, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""The transition from concept to reality is already happening.""The new strategic report, Low-carbon Ammonia: Facilitating the Transition to a Sustainable Future says that the potential use of low-carbon ammonia as a marine bunker fuel, industry feedstock and as a carrier for hydrogen used in power generation represents a profound shift for the industry—from one geared primarily towards fertilizer production to one driven by energy markets.S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects global trade of ammonia to increase nearly ten times over by 2050 (160 million metric tons) as a result. While most ammonia is currently consumed on-site to produce other products that are then traded, low-carbon ammonia will more often be traded as a commodity in its own right. The Americas, the Middle East and Australia are expected to emerge as major exporters with Europe and East Asia emerging as major demand centers, the analysis says.""The rapid growth in ammonia driven by low-carbon supplies will change the current market beyond recognition,"" said Ryan Monis, Director, Chemical Consulting, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""The diversification of supply routes and demand applications will introduce carbon capture, renewables, power utility and shipping market participants to an industry currently dominated by fertilizer producers.""Story continuesThe current pipeline of low-carbon ammonia projects for power generation—with owners consisting of public utilities, oil and gas majors, investment funds and others—illustrates the shift towards a broader group of market participants, the analysis says. Joint ventures between renewable energy producers, hydrogen producers and ammonia producers can also be expected to emerge.While decarbonization policies have provided an irreversible momentum for low-carbon ammonia, several factors will be key in determining the ultimate composition of the market, the analysis says.S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects 'blue' ammonia (hydrocarbon-based production coupled with carbon capture and storage) to be more economically attractive than conventional production in some key markets before 2030 due to a combination of carbon emissions penalties and production subsidies. However, 'green' ammonia (produced from renewable electricity) will require further policy support beyond the incentives already announced to make it cost competitive in most markets.Other points of high potential impact on the development of the market include the development of certification and classification systems to harmonize international trade; greater clarity from some major markets regarding acceptable emissions thresholds for hydrogen and ammonia in their decarbonization plans; and the pace of innovation and efficiency improvements for ammonia's use in power generation, the analysis says.""Despite some policy and technological uncertainties remaining, it is now clear that the fundamental economics of low-carbon ammonia have been transformed,"" said Monis. ""We expect the number of projects reaching Final Investment Decisions to accelerate significantly in the coming years, not only in production capacity but also in the associated infrastructure required to take the low-carbon ammonia market from concept to reality.""In addition to the new strategic report, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights has also introduced a new Monthly Low-carbon Ammonia Report service. Produced by Fertecon, the fertilizer analysis team at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights and the leading provider of data and insights for ammonia for more than 40 years, the new monthly report offers a regular and recurring market analysis that provides business intelligence and short-term forecasts for the low-carbon ammonia market as an individual sector.

The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up roughly 40% year-to-date (YTD). This benchmark contains the top tech companies, but not every company in the index is up 40% YTD. Top winners like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have outsized presence in the index and played more of a role in the YTD gains. However, some of the undervalued tech stocks that didn’t contribute to the increase, or even dragged down the QQQ, still look promising. Some investors zig when the market zags and look for the under the radar opportunities that are present in every market. These three cheap stocks fit the bill and look primed to bounce back.Cisco (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall. undervalued tech stocksSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has been one of the few reliable undervalued tech stocks in recent decades. The company’s 18 P/E ratio reflects this truth and the 3% dividend yield also gives you cash flow as you wait for shares to appreciate. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCisco shares are only up by about 8% YTD, which makes it a far cry from the 40% jump in QQQ shares. However, Cisco reported 14% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and a 6% YoY net income increase in the most recent earnings report.Scott Herren, CFO of Cisco, mentioned the company’s healthy backlog and recurring revenue streams as catalysts for raised guidance for FY 2023. If Cisco continues to report several quarters of double-digit revenue growth and healthy profit margins, the stock has potential for a rally. An 18 P/E ratio gives the company plenty of room to expand with the revenue potential from its software and security services. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs. undervalued tech stocksSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.comThe advertising giant has performed well to start the year. Shares are up by over 34% YTD, which slightly trails QQQ. While this can be viewed as a successful year, peers have left Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the dust. Despite reporting worse numbers in revenue and earnings, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares are up by 130% YTD. Meta Platforms has a 36 P/E ratio, while Alphabet has a 27 P/E ratio.Story continuesInvestors can also look at Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) which has increased by 57% YTD. In Roku’s latest earnings report, the company reported 1% YoY revenue growth and a net loss of $193 million. That’s far more than the $26 million net loss Roku reported in Q1 2022. It doesn’t make much sense for these companies to have higher valuations and more success in the stock market this year than Alphabet. Either Meta Platforms and Roku are due for declines, or Alphabet is due for a rally. Both scenarios are also possible. Meanwhile, Alphabet reported 3% YoY revenue growth and a net income decline of 8.4% YoY. Both of those numbers are more impressive than what investors found in the earning reports from Meta Platforms and Roku, making Alphabet one of the undervalued tech stocks to buy.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor company. undervalued tech stocksSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is only up 11% YTD, despite the company’s position as an artificial intelligence (AI) chip maker. The P/E ratio of 13 makes the company worth a closer look, and investors get to collect dividends while they wait for the price to rise. Qualcomm recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.75 to $0.80, representing a 6.67% YoY increase. The company’s low valuation and underperformance can be explained by its two recent subpar earnings reports. In the most recent report, Qualcomm reported a 16% YoY revenue decrease and a net income decrease of 41.9%. Qualcomm’s CEO emphasized that the company is focusing on driving long-term value, despite navigating in the currently tumultuous environment.Qualcomm has maintained solid profit margins for a while and has continued that trend in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company’s valuation and growth potential from artificial intelligence make it a cheap tech stock to consider.On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in QCOM.

Space Systems Command, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA, has awarded the deal.Valued at $42.8 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by Jul 31, 2026. The latest modification deal brings the total cumulative face value of the contract to $1.98 billion. The work related to the deal will be executed at Redondo Beach, CA.What’s Favoring Northrop Grumman?A strong defense structure acts as a deterrent against potential threats. The need to strengthen a nation’s defense structure has thrived the demand for technologically advanced orbital assets strategically designed for missile interception and recognition. In such a scenario, NOC’s technologically advanced products act as a cornerstone for military surveillance.Northrop’s OPIR polar-orbiting satellites, known as NextGen Polar (NGP), operate in highly-elliptical orbits and enhance the missile-warning mission into a more capable next generation. Their modernized sensors provide excellent coverage of the entire northern hemisphere and are fitted with new resiliency features to stay in the fight in contested scenarios. NGP’s enhanced communication system allows to transmit wide-band OPIR data to the ground.Such advanced technology in detecting emerging missile threats assists the company in witnessing a steady inflow of orders, like the latest one. This should boost the revenue generation prospects of NOC from the Space Systems business unit.Growth ProspectsPer a report published by Mordor Intelligence, the military satellite market is projected to witness a CAGR of 6% during the 2023-2028 period. This should benefit Northrop and prominent defense majors like The Boeing Company BA, Lockheed Martin LMT and Raytheon Technologies RTX that are engaged in offering satellite surveillance.Story continuesBoeing delivers satellite and ground solutions that support government customers’ national security operations, including intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and communications. The company is the prime contractor for the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle — the most advanced un-crewed re-entry spacecraft used by the U.S. Department of the Air Force to perform risk-reduction and experimentation for reusable space vehicle technologies.Boeing has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. Its investors have gained 54.8% in the past month.Raytheon provides end-to-end space solutions, ranging from ground control systems to on-orbit sensors to keep customers informed and ahead of the threat. Its Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution Mission Data Processing Application Framework generates warnings, alerts and other information for combatants.The long-term growth rate of Raytheon is projected at 8.3%. Its shares have increased 2.8% in the past year.Lockheed Martin uses cutting-edge technologies to build capabilities that comprise layered defense systems, from missile defense to directed energy and hypersonic capabilities. Its Mobile User Objective System offers secure ultra-high-frequency satellite communications for mobile forces, whereas its latest Space Based Infrared System satellite plays a critical role in detecting missile threats and improving resiliency against attacks for the United States.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

Satterley said the pain and suffering damages should be much larger than the medical costs.The U.S. Supreme Court has found that punitive damages should generally be no more than nine times compensatory damages, and that a higher ratio can be reduced on appeal as excessive.J&amp;J's lawyers told the jury Monday that there was no evidence presented at the trial linking Hernandez's cancer to talc, and that the company had always gone out of its way to test its talc and ensure its safety.""What is remarkable from a party that has the burden of proof is that they didn't test any bottle (he) claims to have used"" for asbestos, attorney Allison Brown said.When the plaintiff's doctors looked for asbestos in his body, she said, ""they found none - not one fiber of asbestos.""The jury is expected to begin deliberating Tuesday.Hernandez, 24, said in his lawsuit that he developed mesothelioma in the tissue around his heart as a result of exposure to J&amp;J's talc products beginning when he was a baby.Tens of thousands of plaintiffs have sued, alleging that J&amp;J's baby powder and other talc products sometimes contained asbestos and caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&amp;J has said its talc products are safe and do not contain asbestos, which has been linked to mesothelioma.Story continuesJ&amp;J subsidiary LTL Management in April filed for bankruptcy in Trenton, New Jersey, proposing to pay $8.9 billion to settle more than 38,000 lawsuits and prevent new cases from coming forward. It was the company's second attempt to resolve talc claims in bankruptcy, after a federal appeals court rejected an earlier bid.Most litigation has been halted during bankruptcy proceedings, but U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan, who is overseeing LTL's Chapter 11, let Hernandez's trial proceed because he is expected to live only a short time.Asbestos plaintiffs are seeking to have LTL's latest bankruptcy filing dismissed. They have argued the filing was brought in bad faith to insulate the company from litigation.J&amp;J and LTL have argued that bankruptcy delivers settlement payouts to plaintiffs more fairly, efficiently and equitably than trial courts, which they have likened to a ""lottery"" in which some litigants get large awards and others nothing.J&amp;J said in bankruptcy court filings that the costs of its talc-related verdicts, settlements and legal fees have reached about $4.5 billion.(Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Will Dunham, Alexia Garamfalvi and Lisa Shumaker)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis on poverty in the United States, and head over directly to the 10 States with the Lowest Poverty Rates in America.Poverty rate in the United States has continued to steadily decline over the last decade. 11.2% of the population lived below the poverty line, $27,479 for a family of four, in 2021, compared to 14.8% in 2011, according to the Census Bureau. In terms of demographics, communities most affected by poverty in order are the Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics. Similarly, geographically, there are states that are poorer than some of their wealthy counterparts.New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate in the US among all 50 states. It is followed by Minnesota and New Jersey at second and third on the list of states with the lowest poverty rates. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Mississippi is the poorest state in the US having the highest poverty in the country with a population of 18.1% living below the poverty line.The United States is divided by its stark income inequality. One factor why poverty rates are low in some states compared to others is significant corporate presence in these states which leads to production of jobs and economic opportunity. This factor also indicates that these states are business friendly and have optimal economic policies in place.Maryland is one example. It is not just among the states with the lowest poverty rates, but is also one of the wealthiest states in America in terms of household income. There are at least 10 billionaires and more than 220,000 millionaires in the state.The world's largest hotel chain, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. It has over a 100 hotels in the state of Maryland, providing employment to thousands of residents in the hospitality industry. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) reported a net income of $757 million in the first quarter of 2023, earing $2.43 per share.Story continuesLikewise, the state of New Jersey is home to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a leading American multinational corporation that produces pharmaceutical, medical, and consumer packaged goods, and is a source of employment for the local community. It was founded in 1886 in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where it still has its corporate head office. The consumer division of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is located in Skillman. The company is part of the Fortune 500 list of companies in the US having the highest revenue. Merck, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Cognizant are other prominent companies that are headquartered in the state, and contribute to the region's economic success.Virginia, which is in our list of states with the lowest poverty rates, has some of the biggest defense companies based in the state. One of them being the aerospace and armament manufacturer, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) which is headquartered in Reston. It is one of the largest defense contractors of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had a revenue of close to $40 billion, and received more than $21 billion in DoD contracts. You can read more about the biggest companies in Virginia in our article here.At the same time, several corporations such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) are also undertaking voluntary initiatives to accelerate economic growth in areas with high poverty rates. TechSpark, a program launched by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), to provide digital access and skills to residents of rural areas has enabled 88% of the schools in Northeast Wisconsin to offer Computer Sciences education, which bodes well for their future career prospects.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Employee Giving Program, which started in 2011 has already raised $880 million for people going through difficult times such as stress, poverty, or violence. The company matches dollar payments contributed by its employees in this cause, and also raises money in the pool for every hour volunteered by an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee to help those in need.Another fine example is that of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), which is one of the leading financial institutions in the United States. In 2021, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) announced to spend $15 million in collaboration with a non-profit organization named ideas42 to help alleviate cost burdens and foster economic activities in regions regarded as middle or low income.MethodologyWe have used U.S. Census Bureau's three-year average poverty rates between 2019-2021 to rank the states with the lowest poverty rates in America. This is the latest official data available on the subject. In the case of poverty rates being equal for two or more states, the percentage change in poverty rates from the last census, which covered poverty data between 2018-2020, were used to act as a tiebreaker to rank one over the other.25 States With The Lowest Poverty Rates In AmericaDW labs Incorporated/Shutterstock.comLet's now head over to the list of states with the lowest poverty rates in America.25.

109,25944f40-b12a-378f-a85a-c46d872facd5,MDT,2023-07-11,Is Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-nyse-mdt-risky-investment-110114256.html,1689073274,STORY,['MDT'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Medtronic How Much Debt Does Medtronic Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Medtronic had US$24.3b in debt in April 2023; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$7.96b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$16.3b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Medtronic's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Medtronic had liabilities of US$9.05b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$30.2b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$7.96b as well as receivables valued at US$6.00b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$25.3b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Medtronic has a huge market capitalization of US$115.0b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Medtronic's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 22.7 times, makes us even more comfortable. The bad news is that Medtronic saw its EBIT decline by 17% over the last year. If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Medtronic's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Medtronic generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 86% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewHappily, Medtronic's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its EBIT growth rate. It's also worth noting that Medtronic is in the Medical Equipment industry, which is often considered to be quite defensive. All these things considered, it appears that Medtronic can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Medtronic  that you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The first plane is due to be completed in late 2023 for delivery next year.Its opening comes as competition between Airbus and arch-rival Boeing shifts towards production strategy, with both companies struggling to deliver on bulging order books.The new line sits along one edge of the world's second-largest building by usable space, supported by automated stores where robotic pickers will select parts and tools for workers. Other robots will be used to join part of the upper fuselage.HIGHER OUTPUTThe facility is part of efforts to lift total A320-family output to 75 a month in 2026 from an estimated 45 now. Some suppliers have called the target ambitious.Story continuesIn an effort to expand automation and cut costs, an existing A320-family line is expected to move to a vacant bay in the Lagardere hall from its nearby current facility, where Concorde was built. Boeing too is reallocating space to small jets.Monday's ceremony came days after Airbus posted data showing the A321neo had become its most-sold model with more than 5,000 orders, surpassing the original A320 sister version.Environmental critics say burgeoning sales of the current generation of jets will make it harder to meet climate goals.Le Maire told Reuters aircraft like the A321 still offered significant savings in emissions compared to jets they replace.Monday's ceremony contrasted with the lavish sound-and-light show in front of European leaders in 2005, when the A380 was unveiled to huge fanfare as a symbol of European economic might.Almost 20 years on, smaller medium-haul workhorse jets generate the bulk of industry profits. Production of the A380 superjumbo ended two years ago, followed by Boeing's 747.The ghost of the A380 is not entirely laid to rest, however.A walled-off area in the rest of the plant is being re-used for an 18-month programme of A380 inspections and repairs after cracks emerged in some wing parts, Reuters reported on Friday.

Iron ore prices had earlier lost steam on weak demand in China due to the slump in property investment while supply prospects remained strong.However, the possibility that the Chinese government will provide stimulus measures for its construction sector has helped lift up iron ore prices lately. Going forward, iron ore prices are expected to be supported by demand in the automotive sector, infrastructure and housing market.Copper and nickel prices will also be fueled by growing demand for electric vehicles.  BHP's investment in growth projects with focus on commodities like copper, nickel and potash will aid growth. Its efforts to make operations more efficient through technology adoption will drive earnings.(You can read the full research report on BHP Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AstraZeneca shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-0.4% vs. +8.6%). The company's diabetes franchise faces stiff competition while pricing pressure hurts sales in the respiratory unit. Sales are slowing down in its key market, China. Estimate movements have been mixed ahead of Q2 results.Nevertheless, AstraZeneca has reported impressive earnings surprise in recent quarters. Its key drugs, mainly cancer medicines, Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi should keep driving revenues. Its pipeline is strong with several phase III data readouts lined up for 2023.It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets.

Lately, the company has been witnessing a solid recovery in its commercial business.During the first quarter, the company booked 107 net commercial airplane orders. The U.S. government's inclination toward strengthening the nation's defense system should also boost Boeing's growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term.However, its 737 MAX program remains a cause of concern in China, thereby impacting its expectation of delivery timing and future gradual production rate increases.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) act as middlemen for employers and health plans. They negotiate rebates and fees with drug manufacturers, and create lists, or formularies, of medications that are covered by insurance, and reimburse pharmacies for patients' prescriptions.Express did not respond to requests for comment on whether patients would have the same access to Sandoz's lower-priced biosimilar as the much more expensive near copies of Humira on its formulary.Robert Popovian, the chief science policy officer at patient advocacy group Global Healthy Living Foundation, said if Cigna puts Sandoz's unbranded version on a different tier to the other biosimilars, patients might have to pay higher out-of-pocket costs for the drug or meet some additional criteria.The drugs, which became available this month, add to U.S. competition for Humira that began in January with the launch of Amgen's Amjevita, which is already on Express Scripts' reimbursement list.Story continuesUnitedHealth Group's PBM unit Optum RX announced in June that it would cover the two Humira biosimilars from Sandoz alongside Boehringer’s Cyltezo and Amgen’s Amjevita on its reimbursement list.Unlike generic versions of pills, complex biotech drugs made from living cells cannot be exactly copied, thus the term biosimilar. They typically come with less of a discount off the branded drug than traditional generics.Organon, Coherus BioSciences and South Korea's Celltrion have also launched Humira biosimilars.

LOUIS, July 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business of The Cigna Group's (NYSE: CI) Evernorth, announced today that as part of its commitment to driving greater affordability for clients and people living with inflammatory conditions, it will add three additional biosimilars to its National Preferred Formulary (NPF). The addition of these products that offer competitive net costs to HUMIRA, the top selling pharmaceutical drug in the world, will also support greater patient access and choice.(PRNewsfoto/Express Scripts)""In any industry, competition often leads to lower prices, and until recently, HUMIRA had little competition. Since it was introduced, its list price increased by 470%, and by adding multiple clinically-equivalent, cost-effective biosimilars to our formulary, we can now use the opportunity created by competition to drive greater savings for our clients and the nearly 100 million Americans we serve,"" said Adam Kautzner, Pharm.D., President of Express Scripts. ""Embracing biosimilars as they come to market builds on our efforts over the past decade to support greater adoption, just as we did when generics first became available over 30 years ago. We believe that, like generic medications, biosimilars can drive greater affordability for individuals with chronic and complex conditions who need it most.""Express Scripts will prefer the following biosimilar products on its NPF, offering competitive alternatives to HUMIRA (adalimumab):Story continuesCyltezo (adalimumab-adbm) (Boehringer Ingelheim), the first interchangeable biosimilar with HUMIRA, low concentration formulationAdalimumab-adaz (Sandoz), high-concentration formulation, unbrandedHyrimoz (Sandoz), high-concentration formulationBiosimilars for inflammatory conditions have the potential to reshape the specialty medicine landscape. According to Express Scripts trend data, inflammatory medications represented nearly 25% of total drug spend across its commercial book of business in 2022. Evernorth analysis further estimates that competition created with biosimilars can save the U.S. $225 billion to $375 billion in total pharmacy spend over the next decade.""Our formulary decision process is guided by clinical effectiveness first and foremost, while also considering the needs and continuity of care for patients, in addition to competitive cost savings to our clients. Our decision to add the Sandoz products, as well as the interchangeable product Cyltezo, to our NPF supports greater affordability across this entire treatment class. We gladly welcome new biosimilar options and pricing strategies that enable us to effectively lower net costs and deliver long-term value, whether it's by lower list prices or deeper discounts for our clients and patients,"" said Harold Carter, Chief Pharma Trade Relations Officer, Express Scripts.Express Scripts has long advocated for greater adoption of biosimilars because the competition they bring to the market enables pharmacy benefits strategies that will drive greater access and savings for plan sponsors and members. Preferred formulary placement is one tool to encourage the use of more clinically sound and cost-effective products (including certain biosimilars). For example, Express Scripts added Semglee, the first FDA-approved interchangeable biosimilar basal insulin, to its NPF beginning in 2022. In doing so, the company estimates more than $20 million savings for plan sponsors in one year.The biosimilar Amjevita (Amgen), citrate-free, low concentration formulation, is currently preferred on the Express Scripts NPF and the National Preferred Flex Formulary for 2023. Express Scripts will continue to conduct individual reviews of new biosimilar products as they become available to ensure each product meets the clinical standards required for formulary placement – in addition to cost-savings. The company is also committed to supporting the market transition to biosimilars, while preserving choice and flexibility for patients.About Evernorth Health Services Evernorth Health Services creates pharmacy, care and benefits solutions to improve health and increase vitality.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$46.27 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$42.32. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Wells Fargo shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$112m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Wells Fargo insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research at Argus Research, tells Yahoo Finance what is he expecting to hear from banks this quarter.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Tougher capital rules for US banks proposed by the Fed's Barr isn't the only thing that investors are closely watching. Earnings season is just around the corner. And the nation's largest banks are gearing up to report their quarterly results. Here with more on what we can expect, we want to bring in Stephen Biggar, Director of Financial Services Research for Argus Research.Stephen, it's good to see you. So certainly, a challenging set up here for the banks, a higher interest rate environment. We have also the possibility here of stricter regulations. And the implications of that is something that investors are waiting to see. How does this set us up for this round of earnings season?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, so, well, I think it's going to be, you know, not banks' finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter. Clearly, the higher rate environment that was very helpful in 2022 for net interest margins is having a detrimental effect now. You've got slowing loan growth, just less demand as you have much higher interest rates here. And that's the intended effect of the Federal Reserve.Net interest margins, it looks like they peaked in the fourth quarter of last year. We're likely to see additional pressure sequentially on margins as deposit rates have really increased quite a bit here as banks try to stay competitive with a lot of higher-yielding alternatives out there. And then, of course, on the other bit of lending, the business would be loss provisions.And, you know, we're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market. So I think banks are going to be conservative here, add to loan loss provisions. And all in all, of course, all three of those will dampen earnings growth a little bit for the quarter.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: So you talk about the growth we're likely to see in loan losses, defaults in credit card payments. But we've heard repeatedly about the potential cliff waiting, especially in commercial real estate. What are you going to be looking for, at least in this quarter, in terms of the potential rising risk on that front for banks?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, definitely, the commercial real estate does, you know, loom as a potential problem area. And we've seen some defaults already kind of pick up there. You know, I think banks did a very good job in the first quarter of laying out the risks there.Typically, for the very large banks, commercial real estate is about 10% of their loan book. Commercial and the office space in particular, which is where a lot of the damage is and the higher delinquency rates, is typically more like, you know, 3% to 4%. It's quite a bit higher, about double that, at the regional bank level, but still, you know, manageable at this point.And of course, the underwriting standards have been better in commercial real estate than they were 5 or 10 or 15 years ago. So that's beneficial for banks. They have generally about a 40-- or 60, I should say, 60% loan to value in there. And, you know, that gives them a fair amount of leeway should these go south.But clearly, a lot of refinancings are coming due in the commercial real estate space over the next three years and definitely among the highest problem areas that we're watching in terms of delinquencies and credit quality.SEANA SMITH: Stephen, we know a lot of the focus in past earnings season most recently have been on guidance. We've already seen a number of the banks, specifically the regionals, already lower their guidance. M&amp;T Bank was one of those names that already lowered their forecast. Do you think we'll see further cuts here over the next several weeks?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Well, I would say, I mean, given that we have earnings coming out at the end of the week, banks have gone into a quiet period. We're probably not going to see additional drop here. A lot of that softer guidance came out during some of the conferences they had at the investment bank. So I think we're, you know, sort of set for the quarter here now that the quarter has ended.But, you know, I think the commentary and the guidance on the earnings calls that we get is probably not going to be a barn burner either, right? We're probably going to, you know, see more of the same banks sort of coming into the last quarter. Actually, some of them were expecting that the Fed would have been done raising interest rates, you know, by mid-year.That looks not to be the case as you look three months later now. Some had expected even a cut by the end of the year. That seems very much off the table now. So I think we're stuck with these higher rates, which will, again, dampen lending growth and slow the economy further, which is bad for credit quality.AKIKO FUJITA: Stephen, it's still a big concern that the regional lenders, the medium-sized banks-- we have seen in the spring, there was, like, JPMorgan swallowing up First Republic. I mean, when you look at the financial space right now, are you expecting more consolidation, you know, not necessarily failed banks, but just seeing where the banks are, especially the medium-sized banks, and the impact they're continuing to take from higher rates?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, I think-- and, you know, we've seen some support at the regulatory level. There might be some appetite for additional consolidation. I think, you know, most would say it's safe to say we're overbanked in the US. Particularly relative to other countries, we've got about 4,700 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the US today.They all can't make it, I would say, in this environment. I think it, you know, behooves most of them to take a look at partnerships and outright acquisitions if they can't do it themselves. That's tough for a bank, obviously, that wants to maintain its independence, you know, they feel they have the right product set for their local markets, and so forth.But the regulatory aspects here, what happens with the new-- particularly the regulations that are going to be put in place, it's going to make it very hard for banks to compete, for banks to continually elevate. You know, we know that capital cushions only go in one direction, right? And that's up. So they continually have to add more to the capital.Even as they grow larger, you would say it's counterintuitive that the larger banks have to set aside even more. But it doesn't make them safer. It makes them, you know, less prone to failure, certainly, and looks better in the eye of the regulators. So I think we'll see more consolidation here. I don't think we're going to have the number of banks over the next five or 10 years, but I think there's a lot of consolidation that needs to take place.SEANA SMITH: And, Stephen, what is the timeline of that consolidation? Is it something that's going to take years to play out?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Yeah, absolutely. I don't think we're-- you know, banks can only take on so much at a time. The large banks, when they do acquisitions that are sizable, I would say, about 1/3 of their asset base or higher, they tend to take about a year and a half to do that before they even can look at something even more significant. Smaller size or sort of token acquisitions that are in the same service territory, that makes sense. Maybe they can do that a little faster.But yeah, we're talking years here and not just a couple of quarters, obviously. You know, it took about 20 years for banks to have the number of banks that we have in the US. And it's probably going to take another 20, unless we get some, you know, very favorable regulatory environment that actually encourages consolidation. And I don't see that happening.SEANA SMITH: So, Stephen, given all this, given the very challenging sort of backdrop that we're in right now, who is best positioned in this environment?STEPHEN BIGGAR: Well, it'll still favor of the large banks, the JPMorgans, Bank of Americas, even Morgan Stanley, and some of the super regionals, I would say, like the Truist Financial, PNC Financial, U.S. Bancorp. These are banks that have already largely met the-- or can more easily meet the higher capital requirements. It will take them a matter of quarters, let's say, to no more than two years to reach these higher capital levels that are most likely to be in place.And we do expect, of course, the banks to sail through this year's stress test. The CICA results came in, but those are going to get more stringent going forward. We're going to have a scenario where interest rates spike over the forecast period versus decline, which has been the way it's worked with stress tests in the past.The Basel III international regulations are going to get more strict and severe as well. They're going to add a couple of more nuances to scenarios and what happens with banks, in particular about risk weighted assets and trading assets as well. So that will affect the Morgan Stanley's and Goldman Sachs of the world in particular. So I think those are still well positioned.Banks in the kind of $100 billion to $250 billion range or even $50 on their way to $100 billion are really going to have, you know, a tougher time. So I'd stick with the larger banks. They've got great earnings potential here. They're well diversified. They've got good yields at this point.And of course, many of these have suffered in the decline. They're well underperforming the market at this point. And that'll create some opportunities for investors.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, we'll start seeing these quarterly results later on this week. Stephen Biggar of Argus Research, thank you so much.STEPHEN BIGGAR: Thank you.]"

All had more than $100 billion in assets at the time of the failures.The proposals will surely face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.Barr said the proposed changes from the Fed would principally raise capital requirements for the largest, most complex banks. The biggest institutions could be asked to hold an additional 2 percentage points of capital — or an additional $2 of capital for every $100 of risk-weighted assets.He said that most banks already have enough capital to meet the new standards and estimated that banks would be able to build the required capital through retained earnings in less than two years — even while maintaining their dividends.Barr said he will not recommend fundamental changes to three capital ratios that apply to the nation’s largest banks — a surcharge as well as a countercyclical capital buffer and enhanced supplementary leverage ratio.Federal Reserve Board of Governors Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)One change that could affect regional banks is that any with more than $100 billion in assets would have to count any unrealized available-for-sale securities losses against their regulatory capital.Story continuesYears ago, US supervisors decided most small and mid-sized institutions could opt out of deducting paper losses on bonds from key regulatory capital levels.In essence, these banks were allowed to report assets that were stronger in theory than they would be in practice. As Silicon Valley Bank — and the broader investing public — found out in March.“If the bank had already been required to include those losses in its reported capital, it is less likely that the market and depositors would have reacted the same way,” Barr said Monday.Only banks with more than $700 billion in assets are currently required to count these unrealized losses against their regulatory capital levels. That includes giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC).Capital, also known as ""equity,"" is what allows a bank to absorb any changes in the value of its assets and survive unexpected shocks. Regulators require banks to keep key capital ratios above certain thresholds. These ratios go up if a bank earns more profits and down if it loses money on loans or investments.If these ratios aren't high enough, the thinking goes, a bank could run into serious problems during times of stress.Barr on Monday also called for another change that could affect regional banks: a long-term debt requirement for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets. That would also expand the group of institutions that have to follow those rules.“Long-term debt improves the ability of a bank to be resolved upon failure because the long-term debt can be converted to equity and used to absorb losses,” said Barr.Barr is also proposing ending the practice of relying on banks’ own individual estimates of their own risk, noting that banks tend to underestimate their credit risk.The rules would also adjust the way that banks measure market risk — the risk of losses from movements in interest rates, stock prices, foreign exchange, and commodities risk.Banks would also be required to model risk at the level of individual trading desks for particular asset classes, instead of at the firm level, acting to raise capital used to protect against market risks.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Joining us now to cover all of it, Yahoo Finance reporters Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal. Josh, let's start with you. Give us the calendar here. What's on the docket?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, we got a more full calendar this week, guys. I'm excited about the calendar this week. Some weeks, we come in and we're not fired up about the calendar. We're fired up about this calendar because it's the start of earnings season.Right now, we're looking at the economic calendar right there. You can see you have the Fed Beige Book on Wednesday, CPI also on Wednesday, and then of course, consumer sentiment, the first reading of that University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment for July, expected on Friday. But I'm really fired up for earnings season to start too. We have bank earnings on Friday, and then you also have Delta reporting on Thursday, and Pepsi also expected to report on Thursday.But I think a key theme when you think about this week is really what have the interest rate hikes started to do to the economy. And when you think about what have they started to do to the financial system, how are they dealing with those high interest rates, and then how are they impacting inflation and CPI. Allie, I know that's something you've been following closely. Looks like those headline numbers are sort of expected to fall pretty heavily in that report on Wednesday.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, inflation expected to slow down, but it will still remain significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That along with the strong jobs report that we got on Friday, which showed unemployment low, wages high suggests that there will be more rate hikes to come. So here are the expected CPI numbers according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesWe see headline inflation expected to have risen 3.1% on a year over year basis in June. That is a slowdown from May's 4% rise with monthly inflation expected to tick up to 0.3%. Then if we take a look at core inflation, that strips out the more volatile pricing of food and gas. That's expected to have a yearly rise of 5%. Yet another slowdown compared to May with monthly core prices hitting 0.3%.According to a new note from Citi, the slowdown is expected to come from two things-- the deceleration of shelter pricing, which has long been expected, along with a decline in used car prices. That has remained stubbornly high. But we're expected to see that come down in this print and continue to come down through the back half of 2023 and into 2024. But again, guys, this is not enough to convince the Fed to pull back on those rate hikes.All the analyst notes that I've been reading pretty much expect on that Fed meeting on July 26 that they will raise rates by another 25 basis points. Markets are pricing this in as well. Data from CME group has about a 93% chance of that. And there is some expectation that we could see more rate hikes through November. But that's all going to depend on the data.The Fed has consistently said it's data dependent. CPI is a critical part of that data set. So we shall see.- By the way, we said nothing of note-- WD-40 reports after the close today. I'll be curious to see how they do. I'm not even kidding.JOSH SCHAFER: Good consumer brand.- Good consumer brand. I mean, one of the things I'm going to be watching really closely that kind of brings the earnings and the inflation stories together is last quarter, we heard so many companies-- Pepsi is one that stands out to me in particular-- where the volumes weren't very impressive, but they were managing to get those price increases through. So I think it's going to be really key this quarter to hear if that is still happening.JOSH SCHAFER: Can you still get the price increases through with inflation coming down? At what point does the consumer say, wait, inflation is coming down, I'm reading headlines that headline inflation is coming down, why am I still paying--- Well, it's a chicken and egg situation. Headline inflation is decelerating because they're not able to raise the prices in the last year. And then when you're a consumer and you see the news that inflation is starting to decelerate, then you say, wait, why am I still paying. And then it hopefully starts to--JOSH SCHAFER: And then if I'm a company, what does that do to my margins because am I still paying those inflationary prices and not being able to pass it on to the consumer? That's a big thing some of the analysts--- So that feeds into the magic word this earnings season, at least from the perspective of Peter Tchir who we had on earlier-- last earnings season, it was all about how many people could say artificial intelligence so many different ways, but how many different ways can companies say resiliency this earnings season. And that's going to be something that, at least from Peter Tchir who gave us that earlier today, could be the type of magical phrase or talking point or word that we hear this earnings season.- We'll see.- Yes, we will. Thank you so much for joining us, Allie Canal and Josh Schafer here this morning.]"

Yahoo Finance Live examines the stock action surrounding these two trending stocks.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Novavax surging after the biotech company saying that it will receive $350 million from Canada to settle a fortified-- forfeited, excuse me, vaccine doses that were previously scheduled to be delivered here. But, Akiko, we might be seeing a brief bounce here in the stock today because we know Novavax has raised some red flags just about the viability of their business, their ability to continue making revenue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, given the fact that demand for vaccines is down. And this is the only product that they have brought here to consumers.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, the only product in what? 35 years, one out there. I mean, so, you know, a 30% bounce there, but, you know, worth noting that Canada can essentially terminate this contract with Novavax if they don't necessarily get regulatory approval for some of the production there. So there's still some question marks around it, but, you know, hey, the 30% jump, at least for one day, certainly welcome news for investors of Novavax.Fox stock hit with a downgrade from Wells Fargo over ecosystem risk surrounding Fox News. Shares there are down more than 1% here. There's a number of factors here at play, Seana. There's the cord cutting, number one, which is something that we have seen a lot of cable outlets have to deal with.There is also that the face of the network really shifting with Tucker Carlson leaving, or at least getting the boot. And so, you know, I mean, how do we read this stock? It's tough to say how much of this is Fox-specific, how much of it is a broader trend that we're seeing. How do you break it down?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think it's almost more of a broader trend that we are seeing when it comes to cord cutting because the fact that we're still up 11% year to date, given the fact that Tucker Carlson did leave. I think a lot of people have almost moved beyond that. And we have seen Fox News depart with some of its biggest names in the past.They are largely able to keep their base, keep the very, very loyal fans that they have. So I think that the broader issue with Fox going forward is the ongoing cord cutting and what that exactly looks like, how that is reshaping the industry as a whole. And when it comes to those ecosystem risks that Cahill was talking about in this report, he was just focusing on the fact that most of Fox's earnings are a result of Fox News earnings.So when anything happens there, it could potentially pressure the company going forward. Obviously, cord cutting, a massive issue here and something that they are not alone with in trying to figure out how exactly to best deal with this and shift their consumer base to online.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of why Gen Z are a digital native generation, the purchasing power of Gen Z, products Gen Z use the most, what Gen Z want from brands, how to market to Gen Z in 2023, and Gen Z product trends for 2023, and go directly to Gen Z’s 10 Favorite Brands in 2023.  Social scientists have studied generations, in theory and more practically, for millennia. More recently, philosophers like Auguste Comte have argued that generational change is the engine behind social change. More specifically, each generation entering into a new life stage at more or less the same time is the pulse that creates the history of our society. Specific major-scale events can also change the outlook of a generation, and are often reflected in how they’re named. The Greatest Generation is known for the heroic sacrifices they made during World War ll. The Baby Boomers, in turn, had their outlook colored by the Vietnam War and the social upheavals of the ‘60s. More recently, Millennials’ worldviews have been shaped by the events of 9/11 and the proliferation of the internet. Digital Natives:Similarly, Gen Z have been born in an age when the internet has achieved widespread use and is a part of our everyday lives, making them the real ‘digital natives’. The ‘Zoomers’ are a super-informed generation who turn to the internet for any kind of information and for work, shopping, dating, entertainment, and making friends online. They have grown up in a time of rapid globalization, when various media and technologies have significantly accelerated social interaction and cultural exchange around the world. Purchasing Power of Gen Z:Born between 1996 and 2010, Generation Z are not kids anymore. In fact, they’re the new generation of consumers that big brands, small and medium businesses, and marketers need to think about. With an estimated collective buying power of $463 billion in the U.S. alone, and $853 billion globally, business owners and marketers are starting to pay attention. Story continuesProducts Gen Z Use the Most:According to Klarna, the products that Gen Z shoppers spend on the most are clothing and shoes, groceries, beauty products, electronics, entertainment, pharmaceuticals, home and garden accessories, and automobile parts or accessories, among others. What Gen Z Want From Brands:We are talking about a generation that cares a lot about social issues and so the Favorite Brands of Gen Z are expected to be drivers of social change, with fair labor practices, inclusivity, and sustainability. Diversity also came out as a big driver of societal impact for this generation. Gen Z is remarkably more diverse than the generations before it. They’ve already achieved a 50% multicultural total threshold, with approximately half of the entire Gen Zers in the U.S. identifying as non-white. They are also far more likely to identify as LGBTQ+. Gen Z will reward brands for celebrating individuality with diverse representation, and challenging stereotypes. What’s different from older generations, though, is the unifying power of their differences. If you want to check out which businesses are prioritizing and celebrating diversity in America, please refer to 15 Most Diverse Companies in the U.S.Gen Z are also a more health-conscious generation and a growing share of them is even turning away from alcohol. In 2022, 38% of Gen Z were buying more non-alcoholic beverages than in the previous year. This has led to the rise of companies like the Athletic Brewing Co. The non-alcoholic beer maker has now become one of the Largest Craft Breweries in the US by Volume. Authenticity is also highly valued by this generation and Gen Z hates brands that are all talk and no action, and that say things they simply don’t mean. How to Market to Gen Z in 2023:Following are the tips that businesses can employ to build their own effective Gen Z marketing strategy:Prioritize Social Media: Gen Z spend a significant amount of time on social media and in fact, 8 out of our 25 Favorite Gen Z Brands are social media platforms. So businesses must have a solid social media presence. Embrace Diversity, Authenticity and Inclusivity: Businesses should avoid gimmicks like greenwashing etc. and try to be more transparent. They also need to represent diverse identities in their marketing campaigns and give a message of inclusivity. Prioritize Mobile Optimization: An estimated 98% of Gen Z own mobile phones, so there should be a sharp focus on efficient and easy-to-use mobile apps. A good example of this is the Nike App by NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Leverage Influencers: Gen Z rely on social media influencers even for their shopping decisions and habits, so having some influential names on your side could be a game changer. Gen Z Product Trends for 2023:Sustainability is at heart of the Gen Z values and they have once again popularized the thrift culture, due to become a $51 billion business by 2025. But at the same time, they also can’t seem to get away from fast fashion. Other than the wide array of choices fast fashion brands like Zara and Shein have to offer, they are also very cost effective, and after all, this generation has grown up in a time of increased global economic uncertainty. Another trend that Gen Z are bringing back is brick and mortar stores, with almost half of them prioritizing shopping in-store rather than online. These Zoomers see shopping at physical stores as a form of ‘retail therapy’, which allows them to disconnect from the stress of social media and browse shelves and clothing racks in the real world. Brands can take the example of  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is continuing to open brick and mortar stores.Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) gives customers more flexibility by breaking up payments over weeks or months, and is also a trend that is now hugely popular with Gen Zers. In an uncertain economic climate, BNPL allows these young customers the flexibility to purchase their daily essentials, instead of going without. A leading example of this is Klarna, a hugely popular Swedish financial services company providing BNPL facilities to its users. Klarna’s obvious appeal for its Gen Z shoppers helped it snag a $45.6 billion valuation in a funding round led by SoftBank in 2021. Social shopping is another trend that is rapidly catching on in the U.S. Gen Z don’t view social media merely as a source of entertainment, but also depend on their trusted influencers to try out their desired products and give them feedback, upon which they will make their purchasing decisions. A product ad with a famous celebrity pictured on it just isn’t enough for them anymore. In 2021, the U.S. saw approximately 96.9 million social buyers and its popularity is only expected to grow. Social commerce sales in the U.S. were estimated at nearly $51.8 billion in 2022, and are predicted to reach $145.2 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 15.86% in the forecast period. With that said, here is a List of Favorite Brands of Gen Z in 2023.   Gen Z's 25 Favorite Brands in 2023magicinfoto / Shutterstock.comMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to several sources, including various subreddits and topics on Reddit, and then websites like YPulse, New York Post, Morning Consult etc., looking for the Favorite Brands of Zoomers in 2023. Then we assigned a score to these brands based on the number of times they appeared in the aforementioned sources and ranked them accordingly (in ascending order of high scores). When two brands had the same score, we ranked them according to their revenue for the year 2022. Gen Z's 25 Favorite Brands in 202325. DiscordInsider Monkey Score: 4Often dubbed ‘Slack for Gen Z’, Discord has evolved into the newest tool for brands to build and communicate to their communities and audiences. 65% of Gen Z feel more confident online with community-focused social apps, so Discord letting users create and monitor their own communities really helps. The gamification aspect of Discord additionally facilitates the entertainment interests and behaviors of Gen Zers. 24. Depop Insider Monkey Score: 4The next wave of luxury consumers, Gen Z are a fluid generation who crave flexibility and think second hand clothes are cool. Resale apps like Depop are globalizing Gen Z fashion culture through an international, digital shopping experience tailored to identity creation. Depop’s accessibility and endless range of products allow people to buy and sell fashion all over the world like never before. Depop was acquired for $1.62 billion by the e-commerce company Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) in 2021. 23. Apple PayInsider Monkey Score: 4Gen Z in the U.S. seem to have developed a liking towards the iPhone and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products in general. A new report by Financial Times indicates that 70% of people aged 18-24 in the U.S. already have an iPhone. Gen Z have a strong affinity for using digital wallets and with Apple ID, Apple Pay is available to users across multiple devices, making payment easier across multiple channels. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has therefore succeeded to tap into the Gen Z demand for products that are easy to use and communicate seamlessly – ensuring that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are embedded into the everyday life of youngsters today. 22. TwitchInsider Monkey Score: 4Twitch is among Gen Z’s Favorite Brands in 2023 and the company burst onto the scene in 2005 as a real-time platform, where users could broadcast their daily lives. Although there are several other categories available on the platform, gaming remains the core of Twitch. With over 240 million monthly active users, Twitch is the market leader in the live streaming industry, with a 73% market share. The platform is a gold mine for Gen Z and Twitch’s internal data indicates that Twitch has the highest proportion of Gen Z users to total audience size – 55%. What’s even more interesting is the positive sentiment in the Twitch community for the monetization of channels and running ads, thus creating a massive opportunity for potential advertisers. 21. GatoradeInsider Monkey Score: 4According to YPulse’s Cooking and Diet Report, a quarter of Gen Z and Millennials are reaching for energy drinks on a typical day, but they’re also super conscious about what they put in their bodies. Gatorade launched their Fast Twitch drinks in February to reach young consumers who may shy away from energy drinks out of fear of their negative health effects. Fast Twitch includes 200 mgs of caffeine, zero sugar and select vitamins, and is designed as a healthy option for athletes.  Gen Z is tech-savvy, so Gatorade has responded to that with their Gx System product portfolio, including the Gx sweat patch, a mobile app and a ‘smart bottle’. 20. RedditInsider Monkey Score: 5Reddit is all about fostering community by encouraging its users to interact with each other. The platform is a hybrid between a forum and a modern social network – Subreddits are like individual forum sites, but you can participate in everything with one account, like a social network. The other big thing that sets Reddit apart is that instead of using complicated algorithmic tools to rank content, its algorithm runs on votes, simple and effective. Reddit continues to grow by double digits every year, adding 25% more users in 2020 and 14% in 2021. That growth, combined with 40% of Gen Z searching social media platforms for info instead of Google, makes Reddit a unique opportunity for brands. 19. Fenty BeautyInsider Monkey Score: 5Back in 2017, Fenty Beauty, by Rihanna, was created with the promise of inclusion for all women and launched with 40 foundation shades, consistent with their focus on inclusive beauty. They’ve since become the standard in cosmetic equality and representation. A quick look at Fenty’s Instagram feed shows a wide array of skin colors and culturally-diverse models. With its earth-conscious packaging, supple textures and irresistible scents, Fenty Beauty is not only among the Top Brands for Gen Z but also a favorite brand of millennials everywhere. 18. Twitter Insider Monkey Score: 5Twitter is one of the Brands Preferred by Gen Z in 2023 and the platform reaches 70% of 18-25 year olds. Twitter, more than anything, is about what’s happening, and that is one of the main reasons why they come to the platform. For them, Twitter is like a global newspaper that gives them a window to the world. It also gives them a space to be vocal, explore out loud, grow in public, stir things up, and of course, have a bit of a joke. 17. Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN)Insider Monkey Score: 5Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through its unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. As counterintuitive as it may sound, Gen Z is still very much active with in-store shopping and Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) is giving them what they want with their brick and mortar in-store experience. Moreover, the company understands that Gen Z want to stand out from conventional fashion trends, so it has catered to their needs with a long line of edgy and unique products.16. Playstation Insider Monkey Score: 5Research indicates that 95% of millennials and Gen Z play video games, with 80% doing so on video game consoles, and roughly half of these console game players prefer to play on a Playstation. Gen Z is much more accustomed to a ‘connected’ life and often look for community and a sense of belonging in their hyper-digital lives. Gaming consoles like Playstation give them an opportunity for relaxation and self-expression, and provide them with a huge international online community of fellow gamers that they can interact and bond with. 15. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Insider Monkey Score: 5With a user share of 83%, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the most popular online payment service in the U.S. Approximately 21% of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) users are between the ages of 18 and 29 and the popular digital wallet is the favorite brand of Gen Z for online payment solutions. With multiple preferred payment options, optimized processing, a mobile-friendly flow, BNPL, Venmo, and so much more, Gen Z customers may be attracted to the PayPal checkout experience. 14. DoritosInsider Monkey Score: 6Doritos has a clearly defined brand personality that resonates with the Gen Z audience. It is the ultimate party chip and no social event is complete without Doritos chips and salsa. Gen Z doesn’t like branding, so Doritos tried a new approach through their ‘anti-ad’, with the company dropping its logo and brand name from its advertising, social feed and packs to attract the younger, ad-adverse audience. 13. Snapchat Insider Monkey Score: 6Snapchat is used by approximately 58% of Gen Z and the brand delivers on the emotions that they seek, and it does so consistently across the platform in areas like Discover, Stories, and the Camera. Snapchat also launched its $3.99 monthly Snapchat + subscription last year, which enables members to use new features including the ability to boost stories, the ability to see who has rewatched their stories, and many more. When these young consumers are using Snapchat to conduct much of their social lives online, features like these can give subscribers the kind of advantage they crave. 12. H&amp;MInsider Monkey Score: 6H&amp;M is one of the favorite brands of Gen Z in 2023. The fast-fashion company, known for its focus on swiftly knocking off trends from the runway and selling them off at basement prices for maximum turnover, has started focusing more on circular fashion models, such as resale in the past few years. The retailer teamed up with Reflaunt to launch its own second-hand fashion platform in Canada, called H&amp;M Rewear. The brand has also launched a range of cruelty-free and vegan beauty basics for Gen Zers recently. 11. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Insider Monkey Score: 7Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is one of the Favorite Brands of Gen Zers in 2023 and they often turn to the retailer for personal care, household goods, clothing, accessories, and beauty private label items. The defining factor between the retailer and its Gen Z customer base is trust, an attribute that is hard to capture with the least brand loyal demographic. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has taken a number of steps to attract its Gen Z consumers, but there are a few attributes that really set it apart – its omni-channel approach, affordable pricing, product selection, and CSR initiatives. The Minnesota-based retailer comes in at number 7 for the top 100 retailers by sales in the U.S. in 2022, with $104.62 billion in revenue. If you want to read about the largest retailers worldwide, please refer to our article 20 Largest Retailers in the World.

From Tesla to SpaceX, and from Neuralink to The Boring Company — and most recently, Twitter — Musk is no stranger to controversy and is known for speaking his mind.See Our List: 100 Most Influential Money ExpertsFind: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchNot everything Elon Musk has done, financially speaking, has been exemplary. However, Musk’s best money moves are at the center of many commentaries, however, and four follow.PayPal: An Early Mind for Bold InvestingMusk founded X.com, later named PayPal, and sold it to eBay for $1.4 billion in 2002, according to The Wall Street Journal. He collected $100 million from the deal.“One of Elon’s best financial moves was placing most of his net worth into Paypal, at a time where the ‘.com’ world was seriously taking off,” said Sebastian Jania, owner of Ontario Property Buyers.Upon successful growth of this company, he sold it and was paid handsomely — but instead of cashing out of the “entrepreneurship game” and living on the proceeds, he recycled his money into three more businesses which also took off as successes, said Jania.“This was a very wise decision as he was able to take his successes in the tech industry and diversify across solar, automotive, and space industries. This move protected him in case the tech industry or other industries would crash.”Musk Reinvests Profits Into his VisionsElon Musk has made billions of dollars from his ventures but doesn’t all profits on lavish lifestyles or frivolous things, said Anna Koval, co-founder and CMO at Tarotoo.“Instead, he reinvests his profits into his vision of making humanity a multi-planetary species and advancing clean energy and transportation. This shows his passion, dedication, and long-term thinking, which are essential for any successful entrepreneur.”Story continuesKoval added that while he takes calculated risks and learns from failures, Musk is not afraid to take bold and ambitious positions — such as launching rockets into space, building electric cars and creating hyperloops.“He knows that these risks come with challenges and failures, but he also knows that they are necessary for innovation and growth. He learns from his failures and improves his products and services, rather than giving up or settling for mediocrity,” she added.Money Expert Jaspreet Singh: Get Rich Through These 3 InvestmentsMusk Is Not Afraid of Out of the Box IdeasMusk begins by asking the most basic of questions — usually to find cost savings or a better user experience, said Brian Chevalier-Jordan, CMO at NationalBusinessCapital.com. And by not taking anything for granted, he uncovers new insights that help him run his businesses better than his competitors, Chevalier-Jordan added.“The lesson for the rest of us is: question what we’ve always thought was true about ourselves, our habits, and our behavior around money,” Chevalier-Jordan suggested. “For better or worse, Elon isn’t afraid to go somewhere where he has very little or no experience. That can lead to unexpected insights such as the idea that a tunnel under cities could help alleviate traffic if it’s used for public transportation. He used that concept to found not one, but two, companies: The Boring Company and Hyperloop.”Musk Understands That Branding Is KingAccording to Chevalier-Jordan, while Musk may come across to some as immature, that might be a feature, not a bug.“You certainly can’t say he isn’t having fun while becoming the world’s richest man. From the Tesla feature called Emissions Mode that makes fart noises — to the recent cage fight challenge which he proposed to Mark Zuckerberg — he puts his eccentricity on display. That has won him the loyalty of others who share his sense of humor. This trait has bought him a permanent place in many people’s minds,” he said.Chevalier-Jordan added that while Musk is “clearly a king of bombast,” that doesn’t mean he’s not savvy with his communications.“His marketing acumen is on point with names like The Boring Company for his tunnel-digging company, or the model names of Tesla’s cars that, when put together, spell S3XY (‘sexy’).”“When he turned Occupy Wall Street into a rallying cry for his rocket company, Space X, using the phrase ‘Occupy Mars,’ he showed branding is king,” Chevalier-Jordan concluded.More From GOBankingRates10 Brilliant Ways To Reduce Your Taxes in RetirementUnplug These Appliances That Hike Up Your Electricity Bill3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,0009 Effective Tips and Tricks To Help You Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Best Money Lessons From Elon Musk]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, Block Inc. SQ, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN and MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Focus on These 5 Crypto Stocks for Long-Term GainsThe cryptocurrency market regained its lost glory this year. The last year was a disappointing one as the Fed pursued aggressive monetary control with a massive hike in the benchmark lending rate to combat 40-year high inflation.A high interest rate is detrimental to growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies. Tighter monetary control also raised concern that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future. Moreover, a series of unfortunate events — mainly the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud leading to the bankruptcy of FTX — also dented market participants' confidence in digital currency like crypto.The situation reversed this year buoyed by a favorable macro-economic scenario. The Fed reduced the magnitude of interest rate hikes as inflation dropped steadily. Importantly, in spite of facing tighter monetary control in the past one and a half years, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid. This evaporated the concern of a near-term recession.Finally, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors. BlackRock Inc.'s (BLK) decision to launch a Bitcoin ETF and the decision of The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)-led consortium to create a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, have attracted several investors toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin to name a few.Headwinds PersistDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the economy is not completely out of the woods. The Fed paused rate hikes in its June FOMC meeting after 10 consecutive increases. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that more rate hikes are likely this year as inflation remains elevated, much higher than the central bank's 2% target.Story continuesThe minutes of the June FOMC meeting showed that Fed members unanimously opined for more rate hike going forward as the inflation rate remains elevated. The June FOMC dot-plot showed that most members were expecting two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each by the end of this year.For example, in the initial hours of trading on Jul 6, the price of Bitcoin touched a 13-month high of $31,450, primarily due to soaring demand from institutional investors. However, extremely strong private sector payroll data for June released by Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) changed the whole scenario.Market participants unanimously infer that a tight labor market — currently the sole concern of the Fed — will compel the central bank to hike rate again. The CME FedWatch is currently showing a 92.5% probability of a 25-basis point interest rate hike in the July FOMC meeting. Consequently, Bitcoin lost its momentum and fell more than 1% from its peak.Long-Term Gains in ViewAt this stage, investors should think from a long-term perspective. Despite more rate hike warnings, the Fed is undoubtedly approaching the end of the higher rate regime. We may not see any rate hike in 2024 and may witness a rate cut at the end of next year if macro-economic data remains favorable.Therefore, investors should accumulate cryptocurrencies using a buy-on-the-dip strategy. Every dip in crypto prices will be a good purchasing point in order to gain handsomely once the Fed's tighter monetary control comes to an end.Our Stock SelectionWe have narrowed our search to five stocks with solid crypto exposure and strong growth potential.PayPal Holdings Inc. operates digital wallets and allows users to buy, transfer and sell cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the data storage industry, head directly to 5 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now. Fortune Business Insights predicts that the worldwide data storage market will experience substantial growth, increasing from $247.32 billion in 2023 to $777.98 billion by 2030. This growth is expected to occur at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8% throughout the forecast period. The growing adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud-based services, and data analytics is fueling the growth of the data storage market. This year, industry experts forecast a spike in the adoption of object storage. To maintain a competitive edge, businesses are likely to reassess storage tiering and cloud solutions, aiming to trim their environmental footprint by adopting more compact and energy-efficient options. Additionally, automation is expected to grow as organizations strive to attain their sustainability and efficiency objectives. According to Brent Ellis, a senior analyst at Forrester Research: “Object storage pairs very well with cloud-native application development, because you don’t actually need a storage driver to address it. You can just address an S3 bucket directly, which means you can span multiple locations in very interesting ways.”Don't Miss: 25 Biggest Cloud Providers by RevenueObject storage stores and manages data as discrete, self-contained units, and unlike traditional file or block storage, object storage provides unlimited scalability. Rick Vanover, a senior director at backup vendor Veeam, explained the benefits of object storage: “Companies have a lot of data they really care about, and object storage has a lot of features that really help protect it, like immutability and archive storage classes. It provides a great combination of security capabilities and tiering and managing the lifecycle so organizations can have great cost/performance and security.”Story continuesThe cloud storage market is undergoing big moves. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s plan to split its cloud unit into a standalone entity has raised concerns about its long-term prospects due to higher regulatory scrutiny and extensive competition. Analysts suggest that external investment and separation from Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s primary e-commerce business could support international expansion, particularly to compete with industry giants like Amazon Web Services. However, others speculate that the Chinese government may invest in the cloud unit or it could become a private entity, given its leadership in the domestic cloud computing industry. Such changes could also improve AliCloud's market share in China, where growth is primarily driven by government and state-owned enterprises that have been slower to make the shift to cloud services. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s cloud computing division announced in May 2023 that it will invest $13 billion in India by the end of this decade, as it is one of Asia's quickest growing economies. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s decision aligns with India’s plans to attract larger investments in the digital sector to meet the growing demand for data storage and services from corporations and government entities. To benefit from the advancements and growth potential in the data storage industry, investors can pick up stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also provides cloud-based storage through iCloud, we did not include the stock on our list since it is primarily compatible with Apple devices only. Our MethodologyWe selected the following data storage stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Data Storage Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: ralwel / 123RF Stock PhotoBest Data Storage Stocks to Buy Now10. Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) is a California-based provider of data storage technologies, products, and services. On May 31, Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) reported GAAP earnings per share of -$0.22, beating market consensus by $0.02. The revenue of $589.31 million also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $30 million. The company announced a year-over-year increase of approximately 30% in revenue from subscription services as well as in the annual recurring revenue (ARR) generated by subscriptions.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG), compared to 39 funds in the last quarter. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.26 million shares worth $185.2 million. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. 9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology corporation that provides on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions. It is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. On June 26,International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reached an agreement to purchase Apptio, an enterprise software company, from Vista Equity Partners for $4.6 billion. The deal is anticipated to be finalized in the second half of 2023. By combining Apptio's offerings with IBM's IT automation software and Watson AI platform, clients will have access to a comprehensive solution for optimizing all their technology interests.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 49 hedge funds were bullish on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), compared to 43 funds in the earlier quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 680,290 shares worth $89 million. Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), a data analytics and systems monitoring company, is one of the best storage stocks to invest in. With Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)’s storage solutions, users can securely store and manage large volumes of data generated by their applications, systems, and infrastructure. On May 4, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 and a revenue of $482 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $12.99 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 64 hedge funds held stakes worth approximately $1.9 billion in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.4 billion. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $192 million. RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an enterprise information technology company that provides storage solutions, networking, enterprise servers, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software, and related customer services. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. On June 12, the company declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on July 26, to shareholders of record on July 12. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 67 hedge funds were bullish on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared to 65 funds in the prior quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 20.6 million shares worth $1.9 billion. Ariel Focus Fund made the following comment about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Additionally, global leader in enterprise software, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) traded higher in the quarter, driven by solid quarterly earnings, a material increase in the dividend as well as forward looking guidance that implies a substantial acceleration in organic cloud growth for full year 2023. We believe these results highlight ORCL’s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company’s cloud platform as a competitive offering.”6. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures, and commercializes memory and storage products worldwide. The company’s operations are divided into four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the premier data storage stocks to watch. Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party's over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today15 Best Coding Games to Learn Programming for Beginners25 Best Work from Home Jobs for 2023 Disclosure: None. 10 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Here's how you can carve out your own piece of the student housing market with just $500.While Bud Light is grappling with declining sales, competitors are seizing the opportunity to swoop in and grab market share. Here's a look at two beverage stocks that Wall Street finds particularly attractive.Constellation Brands Inc. (NYSE:STZ)According to NielsonIQ data, Bud Light is no longer America's best-selling beer. The top spot now belongs to Modelo Especial, brewed by Constellation Brands.Constellation Brands is a leading international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits. Other than Modelo Especial, the company has many other popular brands, such as Corona beer, Robert Mondavi wines and High West whiskey.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Constellation Brands generated $2.51 billion of net sales, representing a 6% increase from a year ago.In April, the company announced an 11% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 89 cents per share. At the current share price, Constellation Brands offers an annual yield of 1.4%.The stock is up around 11% year to date, and Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian sees further upside on the horizon. The analyst has an Overweight rating on Constellation Brands and a price target of $290 — roughly 14% above where the stock currently sits.Molson Coors Beverage Co. (NYSE:TAP)Another company that could benefit from the Bud Light fiasco is Molson Coors.Molson Coors was formed by the merger of Molson Inc. of Canada and Adolph Coors Co. of the U.S. in 2005. Today, it has a portfolio of iconic beer brands, including Coors Light, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian, Blue Moon and many others.If consumers move away from Bud Light, they might opt for Coors Light or Miller Lite instead.Molson Coors has already enjoyed increasing investor attention, with its shares surging 34% year to date. The company pays quarterly dividends of 41 cents per share, translating to an annual yield of 2.5%.Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy has a Buy rating on Molson Coors and a price target of $75. Since shares trade at around $66.30, the price target implies a potential upside of 13%.Beer companies have the potential to be solid dividends investments because of the resilience of beer sales across economic cycles. As with all stocks, brewers can see their share prices fluctuate unpredictably — and even top analysts aren't right 100% of the time.If you don't like such volatility, you might want to look into reliable income plays outside the stock market — such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Read next:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Blackstone Bet $13 Billion On The Impending Student Housing Price Surge.

That put its starting price below the Qin EV from BYD, one of China's most popular models.VW is China's top-selling foreign automaker.Since January, when Tesla cut prices in China, about two dozen automakers have followed with price cuts of their own to stay competitive and stoke demand.China's auto market, the world's largest, is on track for overall growth of about 3%, with the share of EVs and plug-ins rising fast. Consultancy AlixPartners forecasts this will be the first year made-in-China brands top 50% of their home market.Those changes have created intensifying competition over price and features that have both driven EV sales and threatened industry-wide profitability, analysts say.China's auto association on Saturday withdrew a pledge it had brokered among 16 automakers, including Tesla, to avoid ""abnormal pricing,"" saying it recognized that would violate antitrust law.Story continuesGM CFO Paul Jacobson said last month the Lyriq represented an opportunity for the automaker in China. Cadillac sales were down almost 8% in China last year, industry data shows.The Lyriq, which starts from just under $59,000 in the United States, has had a slow rollout since its introduction last year. GM officials said U.S. pricing remains unchanged.GM sold 2,326 Lyriqs in the United States in the first half of the year. It sold 918 in China in the first quarter, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, which is set to announce first-half sales data later this month.GM said on Monday it delivered more than 526,000 vehicles in China in the second quarter, up 9%. Of that total, over 115,000 were EVs.($1 = 7.2370 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Zhang Yan and Brenda Goh; Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Sharon Singleton)]"

PNC enjoys solid loan and deposit balances, which are expected to keep supporting financials. Also, its inorganic expansion strategies have helped diversify its business mix. However, elevated expenses and declining net-interest income (NII) are major headwinds.PNC Financial stands solid from the balance-sheet perspective as its total loans and deposits have been rising over the years. We estimate total deposits to increase by 2.5% sequentially in third-quarter 2023. With decent pipelines, PNC is well poised for loan balance growth in 2023. It expects loans to rise in the 1-3% band in 2023.The company remains committed to strengthening its business through strategic initiatives. In September 2022, it closed the buyout of Linga, a POS and payment solutions firm, in a bid to expand corporate payments capabilities in the hospitality and restaurant industry space.The acquisition of BBVA USA customers and employees to PNC Financial's network and platforms, which was completed in June 2021, boosted its foothold as a commercial bank in all top 30 markets of the United States. Thus, the bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments and diversify its business mix.PNC Financial’s capital deployment activities enhance shareholders’ value. In July 2023, it sequentially hiked quarterly cash dividend on the common stock by 3.3% to $1.55 per share. Regular dividend payments along with a share repurchase plan in place is likely to stoke investors’ confidence in the stock in the upcoming period.PNC’s available cash balance at first-quarter 2023 end was $5.9 billion while its times interest earned ratio was 5.2. Hence with ample liquidity, its capital-deployment activities seem sustainable.On the flip side, despite the company’s NII rising over the years, higher funding costs are expected to affect NII going forward. In fact, management expects the metric to decline 2-4% sequentially in second-quarter 2023. Such decline in NII might impede its top-line growth.Story continuesAlso, PNC’s escalating non-interest expenses due to rising branch-related occupancy expenses and increased technology investments are concerning. Accelerated investment spend on technology is likely to continue affecting the bottom line in the near term. We estimate the metric to reach $13.5 billion in the current year.The majority of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio, nearly 69% as of Mar 31, 2023, comprises of commercial loans. Given the current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates may put some strain on commercial lending. Moreover, in case of any economic downturn, the asset quality of the loan category might deteriorate. Therefore, such a lack of diversification in the loan portfolio can be risky for the company amid an uncertain economy and competitive markets.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have plunged 21.9% against growth of 0.2% recorded by the industry over the past year. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Finance Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Velocity Financial, Inc.

PPG as the Bull of the Day and The Andersons, Inc. ANDE as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC and M&amp;T Bank Corp. MTB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:PPG Industries, Inc. is bullish about the growth in paints and coatings in 2023 as the auto industry and aerospace outperformed in Q1. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by 20.2% this year.PPG was founded in Pennsylvania in 1883. The company is celebrating its 140th year in business this year. It develops and delivers paints, coatings and specialty materials to customers in more than 70 countries. It has customers in the construction, consumer products, industrial and transportation markets and aftermarkets.PPG Outlines Growth FrameworkOn May 24, 2023, PPG shared its PPG framework for purposeful, profitable growth for the next 4 years.It aims to establish annual 2% to 4% organic sales growth. It expects annual adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12% through 2026.Additionally, it aims for free cash flow of about $1 billion per year.Record Q1 SalesOn Apr 20, 2023, PPG reported its first quarter results and blew by the Zacks Consensus, reporting earnings of $1.82 versus the consensus of $1.55. That's a beat of $0.27, or 17.4%.It was the second beat in a row for PPG.The company saw record first quarter sales of $4.38 billion, up 2% from $4.308 billion in the prior year due to an 8% rise in selling prices while volumes declined 3%.Several businesses outperformed the company's original forecast including the aerospace coatings business and the Latin America region, with both delivering record sales. PPG's automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) coatings business also was boosted by solid global production growth.Story continuesAnalysts Getting Bullish AgainPPG will report second quarter results on July 20, 2023. In April, the company believed the macro environment would generally remain consistent with the first quarter with continued stabilization of economic activity at lower levels in Europe and modestly improving demand in China.In the US, PPG expected sequential slowing in economic activity in certain end-use markets, particularly in those that were construction-related.It gave full year earnings guidance in the range of $6.95 to $7.25.But analysts don't seem to think the April forecast is going to be correct. 1 analyst has raised both the 2023 and 2024 earnings estimate in the last week and that has pushed the consensus above the company's guidance range.The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $7.27 from $6.84 just 3 months ago. That's earnings growth of 20.2% over 2022 where the company made $6.05.Shares Attractively ValuedShares of PPG are up 16.7% year-to-date which is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is up 14.6%.But it is still attractively valued with a forward P/E of 20 and a PEG ratio of just 1.1. It also has a price-to-sales ratio of just 1.9.PPG is also shareholder friendly and pays a dividend, yielding 1.7%.For investors looking for a play on the industrial and chemical side of the economy, PPG Industries should be one on your short list.Bear of the Day:The Andersons, Inc. is navigating a changing agriculture market in 2023. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings decline nearly 35% this year.The Andersons is an agribusiness company which has grown, over the last 76 years, from a single grain elevator to a diverse company with commodity merchandising (trade), renewables, and nutrient and industrial specialties.It has 79 facilities in the trade division, 4 in renewables and 37 in nutrient and industrial.Q1 Record for TradeOn May 2, 2023, The Andersons reported its first quarter 2023 results and beat the Zacks Consensus by $0.03. Earnings were $0.20 versus the consensus of $0.17. It was the fourth earnings beat in a row. It's last earnings miss came at the start of the Ukraine War when it got caught on the wrong side of the trade as prices spiked.Trade led the first quarter this year, with an adjusted pretax income of $24 million, a record first quarter. Renewables saw a pretax loss of $83 million  while Nutrient &amp; Industrial also reported a pretax loss of $10 million on a slow start to the planting season.Fertilizer prices fell in the quarter and customers deferred purchasing. The Andersons said some of the typical first quarter business would shift into Q2, but The Andersons didn't believe all of it would be recovered.The company continues to generate strong free cash flows. The Andersons is shareholder friendly and currently pays a dividend yielding 1.6%.Analysts Are BearishThe 2023 Zacks Consensus has been on the decline over the last 60 days as one analyst had cut estimates during that time. The Zacks Consensus has fallen to $2.65 from $2.94 over the last 2 months.That is an earnings decline of 34.6% over 2022 which saw The Andersons make $4.05.However, keep in mind that The Andersons is a small cap company with a market cap of just $1.6 billion. Small cap companies are lightly covered on Wall Street compared to the large caps. Zacks only has 2 full year estimates for 2023.Shares Up in 2023Despite the earnings decline, shares are up 33.4% year-to-date and are trading near 52-week highs.It's not cheap on a P/E basis as it has a forward P/E of 17.6 but it has dirt-cheap P/B and P/S ratios of 1.2 and 0.09, respectively.Still, the rebound off the 2022 sell-off appears to be priced in now but the shares have yet to take out the 2022 highs. The Andersons will report second quarter results on Aug 1, 2023. Investors interested in an agribusiness company should tune into the earnings results. They could be a catalyst for some positive earnings estimate revisions, and a change in the Zacks Rank.Additional content:What to Expect from Wells Fargo's (WFC) Q2 Earnings Report?Wells Fargo &amp; Company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 14, before the opening bell. The company's quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to have improved year over year.In the last reported quarter, WFC's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher net interest income (NII) and solid average loan growth. The fall in non-interest expenses acted as another tailwind. However, dismal non-interest income, higher provisions and weakness in the mortgage business were the major undermining factors.Over the trailing four quarters, Wells Fargo's earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 7.17%.Let's take a look at factors that are expected to have influenced Wells Fargo's second-quarter earnings.Loans and NII: Banks' lending activities are likely to have declined in the second quarter, as the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates impacted consumer spending. Per Fed's latest data, demand for commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans and consumer loans decreased in April and May from first-quarter end.Nonetheless, in May 2023, Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 5-5.25%, the highest since 2008. Further, in June it declared no changes in the given policy rate. Driven by interest rate hikes, Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed an improvement in earning asset yields, margin and NII in the quarter to be reported. Also, lower mortgage-backed securities premium amortization is expected to have aided NII.Amid these considerations, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC's NII is pegged at $12.94 billion, indicating a 26.9% rise from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.Mortgage Banking Revenues: In first-quarter 2023, Wells Fargo communicated its strategic plans to exit Correspondent business with an intention to reduce risks in mortgage business. Further, in the second quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.81% in June, up from 4.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing compared with the prior-year quarter.Hence, being one of the largest bank mortgage lenders in the United States, WFC is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking income in second-quarter 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC's second-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $250 million, implying a 12.9% fall on a year-over-year basis.Overall Non-Interest Revenues: Wells Fargo's investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have borne the brunt of weaker equity and fixed-income market performance. A dip in market valuations and lower transactional activities are expected to have been headwinds too.Further, the company is likely to have seen lower deposit-related fees due to an expected decline in deposits given the impact of regional bank collapses. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $1.15 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 16.2%.Global deal making is likely to have continued shrinking in the second quarter from the prior year, with deal volume and total deal value numbers crashing. Geopolitical tensions, inflation, high interest rates and fears of a global recession are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals.Similarly, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances are expected to have dried up in the to-be-reported quarter. Bond issuance volume might have witnessed a decline too as investors turned pessimistic.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo's total non-interest income is pegged at $7.23 billion, suggesting a 5.9% increase from the prior-year quarter's reported number.Expenses: Wells Fargo's costs are expected to have continued flaring up in the second quarter, given its franchise investments in technology and digitalization efforts. Additionally, amid the rising inflation, salary expenses are anticipated to have led to elevated non-interest expenses. This is likely to have hindered bottom-line growth during the quarter under review.Asset Quality: With expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook and growing recession risk, Wells Fargo's credit quality is likely to have deteriorated. Moreover, given the heighted market volatility, commercial loan defaults are expected to have risen. Hence, as WFC has a substantial exposure to commercial loans, it is likely to increase reserves in the second quarter.What Our Model PredictsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of WFC beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low.

153,8c543e19-4bac-313d-8107-7b293dc9afd7,TGT,2023-07-11,Gen Z’s 25 Favorite Brands in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-25-favorite-brands-092948829.html,1689067788,STORY,"['AAPL', 'PYPL', 'URBN', 'TGT']","[In this article, we are going to discuss Gen Z’s 25 favorite brands in 2023. You can skip our detailed analysis of why Gen Z are a digital native generation, the purchasing power of Gen Z, products Gen Z use the most, what Gen Z want from brands, how to market to Gen Z in 2023, and Gen Z product trends for 2023, and go directly to Gen Z’s 10 Favorite Brands in 2023.  Social scientists have studied generations, in theory and more practically, for millennia. More recently, philosophers like Auguste Comte have argued that generational change is the engine behind social change. More specifically, each generation entering into a new life stage at more or less the same time is the pulse that creates the history of our society. Specific major-scale events can also change the outlook of a generation, and are often reflected in how they’re named. The Greatest Generation is known for the heroic sacrifices they made during World War ll. The Baby Boomers, in turn, had their outlook colored by the Vietnam War and the social upheavals of the ‘60s. More recently, Millennials’ worldviews have been shaped by the events of 9/11 and the proliferation of the internet. Digital Natives:Similarly, Gen Z have been born in an age when the internet has achieved widespread use and is a part of our everyday lives, making them the real ‘digital natives’. The ‘Zoomers’ are a super-informed generation who turn to the internet for any kind of information and for work, shopping, dating, entertainment, and making friends online. They have grown up in a time of rapid globalization, when various media and technologies have significantly accelerated social interaction and cultural exchange around the world. Purchasing Power of Gen Z:Born between 1996 and 2010, Generation Z are not kids anymore. In fact, they’re the new generation of consumers that big brands, small and medium businesses, and marketers need to think about. With an estimated collective buying power of $463 billion in the U.S. alone, and $853 billion globally, business owners and marketers are starting to pay attention. Story continuesProducts Gen Z Use the Most:According to Klarna, the products that Gen Z shoppers spend on the most are clothing and shoes, groceries, beauty products, electronics, entertainment, pharmaceuticals, home and garden accessories, and automobile parts or accessories, among others. What Gen Z Want From Brands:We are talking about a generation that cares a lot about social issues and so the Favorite Brands of Gen Z are expected to be drivers of social change, with fair labor practices, inclusivity, and sustainability. Diversity also came out as a big driver of societal impact for this generation. Gen Z is remarkably more diverse than the generations before it. They’ve already achieved a 50% multicultural total threshold, with approximately half of the entire Gen Zers in the U.S. identifying as non-white. They are also far more likely to identify as LGBTQ+. Gen Z will reward brands for celebrating individuality with diverse representation, and challenging stereotypes. What’s different from older generations, though, is the unifying power of their differences. If you want to check out which businesses are prioritizing and celebrating diversity in America, please refer to 15 Most Diverse Companies in the U.S.Gen Z are also a more health-conscious generation and a growing share of them is even turning away from alcohol. In 2022, 38% of Gen Z were buying more non-alcoholic beverages than in the previous year. This has led to the rise of companies like the Athletic Brewing Co. The non-alcoholic beer maker has now become one of the Largest Craft Breweries in the US by Volume. Authenticity is also highly valued by this generation and Gen Z hates brands that are all talk and no action, and that say things they simply don’t mean. How to Market to Gen Z in 2023:Following are the tips that businesses can employ to build their own effective Gen Z marketing strategy:Prioritize Social Media: Gen Z spend a significant amount of time on social media and in fact, 8 out of our 25 Favorite Gen Z Brands are social media platforms. So businesses must have a solid social media presence. Embrace Diversity, Authenticity and Inclusivity: Businesses should avoid gimmicks like greenwashing etc. and try to be more transparent. They also need to represent diverse identities in their marketing campaigns and give a message of inclusivity. Prioritize Mobile Optimization: An estimated 98% of Gen Z own mobile phones, so there should be a sharp focus on efficient and easy-to-use mobile apps. A good example of this is the Nike App by NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Leverage Influencers: Gen Z rely on social media influencers even for their shopping decisions and habits, so having some influential names on your side could be a game changer. Gen Z Product Trends for 2023:Sustainability is at heart of the Gen Z values and they have once again popularized the thrift culture, due to become a $51 billion business by 2025. But at the same time, they also can’t seem to get away from fast fashion. Other than the wide array of choices fast fashion brands like Zara and Shein have to offer, they are also very cost effective, and after all, this generation has grown up in a time of increased global economic uncertainty. Another trend that Gen Z are bringing back is brick and mortar stores, with almost half of them prioritizing shopping in-store rather than online. These Zoomers see shopping at physical stores as a form of ‘retail therapy’, which allows them to disconnect from the stress of social media and browse shelves and clothing racks in the real world. Brands can take the example of  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is continuing to open brick and mortar stores.Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) gives customers more flexibility by breaking up payments over weeks or months, and is also a trend that is now hugely popular with Gen Zers. In an uncertain economic climate, BNPL allows these young customers the flexibility to purchase their daily essentials, instead of going without. A leading example of this is Klarna, a hugely popular Swedish financial services company providing BNPL facilities to its users. Klarna’s obvious appeal for its Gen Z shoppers helped it snag a $45.6 billion valuation in a funding round led by SoftBank in 2021. Social shopping is another trend that is rapidly catching on in the U.S. Gen Z don’t view social media merely as a source of entertainment, but also depend on their trusted influencers to try out their desired products and give them feedback, upon which they will make their purchasing decisions. A product ad with a famous celebrity pictured on it just isn’t enough for them anymore. In 2021, the U.S. saw approximately 96.9 million social buyers and its popularity is only expected to grow. Social commerce sales in the U.S. were estimated at nearly $51.8 billion in 2022, and are predicted to reach $145.2 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 15.86% in the forecast period. With that said, here is a List of Favorite Brands of Gen Z in 2023.   Gen Z's 25 Favorite Brands in 2023magicinfoto / Shutterstock.comMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to several sources, including various subreddits and topics on Reddit, and then websites like YPulse, New York Post, Morning Consult etc., looking for the Favorite Brands of Zoomers in 2023. Then we assigned a score to these brands based on the number of times they appeared in the aforementioned sources and ranked them accordingly (in ascending order of high scores). When two brands had the same score, we ranked them according to their revenue for the year 2022. Gen Z's 25 Favorite Brands in 202325. DiscordInsider Monkey Score: 4Often dubbed ‘Slack for Gen Z’, Discord has evolved into the newest tool for brands to build and communicate to their communities and audiences. 65% of Gen Z feel more confident online with community-focused social apps, so Discord letting users create and monitor their own communities really helps. The gamification aspect of Discord additionally facilitates the entertainment interests and behaviors of Gen Zers. 24. Depop Insider Monkey Score: 4The next wave of luxury consumers, Gen Z are a fluid generation who crave flexibility and think second hand clothes are cool. Resale apps like Depop are globalizing Gen Z fashion culture through an international, digital shopping experience tailored to identity creation. Depop’s accessibility and endless range of products allow people to buy and sell fashion all over the world like never before. Depop was acquired for $1.62 billion by the e-commerce company Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) in 2021. 23. Apple PayInsider Monkey Score: 4Gen Z in the U.S. seem to have developed a liking towards the iPhone and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products in general. A new report by Financial Times indicates that 70% of people aged 18-24 in the U.S. already have an iPhone. Gen Z have a strong affinity for using digital wallets and with Apple ID, Apple Pay is available to users across multiple devices, making payment easier across multiple channels. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has therefore succeeded to tap into the Gen Z demand for products that are easy to use and communicate seamlessly – ensuring that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products are embedded into the everyday life of youngsters today. 22. TwitchInsider Monkey Score: 4Twitch is among Gen Z’s Favorite Brands in 2023 and the company burst onto the scene in 2005 as a real-time platform, where users could broadcast their daily lives. Although there are several other categories available on the platform, gaming remains the core of Twitch. With over 240 million monthly active users, Twitch is the market leader in the live streaming industry, with a 73% market share. The platform is a gold mine for Gen Z and Twitch’s internal data indicates that Twitch has the highest proportion of Gen Z users to total audience size – 55%. What’s even more interesting is the positive sentiment in the Twitch community for the monetization of channels and running ads, thus creating a massive opportunity for potential advertisers. 21. GatoradeInsider Monkey Score: 4According to YPulse’s Cooking and Diet Report, a quarter of Gen Z and Millennials are reaching for energy drinks on a typical day, but they’re also super conscious about what they put in their bodies. Gatorade launched their Fast Twitch drinks in February to reach young consumers who may shy away from energy drinks out of fear of their negative health effects. Fast Twitch includes 200 mgs of caffeine, zero sugar and select vitamins, and is designed as a healthy option for athletes.  Gen Z is tech-savvy, so Gatorade has responded to that with their Gx System product portfolio, including the Gx sweat patch, a mobile app and a ‘smart bottle’. 20. RedditInsider Monkey Score: 5Reddit is all about fostering community by encouraging its users to interact with each other. The platform is a hybrid between a forum and a modern social network – Subreddits are like individual forum sites, but you can participate in everything with one account, like a social network. The other big thing that sets Reddit apart is that instead of using complicated algorithmic tools to rank content, its algorithm runs on votes, simple and effective. Reddit continues to grow by double digits every year, adding 25% more users in 2020 and 14% in 2021. That growth, combined with 40% of Gen Z searching social media platforms for info instead of Google, makes Reddit a unique opportunity for brands. 19. Fenty BeautyInsider Monkey Score: 5Back in 2017, Fenty Beauty, by Rihanna, was created with the promise of inclusion for all women and launched with 40 foundation shades, consistent with their focus on inclusive beauty. They’ve since become the standard in cosmetic equality and representation. A quick look at Fenty’s Instagram feed shows a wide array of skin colors and culturally-diverse models. With its earth-conscious packaging, supple textures and irresistible scents, Fenty Beauty is not only among the Top Brands for Gen Z but also a favorite brand of millennials everywhere. 18. Twitter Insider Monkey Score: 5Twitter is one of the Brands Preferred by Gen Z in 2023 and the platform reaches 70% of 18-25 year olds. Twitter, more than anything, is about what’s happening, and that is one of the main reasons why they come to the platform. For them, Twitter is like a global newspaper that gives them a window to the world. It also gives them a space to be vocal, explore out loud, grow in public, stir things up, and of course, have a bit of a joke. 17. Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN)Insider Monkey Score: 5Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) targets young adults aged 18 to 30 through its unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment. As counterintuitive as it may sound, Gen Z is still very much active with in-store shopping and Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) is giving them what they want with their brick and mortar in-store experience. Moreover, the company understands that Gen Z want to stand out from conventional fashion trends, so it has catered to their needs with a long line of edgy and unique products.16. Playstation Insider Monkey Score: 5Research indicates that 95% of millennials and Gen Z play video games, with 80% doing so on video game consoles, and roughly half of these console game players prefer to play on a Playstation. Gen Z is much more accustomed to a ‘connected’ life and often look for community and a sense of belonging in their hyper-digital lives. Gaming consoles like Playstation give them an opportunity for relaxation and self-expression, and provide them with a huge international online community of fellow gamers that they can interact and bond with. 15. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Insider Monkey Score: 5With a user share of 83%, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the most popular online payment service in the U.S. Approximately 21% of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) users are between the ages of 18 and 29 and the popular digital wallet is the favorite brand of Gen Z for online payment solutions. With multiple preferred payment options, optimized processing, a mobile-friendly flow, BNPL, Venmo, and so much more, Gen Z customers may be attracted to the PayPal checkout experience. 14. DoritosInsider Monkey Score: 6Doritos has a clearly defined brand personality that resonates with the Gen Z audience. It is the ultimate party chip and no social event is complete without Doritos chips and salsa. Gen Z doesn’t like branding, so Doritos tried a new approach through their ‘anti-ad’, with the company dropping its logo and brand name from its advertising, social feed and packs to attract the younger, ad-adverse audience. 13. Snapchat Insider Monkey Score: 6Snapchat is used by approximately 58% of Gen Z and the brand delivers on the emotions that they seek, and it does so consistently across the platform in areas like Discover, Stories, and the Camera. Snapchat also launched its $3.99 monthly Snapchat + subscription last year, which enables members to use new features including the ability to boost stories, the ability to see who has rewatched their stories, and many more. When these young consumers are using Snapchat to conduct much of their social lives online, features like these can give subscribers the kind of advantage they crave. 12. H&amp;MInsider Monkey Score: 6H&amp;M is one of the favorite brands of Gen Z in 2023. The fast-fashion company, known for its focus on swiftly knocking off trends from the runway and selling them off at basement prices for maximum turnover, has started focusing more on circular fashion models, such as resale in the past few years. The retailer teamed up with Reflaunt to launch its own second-hand fashion platform in Canada, called H&amp;M Rewear. The brand has also launched a range of cruelty-free and vegan beauty basics for Gen Zers recently. 11. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Insider Monkey Score: 7Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is one of the Favorite Brands of Gen Zers in 2023 and they often turn to the retailer for personal care, household goods, clothing, accessories, and beauty private label items. The defining factor between the retailer and its Gen Z customer base is trust, an attribute that is hard to capture with the least brand loyal demographic. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has taken a number of steps to attract its Gen Z consumers, but there are a few attributes that really set it apart – its omni-channel approach, affordable pricing, product selection, and CSR initiatives. The Minnesota-based retailer comes in at number 7 for the top 100 retailers by sales in the U.S. in 2022, with $104.62 billion in revenue. If you want to read about the largest retailers worldwide, please refer to our article 20 Largest Retailers in the World.

RCL will likely benefit from strong bookings, digital initiatives and ship upgrades. This and the focus on enhanced destination offerings bode well. However, inflationary and supply chain challenges are a concern.Factors Driving GrowthShares of Royal Caribbean have surged 72.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 17% growth. The company has been benefiting from strong demand for its brands’ vacation experiences, strong close-in bookings (at higher prices) and the continued strength of onboard revenues.During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported solid demand for Caribbean itineraries, paving the path for improvement in load factors. As of Mar 31, 2023, North America-based sailings portrayed robust booking trends, contributing nearly 76% to the company’s capacity. RCL registered better-than-expected load factors, owing to a rise in close-in bookings. It also stated that pricing (including and excluding FCCs) remains elevated from 2019 levels. Also, it reported strength in European bookings, outpacing the 2019 level. Also, it stated benefits, courtesy of shifting of consumer preferences from goods to entertainment and travel spending (24% higher than 2019 levels) enhanced destination offerings and global sourcing model.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the full-fleet resumption and load factors at high prices (at approximately 102%), the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods. In 2023, the company anticipates solid guest generation from the North America region.Royal Caribbean continues using digital tools for marketing, product development and enhancing the consumer experience. The initiative is vital in enhancing customer preference, engagement, cruise frequency, guest experience and spending. The company introduced new technological capabilities under its Project Excalibur. It has also rolled out a smartphone app to increase convenience and better serve guests. Streaming WiFi, expanded onboard offerings, customized destination experiences and other ship upgrades are also paying off. The company emphasizes on enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing distribution channels to boost guest repeat rates and spending.The company focuses on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to differentiate its offering and deliver superior yields and margins. Moving into 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. The company stated that Icon will have eight distinct neighborhoods and that its stateroom configuration will enable load factors to be accretive to the overall portfolio. The company anticipates the ships to be significantly accretive to its key financial metrics.For 2023, RCL expects depreciation and amortization expenses between $1,465 million and $1,475 million, down from the prior stated $1,470-$1,490 million. Net interest expenses (excluding loss on extinguishment of debt) are projected at $1,290-1,300 million, down from the earlier mentioned $1,310-1,350 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to surpass the 2019 reported levels. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $4.40-$4.80, up from the prior stated $3-$3.60.Story continuesConcernsRoyal Caribbean has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the first quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses increased 51.3% year over year to $1,792.9 million. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from increases related to fuel and food costs.The company expects net cruise costs (excluding fuel per APCD) for 2023 to increase 5.5-6.5%, up from the previous expectation of 4.8-5.8%, from 2019 levels. The company also expects fuel costs to increase and continue through 2025. This includes expected transitory costs related to health protocols and one-time lagging costs related to the fleet ramp-up.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the real estate market, check out the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The real estate sector stands as a highly profitable industry globally, with its significance further emphasized by the interdependence between real estate development and some of the world's largest economies. Naturally, this also means that the industry is closely monitored by both governments and the wealthy. Encompassing various intricate facets, including the acquisition, sale, and administration of diverse properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces, the real estate industry involves a multitude of participants, ranging from real estate agents and brokers to property developers, landlords, property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions.According to a report, the global real estate industry was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021. Despite its substantial size, the segment is projected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030, reaching an estimated worth of $5.85 trillion by the conclusion of the forecast period. In addition to the residential sector, the commercial real estate (CRE) market constitutes a significant portion of the industry. More specifically, commercial real estate outperformed inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods and outperformed its own historical average in five of them. After enduring losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, returns in the CRE sector have experienced a partial recovery, accompanied by the resurgence of inflation. It is expected to mirror the overall growth rate of the sector, with a projected CAGR of 5.1% throughout the forecast period. Additionally, McKinsey states that commercial real estate returns have demonstrated strong performance over the seven inflationary periods spanning from 1980 to 2022, achieving an annualized rate of 11.7%. Notably, they have consistently outperformed inflation, and even outshined other asset classes such as the S&amp;P 500 and BBB corporate bonds.Story continuesHowever, all is not well in the CRE market. According to Bloomberg, the top US bank regulators are asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress in the commercial real estate market. With the sharp increase in borrowing costs, property owners are facing immense pressure, leading to defaults on debt by companies such as Brookfield Corporation. The situation is particularly challenging for office owners, as elevated borrowing costs make financing more difficult, and tenants are scaling back due to layoffs and the growing trend of remote work. According to the latest guidance, banks are advised to offer short-term loan accommodations to borrowers. These accommodations may involve deferring payments, accepting partial payments, or providing other forms of assistance. In this environment, lenders are now faced with challenging negotiations as approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate loans are due this year and next. Following this, major institutional owners including Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Brookfield and Pimco have already chosen to stop payments on some buildings, stating that they have ""better uses for their cash and resources"".The real estate industry is currently engaged in a significant debate regarding the future occupancy of vacant office buildings in various cities. As an example, cities such as San Francisco and Chicago are experiencing office vacancy rates approaching 25%. This has resulted in a decline of 50% in office real estate stocks compared to pre-Covid levels, while the REIT sector has experienced a 9.5% loss in the past year, in contrast to the S&amp;P 500's 14.5% gain. However, it's important to note that offices now represent only 3.4% of the $1 trillion public market for real estate investment trusts (REITs), and the broader REIT space is not facing the same level of challenges.On the other hand, the residential real estate (RRE) market seems to be faring somewhat better. Following a significant decline in new home prices, which dropped by 10% from their highest levels reached in February 2023, the prices are on an upward trend with the latest reading of April 2023. Furthermore, the regional housing index provided by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo contributes to this positive trend. The most recent reading for June indicates a sixth consecutive month of growth, with the index standing at 55.

Most notably, investors looking to delve into the real estate market should be prepared for the ways online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology will impact all aspects of real estate transactions. Based on a report, investors can anticipate an increase in competition among property listing websites in the near future, all striving to facilitate seamless buying and selling experiences for aspiring and current property owners. While platforms such as Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long held a dominant position in the market, new and similar platforms will continue to emerge, further intensifying the competition. Technology will seemingly play a substantial role in the future of the real estate market, and major players will learn to maneuver the market accordingly, or they risk lagging behind the competition, of which there is plenty.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best commercial real estate stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc.

One dollar donated can abolish, on average, $100 of medical debt because debts are acquired for a fraction of their face value.I'm proud that Regions Bank's contributions have continued to help reduce this hardship for individuals and families in our communities.Leroy Abrahams, head of Community Affairs at Regions BankWhen the medical debt is in their possession, rather than collect it, RIP Medical Debt erases it.To date, the company has helped more than 6 million individuals and families by paying off more than $9 billion in medical debt.""We were so pleased with the results of our community partnership with RIP Medical Debt last year that we made the decision to make a second investment,"" said Leroy Abrahams, head of Community Affairs at Regions Bank. ""Medical debt is a serious issue - it's the number one reason people declare bankruptcy in our country. I'm proud that Regions Bank's contributions have continued to help reduce this hardship for individuals and families in our communities.""Story continuesRegions Bank's commitment to this critical issue goes beyond financial investment. In March 2022 the bank launched a set of financial education tools through Regions Next Step, the bank's no-cost financial education program. The courses on navigating medical debt were specifically designed to help people and families address urgent issues surrounding unpaid medical bills.Last October, Regions made the courses available to other financial institutions wanting to help address this national problem, and those banks are now also sharing the courses with their own customers.Regions also recently announced the results of a survey conducted by Regions Next Step about the scope and impact of medical debt.Key findings included:Two in five people have experienced an unexpected medical event in the last year and, among those, seven in 10 found it difficult to pay for it.For those with medical debt, seven in 10 respondents had debt that is either overdue or in collections.Due to the cost of medical bills in the last year, nearly one-quarter of Americans has either used all their savings to cover the expenses or has been contacted by a collection agency due to medical bills.These results align with some grim statistics from a recent Kaiser Family Foundation report that found more than 100 million people in America have medical debt, for a total of nearly $200 billion. A quarter of adults with health care debt owe more than $5,000. And about one in five with any amount of debt said they don't expect to ever pay it off.Debt is most widespread in the South, according to the Urban Institute. And that played a major role in Regions' decision to take action on this issue - because so many people in the communities the bank serves are being negatively affected.""We were very intentional about directing the funding to areas of our footprint with the highest share of adults struggling to pay their medical debt,"" Abrahams said. ""We understand how the enormity of this hardship can have a negative impact on every part of people's lives - as well as that of their families. Helping to improve the financial lives of people in our communities benefits everyone and increases the health of our local economies.""Fortunately, all the news reports and public discussions are not all bad news. Some are resulting in actions to help ease the burden. In April, the three major credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion - announced that medical collections with balances of $500 or less would no longer appear on consumer credit reports.Small victories are important when it comes to tackling big issues like medical debt.Regions Bank is committed to doing our part: And abolishing $22 million in debt for almost 20,000 people is a great start.Regions Bank, Monday, July 10, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/766559/Regions-Bank-Committed-to-Reducing-Medical-Debt]"

Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.

You can skip our detailed analysis on poverty in the United States, and head over directly to the 10 States with the Lowest Poverty Rates in America.Poverty rate in the United States has continued to steadily decline over the last decade. 11.2% of the population lived below the poverty line, $27,479 for a family of four, in 2021, compared to 14.8% in 2011, according to the Census Bureau. In terms of demographics, communities most affected by poverty in order are the Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics. Similarly, geographically, there are states that are poorer than some of their wealthy counterparts.New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate in the US among all 50 states. It is followed by Minnesota and New Jersey at second and third on the list of states with the lowest poverty rates. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Mississippi is the poorest state in the US having the highest poverty in the country with a population of 18.1% living below the poverty line.The United States is divided by its stark income inequality. One factor why poverty rates are low in some states compared to others is significant corporate presence in these states which leads to production of jobs and economic opportunity. This factor also indicates that these states are business friendly and have optimal economic policies in place.Maryland is one example. It is not just among the states with the lowest poverty rates, but is also one of the wealthiest states in America in terms of household income. There are at least 10 billionaires and more than 220,000 millionaires in the state.The world's largest hotel chain, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.

It was founded in 1886 in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where it still has its corporate head office. The consumer division of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is located in Skillman. The company is part of the Fortune 500 list of companies in the US having the highest revenue. Merck, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Cognizant are other prominent companies that are headquartered in the state, and contribute to the region's economic success.Virginia, which is in our list of states with the lowest poverty rates, has some of the biggest defense companies based in the state. One of them being the aerospace and armament manufacturer, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) which is headquartered in Reston. It is one of the largest defense contractors of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2022, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had a revenue of close to $40 billion, and received more than $21 billion in DoD contracts. You can read more about the biggest companies in Virginia in our article here.At the same time, several corporations such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) are also undertaking voluntary initiatives to accelerate economic growth in areas with high poverty rates. TechSpark, a program launched by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), to provide digital access and skills to residents of rural areas has enabled 88% of the schools in Northeast Wisconsin to offer Computer Sciences education, which bodes well for their future career prospects.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Employee Giving Program, which started in 2011 has already raised $880 million for people going through difficult times such as stress, poverty, or violence. The company matches dollar payments contributed by its employees in this cause, and also raises money in the pool for every hour volunteered by an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee to help those in need.Another fine example is that of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), which is one of the leading financial institutions in the United States.

162,d95154e9-ef90-36aa-9a8c-da250f34cf80,KLAC,2023-07-11,Institutional investors may overlook KLA Corporation's (NASDAQ:KLAC) recent US$4.0b market cap drop as long-term gains remain positive,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-overlook-kla-140104112.html,1688997664,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in KLA implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price50% of the business is held by the top 16 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$4.0b last week. However, the 48% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about KLA. See our latest analysis for KLA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About KLA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in KLA. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see KLA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. KLA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of KLAWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that KLA Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$91m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand KLA better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - KLA has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Yahoo Finance Live examines the stock action surrounding these two trending stocks.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Novavax surging after the biotech company saying that it will receive $350 million from Canada to settle a fortified-- forfeited, excuse me, vaccine doses that were previously scheduled to be delivered here. But, Akiko, we might be seeing a brief bounce here in the stock today because we know Novavax has raised some red flags just about the viability of their business, their ability to continue making revenue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, given the fact that demand for vaccines is down. And this is the only product that they have brought here to consumers.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, the only product in what? 35 years, one out there. I mean, so, you know, a 30% bounce there, but, you know, worth noting that Canada can essentially terminate this contract with Novavax if they don't necessarily get regulatory approval for some of the production there. So there's still some question marks around it, but, you know, hey, the 30% jump, at least for one day, certainly welcome news for investors of Novavax.Fox stock hit with a downgrade from Wells Fargo over ecosystem risk surrounding Fox News. Shares there are down more than 1% here. There's a number of factors here at play, Seana. There's the cord cutting, number one, which is something that we have seen a lot of cable outlets have to deal with.There is also that the face of the network really shifting with Tucker Carlson leaving, or at least getting the boot. And so, you know, I mean, how do we read this stock? It's tough to say how much of this is Fox-specific, how much of it is a broader trend that we're seeing. How do you break it down?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think it's almost more of a broader trend that we are seeing when it comes to cord cutting because the fact that we're still up 11% year to date, given the fact that Tucker Carlson did leave. I think a lot of people have almost moved beyond that. And we have seen Fox News depart with some of its biggest names in the past.They are largely able to keep their base, keep the very, very loyal fans that they have. So I think that the broader issue with Fox going forward is the ongoing cord cutting and what that exactly looks like, how that is reshaping the industry as a whole. And when it comes to those ecosystem risks that Cahill was talking about in this report, he was just focusing on the fact that most of Fox's earnings are a result of Fox News earnings.So when anything happens there, it could potentially pressure the company going forward. Obviously, cord cutting, a massive issue here and something that they are not alone with in trying to figure out how exactly to best deal with this and shift their consumer base to online.]"

Yahoo Finance Live discusses what may have led to the decline and what a potential slowdown in consumer spending may mean for Disney.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: i want to continue talking about travel and where consumers are and are not spending because one surprising thing that you might find at Disney World this summer is shorter lines.There's a new study showing that the crowds at the Magic Kingdom are thinning out just a bit. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal here with a closer look. Allie, what are we seeing people, I guess, aren't willing to spend?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, it could be a variety of factors. There was a new set of data out from a company called Touring Plans. They track wait times. And they showed that the 4th of July holiday was relatively quiet across the board at Disney's domestic theme parks in both Florida, California, along with some of those rival theme parks like Universal.According to that data, Walt Disney World saw average July 4th wait times hit 27 minutes at Magic Kingdom, 18 minutes at Hollywood Studios. And if you've ever been to Disney World, you know those times are very manageable. They were also significantly lower compared to both last year and 2019.But again, this July 4th slowdown in particular could be due to a variety of factors. It's very hot in Florida right now. We also saw a lot of pent-up revenge travel last year, perhaps consumers waited a bit to go on their Disney World vacations. The data did note that on July 5th and July 6th that wait times did perk up a bit. So there's a lot of things at work here.But I will say Disney overall has been doing different things to try and trim or slow down the amount of people at the Park since those customers were complaining about those lengthy wait times. They've raised prices on some of those theme park entries. They brought back the annual passes. They have a new reservation system. So all that to say that we'll see what happens down the line.Story continuesDisney has hinted that there's going to be a bit of a contraction at theme park attendance this quarter, especially when you compare it to last year when we had that 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World. But. that's going to be a big thing for their earnings since the parks are so heavily tied to Disney's bottom-line. So a lot of analysts are a bit concerned about that.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a lot of analysts are concerned just about the, I guess, less people traveling to the parks. But I think the big issue and what everyone is trying to figure out right now is how much pricing power a company like Disney, or the airlines, or the hotels still have, because, yes, they were able to raise prices exponentially during the pandemic in the year or two following the pandemic as we move-- hopefully here-- continue to move beyond the pandemic.But, I guess, what does that mean in terms of their power now? Because we are certainly starting to see consumers pull back. The risk of recession, sticky inflation, they don't have as deep of pockets as they had--BRAD SMITH: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: --the last two years.BRAD SMITH: I mean, well, look my booked flight schedule for the rest of this year-- and even looking at into next year-- still accounts for me moving past this pandemic and many other consumers as well. And so all of that considered, yes, 100%. It comes back to your point around where some of these companies in the profit-led inflation portion of the broader kind of move through the inflationary environment that we're at right now, where companies have increased prices to try and protect profits, where they're continuing to pass that through to consumers and creating a viable type of excuse to do so.Or something that sounds reasonable to the consumer, but at the same time is making sure that they're able to continue their operations as is. And that can come in many different forms, especially when you think about the airlines, because there's so much murkiness with what goes on behind the scenes.Typically, passengers are just thinking about how much they're spending on their luggage, what they're taking on the plane with them, how much that fare costs, and then what it's going to cost them to get throughout the rest of their experience even past their passenger experience to get to or from a destination as well.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and it's the add-on pricing too at the airlines.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I just booked a euro trip. And I was looking at the fine print--SEANA SMITH: Which is expensive right now.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Very expensive right now. I used a heck a lot of credit card points. But if you want to take some of those, you know, budget airlines, you have to pay $75, $100 to bring a carry on--BRAD SMITH: Yes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And that's the fine print there. And you have to wonder too if the Fed does raise rates by another 25 basis points. I don't think-- I think more companies are going to continue to raise prices to try and protect those margins. So I don't think that we're going to see the end of price increases anytime soon.And when that happens, you do wonder at what point does a consumer stop spending.- Well, and Allie and Brad, you guys are talking about all these costs before you even get to the destination, right? I mean, if you look at a name like Disney, is anybody surprised that people are pulling back when it costs more than $100 to get in?I mean, you think about a family of four, that is so pricey. And I wonder, Allie, if this kind of points to a breaking point? We've been talking so much about the consumer power, that there is pent-up demand. They still want to travel and yet this seems to suggest that there is a ceiling at which they're willing to walk away from.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and that's a big concern for Disney. You know, in the last quarter, they relied heavily on their international park exposure. And now we're seeing this bit of a contraction on the domestic side. And like I said, the parks business really has been the lifeline for Disney especially over COVID.We still have direct-to-consumer not profitable. There are very-- There are a lot of issues surrounding sports, ESPN. The parks has been this beacon for Disney. And if you start to see that slow down, if people were not going and spending at the parks, that is clearly going to eat into those margins. And you have to think that that's something that Bob Iger and the entire Disney leadership team is thinking about very closely.]"

OKE is well poised to gain from increasing volumes in its pipelines and fee-based commitments as production volumes rise. The company’s expansion efforts and pipeline additions are expected to strengthen its position in high-production regions and aid future earnings.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face risks related to strong competition in the pipeline business.TailwindsONEOK is poised to benefit from long-term fee-based commitments in all three of its segments. More than 90% of its 2022 earnings was fee-based. A substantial portion of its 2023 earnings is expected to be fee-based too.The company continues to invest in organic growth projects to expand its business in the existing operating regions. It plans to provide a broad range of services to crude oil as well as natural gas producers and end-use markets. Capital expenditures (including maintenance) totaled $289 million in the first quarter compared with $257 million in the year-ago period.OKE expects total capital expenditures in the $1,270-$1,480 million range in 2023. This indicates that systematic investments are necessary to expand infrastructure to keep up with the expected increase in producer activity.ONEOK is expanding its storage capabilities in Oklahoma, adding 4 billion cubic feet of storage capacity. The project is expected to be completed in early 2023 and is nearly 90% subscribed through 2029. The company is planning to further increase its storage assets in Texas to cater to the rising demand in the region.HeadwindsThe natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline industries are expected to remain highly competitive. Apart from the existing pipeline companies, this midstream section has recently seen many energy companies forming master limited partnerships to begin pipeline services.Although OKE’s assets are well spread out, its ability to withstand competitive challenges will depend on the efficiency, quality and reliability of its services.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the same sector are Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, Evergy, Inc.

I thought of the unlimited possibilities that the 8.3 million Americans who can't yet connect to broadband Internet will begin to have thanks to the Biden administration's historic announcement today allocating billions to connect everyone.President Biden and Vice President Harris announced the allocation of $42.5 billion in federal funds, which will be granted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories. This once in a generation investment, made possible by bipartisan congressional action, will enable broadband to get to the places it isn't today. Policymakers and the private sector have been working to bridge the digital divide for decades, since I was serving in the Clinton administration. But never have we seen this pairing of public and private funding to truly complete the job.At Comcast, we've already been working coast to coast on new deployments into areas that don't have Internet - and you can see some of those stories here including new network expansions, investments and buildouts in Lackawanna County, PA; Plainfield, CT; Colbert County, AL; eight counties in Georgia; 19 counties in Indiana; the communities of Kingwood, Pinehurst, Prairie View, Waller, New Caney and Conroe, Texas; Chattaroy and Key Peninsula, WA.These areas now have the unlimited possibilities the internet can bring - seeing a doctor who is across the country via telehealth, taking a job training course remotely to get a better job, connecting to family far away or becoming an entrepreneur, coder, filmmaker.Unlimited possibilities aren't possible if there isn't broadband infrastructure. That alone is not enough. We also need resources to get and keep connected the many who have access but may have issues around adoption - like affordability and lack of digital skills. This where the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) and Digital Navigators are so vital.Story continuesTwo weeks ago, the White House highlighted the ACP with a week of action, and we together with so many others stepped up - this month we'll host or participate in over 100 events aimed at ACP awareness and enrollment for eligible people.Comcast is the founding partner of the Online For All campaign with Civic Nation and the U.S. Department of Education, with the goal of reaching millions who still remain unconnected with the power of the Internet. The ACP has been a big success already with 18.5 million families now getting help with their broadband costs through the program. So many more are eligible, and we need to continue efforts across the board. Digital Navigators are key to getting these folks connected and will be a focus of this campaign.Yesterday, I had the honor of joining a discussion at the Aspen Ideas Festival with Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and Administrator of NTIA, Alan Davidson. He noted that, on top of the infrastructure investment, there is also $3 billion that will be used for digital equity and opportunity programs across the country. Alan called this a ""generational moment"" to bring the essential communications medium of our time to everyone. I agree wholeheartedly and look forward to unlimited possibilities broadband can provide to everyone.Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy and Executive Vice President, Digital Equity for Comcast Corporation.Comcast Corporation, Monday, July 10, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/766525/White-House-Announces-Historic-Funding-to-States-That-Will-Close-the-Broadband-Access-Gap]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the data storage industry, head directly to 5 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now. Fortune Business Insights predicts that the worldwide data storage market will experience substantial growth, increasing from $247.32 billion in 2023 to $777.98 billion by 2030. This growth is expected to occur at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8% throughout the forecast period. The growing adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud-based services, and data analytics is fueling the growth of the data storage market. This year, industry experts forecast a spike in the adoption of object storage. To maintain a competitive edge, businesses are likely to reassess storage tiering and cloud solutions, aiming to trim their environmental footprint by adopting more compact and energy-efficient options. Additionally, automation is expected to grow as organizations strive to attain their sustainability and efficiency objectives. According to Brent Ellis, a senior analyst at Forrester Research: “Object storage pairs very well with cloud-native application development, because you don’t actually need a storage driver to address it. You can just address an S3 bucket directly, which means you can span multiple locations in very interesting ways.”Don't Miss: 25 Biggest Cloud Providers by RevenueObject storage stores and manages data as discrete, self-contained units, and unlike traditional file or block storage, object storage provides unlimited scalability. Rick Vanover, a senior director at backup vendor Veeam, explained the benefits of object storage: “Companies have a lot of data they really care about, and object storage has a lot of features that really help protect it, like immutability and archive storage classes. It provides a great combination of security capabilities and tiering and managing the lifecycle so organizations can have great cost/performance and security.”Story continuesThe cloud storage market is undergoing big moves. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s plan to split its cloud unit into a standalone entity has raised concerns about its long-term prospects due to higher regulatory scrutiny and extensive competition. Analysts suggest that external investment and separation from Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s primary e-commerce business could support international expansion, particularly to compete with industry giants like Amazon Web Services. However, others speculate that the Chinese government may invest in the cloud unit or it could become a private entity, given its leadership in the domestic cloud computing industry. Such changes could also improve AliCloud's market share in China, where growth is primarily driven by government and state-owned enterprises that have been slower to make the shift to cloud services. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s cloud computing division announced in May 2023 that it will invest $13 billion in India by the end of this decade, as it is one of Asia's quickest growing economies. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s decision aligns with India’s plans to attract larger investments in the digital sector to meet the growing demand for data storage and services from corporations and government entities. To benefit from the advancements and growth potential in the data storage industry, investors can pick up stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also provides cloud-based storage through iCloud, we did not include the stock on our list since it is primarily compatible with Apple devices only. Our MethodologyWe selected the following data storage stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Data Storage Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: ralwel / 123RF Stock PhotoBest Data Storage Stocks to Buy Now10. Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) is a California-based provider of data storage technologies, products, and services. On May 31, Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) reported GAAP earnings per share of -$0.22, beating market consensus by $0.02. The revenue of $589.31 million also outperformed Wall Street estimates by $30 million. The company announced a year-over-year increase of approximately 30% in revenue from subscription services as well as in the annual recurring revenue (ARR) generated by subscriptions.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG), compared to 39 funds in the last quarter. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.26 million shares worth $185.2 million. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. 9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology corporation that provides on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions. It is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. On June 26,International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reached an agreement to purchase Apptio, an enterprise software company, from Vista Equity Partners for $4.6 billion. The deal is anticipated to be finalized in the second half of 2023. By combining Apptio's offerings with IBM's IT automation software and Watson AI platform, clients will have access to a comprehensive solution for optimizing all their technology interests.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 49 hedge funds were bullish on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), compared to 43 funds in the earlier quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 680,290 shares worth $89 million. Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), a data analytics and systems monitoring company, is one of the best storage stocks to invest in. With Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)’s storage solutions, users can securely store and manage large volumes of data generated by their applications, systems, and infrastructure. On May 4, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 and a revenue of $482 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $12.99 million, respectively. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 64 hedge funds held stakes worth approximately $1.9 billion in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.4 billion. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $192 million. RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an enterprise information technology company that provides storage solutions, networking, enterprise servers, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, management software, and related customer services. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. On June 12, the company declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on July 26, to shareholders of record on July 12. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 67 hedge funds were bullish on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared to 65 funds in the prior quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 20.6 million shares worth $1.9 billion. Ariel Focus Fund made the following comment about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Additionally, global leader in enterprise software, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) traded higher in the quarter, driven by solid quarterly earnings, a material increase in the dividend as well as forward looking guidance that implies a substantial acceleration in organic cloud growth for full year 2023. We believe these results highlight ORCL’s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company’s cloud platform as a competitive offering.”6. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures, and commercializes memory and storage products worldwide. The company’s operations are divided into four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit. On June 28, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) declared a $0.115 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 74 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a significant position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $259 million. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the premier data storage stocks to watch. Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party's over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today15 Best Coding Games to Learn Programming for Beginners25 Best Work from Home Jobs for 2023 Disclosure: None. 10 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined nearly 2%, while S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively.Minutes from the Fed’s June meeting were released, confirming the prevailing fear that although most officials agreed on the rate-hike pause, they also felt the need for further hikes in the upcoming months. Economic data from the labor market showed that job growth was decelerating, but wage levels remained strong. From a trade perspective, this was not good news, as it meant the Fed would hang on to its hawkish stance.The curve’s inversion between the U.S. 2-year and 10-year treasury note yields reached a four-decade high. Usually, this signals imminent recession. Investors are currently expecting and pricing in a 25 bps rate hike in July’s Fed meeting and eagerly awaiting the second-quarter earnings season.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the real estate market, check out the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The real estate sector stands as a highly profitable industry globally, with its significance further emphasized by the interdependence between real estate development and some of the world's largest economies. Naturally, this also means that the industry is closely monitored by both governments and the wealthy. Encompassing various intricate facets, including the acquisition, sale, and administration of diverse properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces, the real estate industry involves a multitude of participants, ranging from real estate agents and brokers to property developers, landlords, property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions.According to a report, the global real estate industry was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021. Despite its substantial size, the segment is projected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030, reaching an estimated worth of $5.85 trillion by the conclusion of the forecast period. In addition to the residential sector, the commercial real estate (CRE) market constitutes a significant portion of the industry. More specifically, commercial real estate outperformed inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods and outperformed its own historical average in five of them. After enduring losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, returns in the CRE sector have experienced a partial recovery, accompanied by the resurgence of inflation. It is expected to mirror the overall growth rate of the sector, with a projected CAGR of 5.1% throughout the forecast period. Additionally, McKinsey states that commercial real estate returns have demonstrated strong performance over the seven inflationary periods spanning from 1980 to 2022, achieving an annualized rate of 11.7%. Notably, they have consistently outperformed inflation, and even outshined other asset classes such as the S&amp;P 500 and BBB corporate bonds.Story continuesHowever, all is not well in the CRE market. According to Bloomberg, the top US bank regulators are asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress in the commercial real estate market. With the sharp increase in borrowing costs, property owners are facing immense pressure, leading to defaults on debt by companies such as Brookfield Corporation. The situation is particularly challenging for office owners, as elevated borrowing costs make financing more difficult, and tenants are scaling back due to layoffs and the growing trend of remote work. According to the latest guidance, banks are advised to offer short-term loan accommodations to borrowers. These accommodations may involve deferring payments, accepting partial payments, or providing other forms of assistance. In this environment, lenders are now faced with challenging negotiations as approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate loans are due this year and next. Following this, major institutional owners including Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Brookfield and Pimco have already chosen to stop payments on some buildings, stating that they have ""better uses for their cash and resources"".The real estate industry is currently engaged in a significant debate regarding the future occupancy of vacant office buildings in various cities. As an example, cities such as San Francisco and Chicago are experiencing office vacancy rates approaching 25%. This has resulted in a decline of 50% in office real estate stocks compared to pre-Covid levels, while the REIT sector has experienced a 9.5% loss in the past year, in contrast to the S&amp;P 500's 14.5% gain. However, it's important to note that offices now represent only 3.4% of the $1 trillion public market for real estate investment trusts (REITs), and the broader REIT space is not facing the same level of challenges.On the other hand, the residential real estate (RRE) market seems to be faring somewhat better. Following a significant decline in new home prices, which dropped by 10% from their highest levels reached in February 2023, the prices are on an upward trend with the latest reading of April 2023. Furthermore, the regional housing index provided by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo contributes to this positive trend. The most recent reading for June indicates a sixth consecutive month of growth, with the index standing at 55.

Most notably, investors looking to delve into the real estate market should be prepared for the ways online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology will impact all aspects of real estate transactions. Based on a report, investors can anticipate an increase in competition among property listing websites in the near future, all striving to facilitate seamless buying and selling experiences for aspiring and current property owners. While platforms such as Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long held a dominant position in the market, new and similar platforms will continue to emerge, further intensifying the competition. Technology will seemingly play a substantial role in the future of the real estate market, and major players will learn to maneuver the market accordingly, or they risk lagging behind the competition, of which there is plenty.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best commercial real estate stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the data storage industry, head directly to 5 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now. Fortune Business Insights predicts that the worldwide data storage market will experience substantial growth, increasing from $247.32 billion in 2023 to $777.98 billion by 2030. This growth is expected to occur at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8% throughout the forecast period. The growing adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud-based services, and data analytics is fueling the growth of the data storage market. This year, industry experts forecast a spike in the adoption of object storage. To maintain a competitive edge, businesses are likely to reassess storage tiering and cloud solutions, aiming to trim their environmental footprint by adopting more compact and energy-efficient options. Additionally, automation is expected to grow as organizations strive to attain their sustainability and efficiency objectives. According to Brent Ellis, a senior analyst at Forrester Research: “Object storage pairs very well with cloud-native application development, because you don’t actually need a storage driver to address it. You can just address an S3 bucket directly, which means you can span multiple locations in very interesting ways.”Don't Miss: 25 Biggest Cloud Providers by RevenueObject storage stores and manages data as discrete, self-contained units, and unlike traditional file or block storage, object storage provides unlimited scalability. Rick Vanover, a senior director at backup vendor Veeam, explained the benefits of object storage: “Companies have a lot of data they really care about, and object storage has a lot of features that really help protect it, like immutability and archive storage classes. It provides a great combination of security capabilities and tiering and managing the lifecycle so organizations can have great cost/performance and security.”Story continuesThe cloud storage market is undergoing big moves. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s plan to split its cloud unit into a standalone entity has raised concerns about its long-term prospects due to higher regulatory scrutiny and extensive competition. Analysts suggest that external investment and separation from Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s primary e-commerce business could support international expansion, particularly to compete with industry giants like Amazon Web Services. However, others speculate that the Chinese government may invest in the cloud unit or it could become a private entity, given its leadership in the domestic cloud computing industry. Such changes could also improve AliCloud's market share in China, where growth is primarily driven by government and state-owned enterprises that have been slower to make the shift to cloud services. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s cloud computing division announced in May 2023 that it will invest $13 billion in India by the end of this decade, as it is one of Asia's quickest growing economies. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s decision aligns with India’s plans to attract larger investments in the digital sector to meet the growing demand for data storage and services from corporations and government entities. To benefit from the advancements and growth potential in the data storage industry, investors can pick up stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also provides cloud-based storage through iCloud, we did not include the stock on our list since it is primarily compatible with Apple devices only. Our MethodologyWe selected the following data storage stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. 9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology corporation that provides on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions. It is one of the best data storage stocks to invest in. On June 26,International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reached an agreement to purchase Apptio, an enterprise software company, from Vista Equity Partners for $4.6 billion. The deal is anticipated to be finalized in the second half of 2023.

Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 680,290 shares worth $89 million. Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), a data analytics and systems monitoring company, is one of the best storage stocks to invest in.

(NASDAQ:DDOG), compared to 63 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.4 billion. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $192 million. RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”7.

Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 20.6 million shares worth $1.9 billion. Ariel Focus Fund made the following comment about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Additionally, global leader in enterprise software, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) traded higher in the quarter, driven by solid quarterly earnings, a material increase in the dividend as well as forward looking guidance that implies a substantial acceleration in organic cloud growth for full year 2023. We believe these results highlight ORCL’s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company’s cloud platform as a competitive offering.”6.

Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party's over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today15 Best Coding Games to Learn Programming for Beginners25 Best Work from Home Jobs for 2023 Disclosure: None. 10 Best Data Storage Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Dickson is credited with reinventing Barbie and making the brand more in line with cultural trends in his work at Mattel over the last five years.Mattel is betting that the cultural conversation around Barbie materializes in strong profit figures, created in a few different ways.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend the World Premiere of ""Barbie"" on July 09, 2023, in Los Angeles, California.

Mattel, for instance, inked a Barbie apparel deal with specialty retailer Gap (GPS) that hit stores on May 23.The product line ranges from pink Barbie hoodies to pink pet clothing.Fast fashion house Forever 21 has also released a Barbie-inspired clothing line.""I think what really becomes more interesting as you see the Barbie brand evolve is from a character into a platform and ultimately a franchise,"" Dickson said. ""And so from toys to lifestyle products to live experiences, digital gaming, now film, you really start to see the manifestation and the monetization of the power of this incredible franchise.""Story continuesDancer Kim Manning performs a routine to promote the film ""Barbie"" at the WeHo Pride Parade in West Hollywood, Calif., on Sunday, June 4, 2023.

Crum's previous sales estimate stood at $325 million.""Barbie is the first of several movie releases from Mattel Films, with a stated mission to be an IP-driven toy business, and thus we see a successful launch as driving greater confidence around this part of the company's strategy,"" Crum said. ""And a higher box office = higher profits for Mattel ~ since the company did not fund production our estimates (including adj. EPS = $0.08) are admittedly modest, but a stronger showing in theaters certainly can't hurt numbers.""And lastly, a successful Barbie debut could validate the 14 other content projects in development for Mattel, including a Warner Bros. movie based on the toy car brand Matchbox.CEO of Mattel, Ynon Kreiz, arrives at the premiere of ""Barbie"" on Sunday, July 9, 2023, at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Key Growth DriversThe company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In first-quarter 2023, global comps increased 12.6% compared with a rise of 11.8% reported in the prior-year quarter. This marks the nineth consecutive quarter of comps growth. In the first quarter, comps in the United States, international operated markets and international developmental licensed segment rose 12.6% each, respectively. The company benefited from robust performance in Germany, the U.K., France, Australia and Canada. McDonald’s’ comps in the quarter benefited from a menu price increase, positive guest counts and marketing initiatives. This and the continued digital and delivery growth contributed to the upside.The company's strategic efforts in the international markets continue to drive comps higher. It is constantly trying to improve its performance in the International Operated Markets, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. The company intends to drive comps growth in these markets through the introduction of value meals, customizing the menu to local customer tastes, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery and digitalized presence.McDonald's continues to gain from robust digitalization. During the first quarter, the company reported accelerated digital engagement across the markets. It reported more frequent visits and incremental sales on the back of tailored loyalty messages, a strong lineup of mobile app offers and content offerings. During the first quarter of 2023, digital sales (from top six markets) rose 30% year over year to $7.5 billion. This contributed almost 40% to MCD’s system-wide sales. Given a rise in digital adoption, the company is optimistic and anticipates the initiatives to drive sales and average checks in the upcoming periods.  The company is focused on expanding its global footprint to drive growth. It believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding its presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance. It is planning to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023, including 400 openings in the United States and the IOM segment and 1,500 (including nearly 900 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the real estate market, check out the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The real estate sector stands as a highly profitable industry globally, with its significance further emphasized by the interdependence between real estate development and some of the world's largest economies. Naturally, this also means that the industry is closely monitored by both governments and the wealthy. Encompassing various intricate facets, including the acquisition, sale, and administration of diverse properties such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and industrial spaces, the real estate industry involves a multitude of participants, ranging from real estate agents and brokers to property developers, landlords, property managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and financial institutions.According to a report, the global real estate industry was valued at $3.69 trillion in 2021. Despite its substantial size, the segment is projected to achieve a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% from 2022 to 2030, reaching an estimated worth of $5.85 trillion by the conclusion of the forecast period. In addition to the residential sector, the commercial real estate (CRE) market constitutes a significant portion of the industry. More specifically, commercial real estate outperformed inflation in six of the seven inflationary periods and outperformed its own historical average in five of them. After enduring losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, returns in the CRE sector have experienced a partial recovery, accompanied by the resurgence of inflation. It is expected to mirror the overall growth rate of the sector, with a projected CAGR of 5.1% throughout the forecast period. Additionally, McKinsey states that commercial real estate returns have demonstrated strong performance over the seven inflationary periods spanning from 1980 to 2022, achieving an annualized rate of 11.7%. Notably, they have consistently outperformed inflation, and even outshined other asset classes such as the S&amp;P 500 and BBB corporate bonds.Story continuesHowever, all is not well in the CRE market. According to Bloomberg, the top US bank regulators are asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress in the commercial real estate market. With the sharp increase in borrowing costs, property owners are facing immense pressure, leading to defaults on debt by companies such as Brookfield Corporation. The situation is particularly challenging for office owners, as elevated borrowing costs make financing more difficult, and tenants are scaling back due to layoffs and the growing trend of remote work. According to the latest guidance, banks are advised to offer short-term loan accommodations to borrowers. These accommodations may involve deferring payments, accepting partial payments, or providing other forms of assistance. In this environment, lenders are now faced with challenging negotiations as approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate loans are due this year and next. Following this, major institutional owners including Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Brookfield and Pimco have already chosen to stop payments on some buildings, stating that they have ""better uses for their cash and resources"".The real estate industry is currently engaged in a significant debate regarding the future occupancy of vacant office buildings in various cities. As an example, cities such as San Francisco and Chicago are experiencing office vacancy rates approaching 25%. This has resulted in a decline of 50% in office real estate stocks compared to pre-Covid levels, while the REIT sector has experienced a 9.5% loss in the past year, in contrast to the S&amp;P 500's 14.5% gain. However, it's important to note that offices now represent only 3.4% of the $1 trillion public market for real estate investment trusts (REITs), and the broader REIT space is not facing the same level of challenges.On the other hand, the residential real estate (RRE) market seems to be faring somewhat better. Following a significant decline in new home prices, which dropped by 10% from their highest levels reached in February 2023, the prices are on an upward trend with the latest reading of April 2023. Furthermore, the regional housing index provided by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo contributes to this positive trend. The most recent reading for June indicates a sixth consecutive month of growth, with the index standing at 55. See also our list of the 10 Best Residential Real Estate Stocks To Buy.The real estate industry is currently experiencing transformative shifts due to technological advancements and enhanced capital availability. Most notably, investors looking to delve into the real estate market should be prepared for the ways online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology will impact all aspects of real estate transactions. Based on a report, investors can anticipate an increase in competition among property listing websites in the near future, all striving to facilitate seamless buying and selling experiences for aspiring and current property owners. While platforms such as Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long held a dominant position in the market, new and similar platforms will continue to emerge, further intensifying the competition. Technology will seemingly play a substantial role in the future of the real estate market, and major players will learn to maneuver the market accordingly, or they risk lagging behind the competition, of which there is plenty.With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best commercial real estate stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), and Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD).12 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Fundsyoussef-abdelwahab-qyzo7TDSVQs-unsplashOur MethodologyWe selected the following real estate stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

217,d65e5798-09e2-32bb-b96a-f4c809c4e96f,UPS,2023-07-11,Consultant: Strike could cost UPS 30% of diverted volume,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consultant-strike-could-cost-ups-210901760.html,1689035838,STORY,"['UPS', 'FDX']","[UPS could see 30% of diverted volume disappear, consultant says (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)UPS Inc. should be prepared to lose as much as 30% of diverted volume should the Teamsters strike the company by the end of the month and a work stoppage last for a decent duration, a leading parcel consultant said Monday.UPS handled about 18.6 million parcels in the U.S. per day in the first quarter. Under a contingency plan, it expects to handle 4 million parcels on its own. The balance of about 14.6 million parcels, most of which would be ground deliveries, would be subject to diversion.Satish Jindel, president of consultancy ShipMatrix, said in a communique to FreightWaves that the 30% of volume that could be lost would be equivalent to more than 4 million parcels a day.Because there are about 80,000 package car drivers and each driver delivers about 230 parcels per day, the diverted volume, if it never returns to UPS (NYSE: UPS), could result in 4,300 lost driver jobs and those of a few thousand package handlers for every 1 million packages diverted, he said.Unlike the last Teamster strike in 1997, there is plenty of competition for diverted volume. For example, FedEx Corp., (NYSE: FDX) whose ground unit didn’t exist back then, is delivering on-time performance for air and ground on par with UPS, according to Jindel. This will give shippers more confidence to keep diverted volumes with FedEx, he said.On Sunday, the U.S. Postal Service launched “Ground Advantage” with two-to-five-day transit times comparable to FedEx and UPS. Jindel envisioned a scenario in which large shippers divert lightweight parcels under 5 pounds that can fit in a mailbox to the Postal Service and the heavier parcels to FedEx.The potential damage to UPS and its unionized workers behooves both sides to return to the table and resume negotiations, Jindel said. Talks collapsed last week reportedly over an inability to come to terms on part-time wages. No new talks are scheduled. The current contract expires July 31.“Being very tough in negotiations is analogous to stretching a rubber band,” Jindel wrote. “No one knows the full limit before it snaps and then one has to start all over again with a new set of conditions.”Story continuesSeparately, for the minority of Teamsters union members at UPS who don’t favor a strike should a contract not be agreed to in three weeks, the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation on Monday issued some advice.All UPS employees can resign their membership in the union and continue to do their jobs, according to a legal notice issued by the foundation. “If you don’t support the union you can send the union a letter resigning your membership at any time,” the notice said.In addition, employees who resign their membership — or who are already nonmembers — have the right to work even if the union orders a strike. “Union officials can — and often do — fine union members thousands of dollars for working during a strike,” the notice said. “So you should seriously consider resigning your union membership before you return to work during a strike, which is the only way to avoid fines and discipline.”Employees working in a “right-to-work” state, where union membership and financial support are voluntary, can resign their membership and opt out of all union financial support, according to the notice.Employees not working in a state with those protections have the right to opt out of paying dues for union politics and may be able to avoid other union financial support, according to the notice. In non-right-to-work states, unions can still only mandate that employees pay dues as a condition of employment if the union and management have finalized a union monopoly bargaining contract that contains a valid forced-dues clause, the notice said.About 97% of UPS’ members have voted to authorize a strike if a contract is not reached by July 31. The Teamsters represent 340,000 UPS employees, many of them part-timers.The post Consultant: Strike could cost UPS 30% of diverted volume appeared first on FreightWaves.]"
218,25763a6d-9b5c-36cc-ada3-8382015ff00c,UPS,2023-07-11,Amazon Prime Day: How a potential UPS strike could boost sales,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-prime-day-potential-ups-214340352.html,1689025420,VIDEO,"['UPS', 'AMZN']","[Amazon's Prime Day sales event kicks off on Tuesday. Burt Flickinger, Managing Director at Strategic Resource Group, tells Yahoo Finance Live how the e-commerce giant could see a bump in sales due to concerns about a potential strike by UPS workers.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Amazon's Prime Day kicks off tomorrow, July 11th. And our next guest is expecting strong sales and deep discounts. For more on what to expect, we want to bring in Burt Flickinger. He's Strategic Resource Group Managing Director.Burt, it's good to see you. So there has been this ongoing debate about the health of the consumer, the consensus of the consumer right now given all the headwinds. What do you think Prime Day is going to tell us just about where the consumer stands today?BURT FLICKINGER: Prime Day is going to tell us that the consumer is looking for the best bargains in history, because 64% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Food stamps or SNAP benefits have just been cut significantly.Post-COVID and travel is getting more expensive and more difficult as AAA's reported record travel delays during the 4th of July holiday week in the US and Canada. So people want affordable luxuries. And they'll be able to afford more of them with Amazon Prime Day this week, as you said, tomorrow and the following day.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, interesting that you mentioned that the weakness and some of the headwinds that consumers face are actually going to lead to a big bump for Amazon.The other thing that you've said you're watching very closely is this UPS strike. I'm curious to hear what you think about that and how that's going to give a bump, because is that necessarily what consumers are watching right now?BURT FLICKINGER: Consumers are watching it because you and other worldwide networks are reporting it so well. UPS represents about 35%, 37% of Amazon's shipments, but it also represents shipments to hundreds of different retailers in LTL or less-than-truckload.Story continuesAnd the Teamsters have not struck Amazon since 1997 good-- or struck UPS delivering for Amazon since 1997. But the Teamsters have a dynamic new leader, Sean O'Brien, who does not do contract extensions and will not settle with the Hoffa family settled for was 2% to 3% annual wage increases. So we expect a work stoppage.Consumers expect the same thing so consumers will buy in advance to get back to school or back to school essentials-- shoes, clothes, books, and supplies-- to make sure there's something when the kids go back to school next month in August.SEANA SMITH: So, Burt, you're saying consumers are closely paying attention to this. And maybe you slightly inserted there. But more specifically, I guess, what are retailers doing? Are they ordering ahead? What changes are they making to their supply chains in anticipation or to better position themselves if we do see a strike?BURT FLICKINGER: Our retailers are ordering ahead. And they're caught between the proverbial Scylla and Charybdis, because they're just coming off of what you and Akiko reported so well in terms of the supply chain shortages for over 1,000 days.They're just finding their footing from that. And now they have to advance shipments because of the potential UPS Teamsters strike. Full disclosure, I was a member of the Teamsters as a second job, working my way through high school and college and road delivery. And when they're off the road, the national economy really gets crushed.AKIKO FUJITA: Burt, so let's talk about what exactly the deals are going to look like. Because as you point out the last Prime Day in the fall was a bit of a disappointment when you compare it to how things were in July. So how significant do you anticipate the discounts to be, and where will they be focused on?BURT FLICKINGER: Akiko, great insights as usual. And the discounts will be primarily consumer electronics, consumer audio, and especially tech. And as you referenced, Amazon did about $12 billion in Prime Day last July. But in Prime Days in October, did about 8 billion.Meanwhile Alibaba worldwide did about $40 billion in one day, November 11th in 2022. So Amazon's got to, one, close the gap versus Alibaba. Two, close the deficit from last October that you referenced.And, third, close the gap that Whole Foods has been disappointing since the acquisition in 2017, and they have to offset those sideways sales and land-based retail with more Amazon e-tail and to coincide with the tremendous press of Amazon growth of AWS or Amazon Web Services to your good points.SEANA SMITH: Burt, what about the resumption of student loan payments? We know investors are keeping a close eye on that. Just on what this means for other retailers, but what it means for Prime Day. Is that something that you expect to affect this year's event or it's something that you see more of affecting 2024 Prime Day?BURT FLICKINGER: Seana, expect to affect Prime Day this year. And one thing I missed is Amazon's really going to focus on both wearables and electronics as well as consumables.It's the path to growth, because consumers are paying the highest prices in history-- especially the highest prices in food-- so Amazon online is going to really accelerate and challenge Kroger, Albertsons Walmart, Costco target who all have the majority of their sales in consumable food and beverage and other consumable categories.Amazon's really going to step up this year. So one can stock his or her entire apartment or home with edibles, wearables, and everything for electronics and technology too.SEANA SMITH: Well, we will see what those sales numbers look like. Burt Flickinger, thanks.]"

Sykes also likes Interactive Brokers for its growth potential. Sykes also tells Yahoo Finance Live why he is less of a fan of PacWest Bancorp and Coinbase.Video Transcript- Great to talk to you today. I want to start with your picks. We'll start on a positive note here. American Express, one that you're really liking. You say it's all about return on equity. Walk me through your thesis.MAC SYKES: Right. So-- I mean, this is, as we all know, a wonderful brand, top performing management, at a company in the financials industry that's come into the year projecting over 15% top-line growth, and that's in spite of potentially challenging economics in the back half of the year.And that's being driven by the strength of their clients, which is millennials, small businesses, and the return to travel, which is a big part of their business as well. So we see good opportunity for them this year. Good visibility. The company hitting on all cylinders. And resilient against what could be a little bit more challenging economy going forward.- Mac, if we do see a recession, though, are they still going to be able to-- maybe they'll be able to weather it better than some of their peers out there, but, I guess, how does that then position that company given the pullback that we could see?MAC SYKES: Right. So I don't think they're immune to any kind of economic malaise. I mean, they would certainly see billings decline. But if you look at when they came out of the pandemic, they were very smart about their business model. They adjusted it for the cost, and they ramped up spending in the back half, and they positioned them for growth going forward.So first, I would say they have a resilient customer base, as I mentioned before. Number two, they can adjust their business accordingly in terms of costs and so on. And three, they understand these cycles and have shown an ability to manage through them.Story continues- Another name that you're liking, Interactive Brokers here. You point specifically to the steadiness, the steady growth that you have seen there, in such a choppy environment. What else do you like in that name?MAC SYKES: So, I mean, this is a history of very successful execution over a number of years. You have a founder, Thomas Peterffy, who's just done a tremendous job building shareholder value here. And in my opinion, it's in secular growth. They have two million accounts. It's a global business mode and discount brokerage. So well respected for their capabilities globally. A very significant TAM against that. A growing accounts at 20% plus.They had two major wins in terms of the international white labeling space, which will have an acceleration in the metrics, which we saw in the last month. They're well capitalized at $12 billion, so plenty of capital to continue that growth. And then you have margins at 70%. So you retain a lot of capital and just drive a nice business.- Mac, let's get to some of the plays that you're saying that people should avoid right now. One of those picks is Pac West. Obviously, a name that's been caught up in the volatility that we've seen in the regional banks. Why don't you think the worst is behind them yet?MAC SYKES: Well, I just highlight Pac West, but it's really kind of a bellwether for some of the smaller and regional banks. And I think those will be more challenged in general. We've seen the inverted yield curve, we've seen the rise in deposit costs. I mean, deposit cost there almost 290 versus 13 basis points a year ago in the first quarter. So it's pretty dramatic impact of the cost of funding, and we're seeing that across the space.You have higher regulations coming forward. And you also have kind of the other impacts as well. So the ROEs could be challenged and the visibility is going to be difficult. So I just think there are better places to put your money to work with a little more visibility and a little less tough conditions.- What specifically are you expecting around regulation? And to what extent-- how significant do you anticipate the pullback to be as a result of it?MAC SYKES: So I think they're looking at a number of areas. I mean, specifically, also the smaller banks who, typically, not been as well regulated. So there'll probably be some more tests in terms of the stress and maintenance and understanding their balance sheet, et cetera.But also a big focus will be on HTM, as we know, because we've seen some embedded losses in a lot of these firms. And there are certain capital holes with them that they're trying to get out of as well. So I think there will be stricter regulations across several different areas of the businesses. All in all will impact their return on equity and their costs going forward. And that will kind of bring down expectations and impact the models.- Mac, another name that you're advising investors avoid is Coinbase. A stock that's actually done relatively well, given the number of headwinds that's up against the stock right now. Not to mention some of those regulatory concerns of those headwinds. What do you think the next couple of months looks like for Coinbase?MAC SYKES: Right. Again, not to pick on Coinbase, but it's just an area that we just don't focus on. We have an appreciation, which is what happened in the cryptocurrency space, and their leadership there. They've obviously built a big business, $20 billion market cap. But the company is not profitable at this point. So kind of off the radar for us.And then, as we know, they've kind of been in a fight with the regulatory authorities and how to regulate the business, to regulate those instruments, et cetera. So I think there's a lot of uncertainty there in terms of how the business will go going forward. And again, this is just not an area we focus on. We look for cash generative businesses, predictability, the outcomes going forward, in terms of regulations et cetera. So that's why we're more attuned to businesses like American Express and Interactive Brokers.- Mac Sykes, a portfolio manager at Gabelli funds with his picks and icks, as we like to call it.

Its shares declined 0.7% on Jul 7, replicating declines in broader markets.Amex Shop Small will offer an opportunity for the Cardmembers to access a widespread local merchant network of more than 30,000 this year. The Cardmembers can use their registered American Express Card to avail a HK$10 statement credit on the pursuit of a single transaction worth HK$50 or more at participating merchants. The reward can be obtained for a maximum number of three times at three different store locations till the end of September 2023.Cardmembers can also enjoy some savings from the usage of their American Express Card through Jun 30, 2024. On a single transaction of HK$150 or more on regular-priced or à la carte food and beverage products at participating merchants, Cardmembers will be entitled to an instant savings of HK$20 at the checkout point.While bridging the gap between customers and merchants can be marked as a longstanding endeavor for the Amex Shop Small campaign, it tends to fetch an additional benefit this time in the form of a new program for Hong Kong’s business owners.American Express collaborated with the Hong Kong Retail Management Association to roll out Shop Small Academy, which provides participating merchants free access to complimentary learning and networking opportunities. This, in turn, enables merchants to stay abreast with the current market environment and provides them an opportunity to enhance their business prospects. The intent to benefit Cardmembers and business owners of Hong Kong seems to be in sync with American Express’ efforts to capitalize on the rebounding business environment and consumer sentiment observed across the region. Also, AXP has always remained steadfast in chasing continued technological upgrades and launching safe digital solutions to ease the economic activities of small businesses.American Express often resorts to enhancing benefits or incorporating new options within its card offerings, thus catering to the evolving needs of the global consumer and commercial customer base.

This innovative test is poised to revolutionize the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD), bolstering Quanterix's business in the growing neurology space.More on LucentADThis test aims to assist healthcare providers in evaluating patients who show cognitive symptoms consistent with the early signs of AD. By measuring an isoform of phosphorylated tau protein in plasma, the LucentAD test provides clinicians with a simplified process to quickly assess the likelihood of a patient having amyloid pathology associated with AD.The significance of the LucentAD test lies in its ability to aid healthcare providers in determining appropriate follow-up and treatment planning for patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease. The test is run by Quanterix's CLIA laboratory, which powers many clinical trials related to AD. It utilizes the Simoa p-Tau 181 assay, a highly specific test that has been extensively studied in large cohorts. The reliability and clinical validity of the test have been established through comparisons to the gold standard for AD diagnosis, amyloid positron emission tomography. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBuilding a Global Alzheimer's Disease Testing InfrastructureQuanterix's strategic move to launch Lucent Diagnostics, a healthcare provider-facing portal, and make the LucentAD test available through the CLIA laboratory demonstrates the company's commitment to expanding access to AD testing worldwide. With the recent FDA approval of Leqembi, the first disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer's, the need for a robust global infrastructure for patient testing has become more urgent than ever. Quanterix aims to fill this gap by offering its cutting-edge testing solutions to healthcare providers, democratizing access to Alzheimer's disease therapies.Story continuesMarket ProspectAccording to a research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), the global Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic market is projected to reach $7,100 million, at a CAGR of 8.90% during the forecast period of 2022-2030.The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease worldwide is a significant driver of the market.

The increased capacity expansion derived from Chemed’s hiring and retention program is driving VITAS’ admission growth. The company’s favorable solvent position at the first quarter-end of 2023 buoys optimism.However, escalating expenses and high dependence on government programs do not bode well for Chemed.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 5.6% compared to the 7.6% fall of the industry and a 14% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned hospice care provider has a market capitalization of $8.11 billion. Chemed projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 8.8% compared with 10.6% of the industry. CHE’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 0.94%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesRoto-Rooter Continues to Expand: Chemed’s Roto-Rooter segment continues to be well-positioned, with the ongoing demand for key services in commercial and residential segments significantly above the pre-pandemic level. Both branch commercial and residential revenues improved in the last reported quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement anticipates that the segment’s market share will continue its upward trend, banking on the company’s core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time and 24/7 call centers and internet presence.VITAS’ Prospects Look Bright: In the first quarter of 2023, the year-over-year revenue increase in the VITAS Healthcare business segment included a 3% rise in days of care and a geographically-weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 2.9%.Chemed implemented a targeted hiring and retention bonus program at VITAS in July 2022. In the first quarter, VITAS increased its licensed healthcare staff by 200 professionals, with the majority being licensed nurses, expanding to 475.Story continuesStrong Solvency: Chemed remains well-capitalized having exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $58.1 million. The total debt at the end of the first quarter was $21 million, much lower than the current cash level.With the reported short-term payable debt at the quarter end being $5 million, the company holds sufficient cash for short-term debt repayment during the economic downturn. Further, the CHE’s quarter-end dividend payout rate of 7.7% seems sustainable, sequentially up from 7.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.DownsidesDependence on Government Mandates: The Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasing pressure to control healthcare costs and cut or limit increases in reimbursement rates for healthcare services. Like most government programs, these are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, possible retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions.With more than 95% of VITAS’ revenues consisting of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, all of these may adversely affect the level of program payments and have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.Escalating Expenses: Chemed lagged earnings and revenue estimates in the first quarter. Mounting costs and expenses weighed on the company’s margins.The persistent macroeconomic headwinds related to volatility in COVID-19 trends, rising inflationary pressure and other challenges continue to hamper business performance.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chemed’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $20.77 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.26 billion.

237,33e2c96e-da06-33b9-ac5e-a4fedfd48724,BSX,2023-07-11,Here's Why Investors Should Hold Align Technology (ALGN) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-hold-align-150700378.html,1689001620,STORY,"['ALGN', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Align Technology, Inc. ALGN has been gaining from Invisalign portfolio expansion. ALGN’s slew of strategic alliances looks impressive. However, economic uncertainty and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 32.1% compared with 19.8% growth of the industry and a 15.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $25.22 billion. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate of 17.2% is ahead of the industry’s anticipation of 12.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversInvisalign Portfolio Expansion: Align Technology’s Invisalign portfolio offers orthodontic treatment to straighten teeth without metal braces.During first quarter, ALGN launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in most markets. Instead of unlimited additional aligners within five years of the treatment end date, this latest configuration offers Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of treatment end date.The initial adoption of the product garnered a positive response. Management expects that its impact will be more meaningful and provide doctors with desired flexibility. Further, this will allow the company to recognize deferred revenues over a shorter period of time compared with the traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.Strategic Alliances: Align Technology's slew of strategic alliances looks promising. It has well-established relationships with many DSOs, especially in the United States, and is continuously exploring collaboration with others that drive adoption of digital dentistry. Recently, it announced a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring first quarter, ALGN delivered 7.8 billion impressions and had 22.1 million visits to its websites. IT continues to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube across markets.iTero in Focus: Align Technology has been focusing on expanding work-flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In first quarter, services revenues increased year over year. This was primarily driven by higher subscription revenues resulting from large number of iTero scanners in the field. The company also had higher non-systems revenues reflecting increased scanner rentals, upgrades and certified pre-owned or CPO leasing programs.Earlier in 2022, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs. The iTero Element Flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for Desktop Labs and will connect dentists directly with a suite of offerings from Desktop Labs.Story continuesDownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. It also competes with productions similar to Invisalign Technology, such as products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Economic Uncertainty: The general slowdown in the United States and certain international economies is having a negative impact on consumer spending and affecting Align Technology’s business fundamentals. ALGN attributed the waning earnings to this macroeconomic crisis that affected the overall dental market and led to continued soft dental sales of the company. Dental procedures are primarily elective in nature and are deferred when unemployment levels rise.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Align Technology’s 2023 earnings has moved 4.1% north to $8.31 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALGN’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.89 billion, suggesting a 4.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

DGX recently partnered with Proov, a manufacturer of at-home fertility and hormone tests, to offer the Proov Confirm PdG home collection kit for evaluating fertility available to women. The tests are aimed toward women who intend to start or grow a family through questhealth.com.The Proov Confirm PdG test is the first and only PdG (progesterone metabolite) home test kit to confirm successful ovulation that has been approved by the FDA.The latest move will expand Quest Diagnostics’ portfolio of testing services, fortifying the Diagnostic Solutions business.More on PdG TestThe PdG test is the first women's health test offered through questhealth.com that was manufactured by a different company. The Proov Confirm home collection kit can be purchased now on questhealth.com for $29. It involves a urine test, similar to an at-home pregnancy test, with results in 5-10 minutes.The PdG test is the first women's health test from a third-party manufacturer available through questhealth.com. In addition, users can also download the free Proov Insight app to receive reminders to test, gain help in interpreting results and personalize an action plan.Benefits of PdG TestA reproductive hormone called progesterone aids in preparing the uterine lining for implantation and pregnancy. The implantation window is the period after ovulation when progesterone levels should be raised to promote implantation. Pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), the main urine metabolite of progesterone, is designed to be detected by the Proov Confirm PdG test and can be used as a tool to help confirm ovulation. The ""implantation window"" is a four-day period where PdG levels in the urine are measured to determine whether ovulation was successful.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccording to the Centres for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, up to one in five women have fertility problems. It is recommended that women with ovulation problems consult with a healthcare professional about possible causes of the problem. For individuals who have tried unsuccessfully to get pregnant, the test might be appropriate. Women who have experienced previous infertility problems, PCOS, endometriosis, are 35 years of age or older, or who are using fertility drugs may also find it helpful.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global Fertility Test Market size was valued at $462.23 million in 2020, and is projected to reach $842.96 million by 2028, registering a CAGR of 7.8%. Fertility test market growth is attributed to rise in the prevalence of diseases such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) as women with the condition of PCOS do not ovulate each month regularly due to the overproduction of estrogen by the ovaries.Recent DevelopmentsIn June 2023, Quest Diagnostics completed its previously-announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. The acquisition is intended to improve patient outcomes through early, accurate detection of residual or recurring cancer. By combining its strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing with Haystack's liquid biopsy technology, DGX will likely dominate the rapidly-expanding MRD sector.The same month, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Coriell Life Sciences to provide select medical plan members with pharmacogenomics testing services. The test indicates how different genes and their variants affect an individual’s reaction to drugs. The pharmacogenomics test is a voluntary, no cost DNA-testing programme that uses a saliva collection kit that can be used at home to analyze a person's DNA. The effectiveness of the patient's existing drugs is evaluated in light of the test results.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 3.8% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 7%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.57bUS$2.89bUS$3.50bUS$3.55bUS$3.60bUS$3.65bUS$3.72bUS$3.79bUS$3.86bUS$3.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.41%Est @ 1.62%Est @ 1.77%Est @ 1.87%Est @ 1.94%Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.1%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$34bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$57b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$52.3, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.952. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Boston Scientific, we've compiled three additional items you should further examine:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for Boston Scientific  you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for BSX's future outlook?

240,2ec88869-abeb-3ab3-8be9-2c1dffa9cccb,VRTX,2023-07-11,Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Latest Stock Performance Being Led By Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporateds-nasdaq-vrtx-110102360.html,1689073262,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:VRTX) stock is up by 6.0% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:23% = US$3.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 23%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 23% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 33% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is VRTX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether VRTX is currently mispriced by the market.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $22.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Textron will provide aircraft maintenance as well as engineering services for eight UH-1Y and four AH-1Z aircraft.The contract will serve the government of the Czech Republic. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Namest, Czech Republic.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe increased defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunitions of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2027.To this end, it is imperative to mention that the Bell unit is currently developing a new rotorcraft, the Bell 360 Invictus, for the U.S. Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Competitive Prototype Program, which is also part of the U.S. government's FVL initiative.As of December 2022, the 360 Invictus was nearly complete, and the company expects its first flight in 2023, pending delivery of the ICAP engine. Further, the unit’s first super medium commercial helicopter, the 525 Relentless, is currently in the certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration.Story continuesOnce these helicopters are marketed, Textron can be expected to gain more from the expanding military rotorcraft market.The growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft for U.S. armed forces, along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations. Some of its products are CH-53K, S-92, UH-60 Black Hawk etc.LMT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.2%. Its shares have risen 9.4% in the past year.Boeing’s portfolio of helicopters comprises of the AH-6 Little Bird, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey and H-47 Chinook aircraft and in-development entrants, which include the MH-139A Grey Wolf and DEFIANT X. Its military rotorcraft is currently used by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as allied defense forces in more than 20 countries across the globe.BA’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 17.9% from the 2022 reported figure.Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout is a combat-proven, autonomous helicopter system providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target-acquisition, laser designation and battle management for tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. It has two variants — MQ-8B Fire Scout and MQ-8C Fire Scout.NOC has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

Major stock indexes achieved several milestones during this period. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite exited the bear market and formed a new bull market in first-half 2023. The S&amp;P 500 recorded its best half in four years while the Nasdaq Composite posted its best first-half in 40 years.Consequently, most of the stocks surged during this period. This was a reversal from 2022, when most of the U.S. stocks plummeted as the pandemic-era fiscal incentives were withdrawn and the Fed pursued tight monetary control with rigorous increases in the benchmark interest rate.As a result, Wall Street started 2023 with an overall undervaluation of equity markets. The steady decline in the inflation rate from its peak on June 2022 and the Fed’s reduction of the magnitude of interest rate hike also favored U.S. stock markets.However, several stocks did not participate in dream rally of first-half 2023. Many of these stocks are set to roll in the second half. At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt;$40 billion) with negative returns in stock prices in the first half of 2023. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

HON is benefiting from recovery in commercial flight hours and strength in advanced materials and UOP businesses. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and cost-control measures continue to drive HON’s top line. The company’s bullish forecast for 2023 holds promise. HON’s deal to acquire Compressor Controls will be beneficial going forward.Story continuesHoneywell International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.Humana Inc.’s HUM Medicaid business benefits from several contract wins and renewals, thereby contributing to its top line. Strategic buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth in the future. HUM’s revenues for 2023 are expected within $104.4-$106.4 billion.Solid contributions from the Insurance and CenterWell segments bode well for HUM. We expect Medicaid revenues to be $7.6 billion in 2023. Management estimates 2023 EPS to be at least $28.25, reflecting at least 11.9% growth year over year.Humana has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 11.8%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 0.4% over the last seven days.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP posted first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics improved year over year. Results have gained from continued brand strength and significant pricing.KDP has been witnessing continued momentum in the Refreshment Beverages segment for a long time. KDP witnessed market share expansion above 88% of its cold beverage portfolio. This mainly reflected strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks.Keurig Dr Pepper has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.6% and 10.9%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023).

KO and Clorox CLX.3 Stocks Tailored Toward a Defensive ApproachCurrently, the Zacks Consumer Staples sector is ranked in the top 25% of all Zacks Sectors, indicating that companies within have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions.Those in the sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies' products possess an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.In addition, many also pay dividends, providing the cherry on top for those with a preference for income.Three stocks from the realm – Lamb Weston, The Coca-Cola Co. and Clorox – could be worth adding to your radar. All three presently carry a favorable Zacks Rank and are low-beta, with the latter helping to tame volatility. Let's take a closer look at each for those seeking a more defensive approach.Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. The company has also invested in healthier alternatives such as coffee, sparkling water, and sports drinks.KO's 43% trailing twelve-month return on equity is certainly worth highlighting, indicating that the company has efficiently generated profits from existing assets relative to other peers in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector.The company is a member of the elite Dividend Kings club, reflecting an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased payouts. Shares currently yield a solid 3% annually with a payout ratio sitting at 73% of earnings.Lamb WestonLamb Weston, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a leading global manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of value-added frozen potato products. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions for some time, with the trend particularly noteworthy for its current fiscal year.Story continuesLamb Weston has been a big-time earnings performer, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of nearly 50% across its last four quarters. The company delivered a sizable 45% EPS beat in its latest print and reported sales 6% above expectations.The company's sales growth has been strong as of late.Keep an eye out for LW's next quarterly release expected on July 25th; the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.06 suggests a 60% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. The quarterly estimate has been revised marginally higher over the last several months.CloroxClorox, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), markets some of the most trusted and recognized brands, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products. Similar to LW, the revisions trend has been notable for Clorox's current fiscal year, with the quarterly EPS estimate up 2% just over the last several months.In addition, the company sports an inspiring growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar 11% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 25% in FY24. Revenue growth is also apparent, forecasted to see growth of 2% in FY23 and 3% in FY24.It's worth noting that value-conscious investors may not find CLX shares as attractive, further reflected by the Style Score of ""F"" for Value. Shares currently trade at a 35.1X forward earnings multiple, well above the five-year median.Bottom LineStocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies' products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.And all three companies above could be great considerations for those seeking a more defensive approach.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 1.9% gain over the past four weeks.MHK has been benefiting from strategic initiatives, global presence in the business and accretive acquisitions. It has implemented multiple price increases in most product categories to cover inflation, which is expected to improve margins in coming quarters.This flooring maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40.1%.

253,6bb19afc-ac33-3e48-9f44-daed49566738,WM,2023-07-11,The Returns At Waste Management (NYSE:WM) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-waste-management-nyse-wm-110050220.html,1689073250,STORY,['WM'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Waste Management, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$31b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Commercial Services industry average of 8.5% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Waste Management roceIn the above chart we have measured Waste Management's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Waste Management.What Can We Tell From Waste Management's ROCE Trend?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 13% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 46% in that time. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...The main thing to remember is that Waste Management has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 123% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Waste Management   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:DVA), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine DaVita’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for DaVita What Is DaVita Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 18.82x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 23.09x, which means if you buy DaVita today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe DaVita should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. In addition to this, it seems like DaVita’s share price is quite stable, which could mean there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s trading around the price multiples of other industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from DaVita?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. DaVita's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 44%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? DVA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at DVA? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DVA, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for DVA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing DaVita at this point in time.

SoCalGas' The Evolution of Clean Fuels in California Reliability Analysis expands on the company's 2021 Clean Fuels Study (CFS) finding that infrastructure development for the delivery of clean fuels like hydrogen could support critical power generation and drive further adoption of clean fuels solutions for other hard-to-electrify sectors in California.

""This updated analysis provides new insights into how California can achieve net-zero emissions in 2045 without sacrificing grid reliability as electric demand grows.""By evaluating every hour in a year to model the potential for an electric system outage, the analysis produced more robust results and additional insights into what circumstances can cause the grid to experience periods of strain.Story continues""Early investment in clean fuels infrastructure could be key to supporting a reliable and resilient energy grid that is adequately prepared for future conditions,"" Malik continued. ""Due to the long lead times required for infrastructure development, the analysis underscores how the prioritization of immediate investment in the clean fuels network could be vital in helping California reach its long-term energy needs and decarbonization goals.""SoCalGas is a leader in sustainability, having been among the first and largest natural gas utilities in the United States to announce its aim to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. The company was awarded the top ""Business Transformation Award"" at Reuters Events' 2022 Responsible Business Awards for having established truly transformative sustainability priorities with the potential to create impact at scale in the energy sector and beyond.Toward that end, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved SoCalGas' request to track costs for advancing the first phase of the Angeles Link project, which could be the nation's largest clean renewable hydrogen pipeline system and support significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from heavy-duty trucks, power generation, industrial processes, and other hard-to-electrify sectors of the Southern California economy. Angeles Link, the [H2] Innovation Experience, and more than a dozen hydrogen demonstration projects SoCalGas is currently pioneering, are all part of its ongoing efforts to help accelerate California's energy transition.Read more on how clean fuels infrastructure can help accelerate decarbonization efforts while supporting electric reliability in SoCalGas' The Evolution of Clean Fuels in California Reliability Analysis.

The U.S. left the door open for a new application.But Brouillette said that because the company has already produced LNG, he is confident the request to approve a fourth processing unit, called Train 4, will not face the same resistance encountered by Energy Transfer.The Cameron LNG facility in Hackberry, Louisiana, began initial startup in 2018 and has been producing gas from three units. A fourth train when completed would add up to 6.75 million tons per year of the chilled gas to its existing 12 MTPA capacity.""We have partners who are in fact the developers and the offtakers of our gas. We think those commercial arrangements will cause DOE to look differently at this project as opposed to others,"" Brouillette said in an interview on the sidelines of the LNG 2023 conference in Vancouver, Canada.Cameron LNG is owned by affiliates of Sempra Energy, TotalEnergies, Mitsui &amp; Co and Japan LNG Investment LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corp and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha.

Tier two suppliers of Airbus and Boeing are now looking at India ... we are in talks with them,"" Behramkamdin told Reuters.There are a lot of opportunities in supplying for the structure of the aircraft and there are also large titanium requirements, he said, adding there will also be demand for maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts.Godrej Aerospace already exports some key components to engine makers General Electric (GE) and Rolls-Royce, Behramkamdin said after a media tour of its plant in Mumbai.The company expects its civil aviation business to clock revenues of 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in the current fiscal year, making up 35% of Godrej's total revenues, he said in an interview, adding that he expects this to grow to 50% next year.India has been pushing for indigenous manufacturing as well as local sourcing of components for aerospace and defence, and companies like Airbus and Boeing have recently committed to more local manufacturing and investment.Godrej Aerospace will also pitch to manufacture modules of GE 414 engines and become part of the supply chain for the work horses that will power the next generation of Indian fighter jets.Under a deal announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the U.S. last month, the engines will be made jointly by GE and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).Godrej Aerospace said separately in a statement it is planning to invest 2.5 billion rupees ($30 million) to build a new facility in Khalapur in Maharashtra for advanced manufacturing and assembly and integration facilities.(Reporting by Dhwani Pandya in Mumbai; Writing by Aditi Shah and Sethuraman NR; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Alexander Smith)]"

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal break down the calendar.Video Transcript- We've got a big week ahead of us-- important data, the start of second quarter earnings season, a lot to consider. Joining us now to cover all of it, Yahoo Finance reporters Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal. Josh, let's start with you. Give us the calendar here. What's on the docket?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, we got a more full calendar this week, guys. I'm excited about the calendar this week. Some weeks, we come in and we're not fired up about the calendar. We're fired up about this calendar because it's the start of earnings season.Right now, we're looking at the economic calendar right there. You can see you have the Fed Beige Book on Wednesday, CPI also on Wednesday, and then of course, consumer sentiment, the first reading of that University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment for July, expected on Friday. But I'm really fired up for earnings season to start too. We have bank earnings on Friday, and then you also have Delta reporting on Thursday, and Pepsi also expected to report on Thursday.But I think a key theme when you think about this week is really what have the interest rate hikes started to do to the economy. And when you think about what have they started to do to the financial system, how are they dealing with those high interest rates, and then how are they impacting inflation and CPI. Allie, I know that's something you've been following closely. Looks like those headline numbers are sort of expected to fall pretty heavily in that report on Wednesday.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, inflation expected to slow down, but it will still remain significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That along with the strong jobs report that we got on Friday, which showed unemployment low, wages high suggests that there will be more rate hikes to come. So here are the expected CPI numbers according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesWe see headline inflation expected to have risen 3.1% on a year over year basis in June. That is a slowdown from May's 4% rise with monthly inflation expected to tick up to 0.3%. Then if we take a look at core inflation, that strips out the more volatile pricing of food and gas. That's expected to have a yearly rise of 5%. Yet another slowdown compared to May with monthly core prices hitting 0.3%.According to a new note from Citi, the slowdown is expected to come from two things-- the deceleration of shelter pricing, which has long been expected, along with a decline in used car prices. That has remained stubbornly high. But we're expected to see that come down in this print and continue to come down through the back half of 2023 and into 2024. But again, guys, this is not enough to convince the Fed to pull back on those rate hikes.All the analyst notes that I've been reading pretty much expect on that Fed meeting on July 26 that they will raise rates by another 25 basis points. Markets are pricing this in as well. Data from CME group has about a 93% chance of that. And there is some expectation that we could see more rate hikes through November. But that's all going to depend on the data.The Fed has consistently said it's data dependent. CPI is a critical part of that data set. So we shall see.- By the way, we said nothing of note-- WD-40 reports after the close today. I'll be curious to see how they do. I'm not even kidding.JOSH SCHAFER: Good consumer brand.- Good consumer brand. I mean, one of the things I'm going to be watching really closely that kind of brings the earnings and the inflation stories together is last quarter, we heard so many companies-- Pepsi is one that stands out to me in particular-- where the volumes weren't very impressive, but they were managing to get those price increases through. So I think it's going to be really key this quarter to hear if that is still happening.JOSH SCHAFER: Can you still get the price increases through with inflation coming down? At what point does the consumer say, wait, inflation is coming down, I'm reading headlines that headline inflation is coming down, why am I still paying--- Well, it's a chicken and egg situation. Headline inflation is decelerating because they're not able to raise the prices in the last year. And then when you're a consumer and you see the news that inflation is starting to decelerate, then you say, wait, why am I still paying. And then it hopefully starts to--JOSH SCHAFER: And then if I'm a company, what does that do to my margins because am I still paying those inflationary prices and not being able to pass it on to the consumer? That's a big thing some of the analysts--- So that feeds into the magic word this earnings season, at least from the perspective of Peter Tchir who we had on earlier-- last earnings season, it was all about how many people could say artificial intelligence so many different ways, but how many different ways can companies say resiliency this earnings season. And that's going to be something that, at least from Peter Tchir who gave us that earlier today, could be the type of magical phrase or talking point or word that we hear this earnings season.- We'll see.- Yes, we will. Thank you so much for joining us, Allie Canal and Josh Schafer here this morning.]"
264,832d17ff-6ad7-4fe1-b827-7bc367321f28,UNH,2023-07-11,Did Nvidia ruin earnings season for stock market bulls?: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-nvidia-ruin-earnings-season-for-stock-market-bulls-morning-brief-130007544.html,1688994007,STORY,"['NVDA', 'BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'UNH']","[Pushing aside the letdown June jobs report and your general obsession (or is that just me) with everything coming out of the Federal Reserve, I want to remind you of three things to start the week.First, there is more to investing than stalking Federal Reserve headlines. Two, earnings season begins this week, and the stories companies tell investors will become more important than the Federal Reserve (at least until the July 26 FOMC meeting). And three, as the earnings machine kicks into overdrive, remember that not every company in the stock market is a profit beast with a five-year runway to show explosive growth like chip king Nvidia.And because of that brutal reality, the market could be set up for disappointment as crops of ho-hum earnings reports trickle in.""The bar has been set high for 2Q23 reporting season as blockbuster 5/24 results from Nvidia have catalyzed upward earnings revisions for the growth heavy Nasdaq,"" opined EvercoreISI's always prescient strategist Julian Emanuel in a weekend client note.To jog your memory, May 24 brought a shocker from Nvidia that opened a lot of eyes across Wall Street.Nvidia said it expects second quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion. I have been crunching numbers on stocks for 20 years — I have never seen this magnitude of sales upside from a company. Ever. Not even close.The Street is now projecting $11.02 billion in sales for Nvidia's second quarter, according to Yahoo Finance data. Analysts expect Nvidia to add another $1 billion in sales from the second quarter's end to the third quarter's conclusion (October).Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts at the time the very upbeat outlook reflected a fundamental shift to accelerated computing. In turn, that is placing Nvidia's chips that power generative AI in incredibly high demand.""We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,"" Huang said. ""You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs, and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.""Story continuesThe problem here is that UnitedHealth isn't selling AI chips. It sells healthcare. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway isn't selling AI chips. It sells railroad services via Burlington Northern (among other things). Home Depot for darn sure isn't selling AI chips. I just went to a Home Depot store on Sunday to buy a BBQ brush — no AI chips down aisle 10, I assure you.Yet, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied an impressive 6.5% since that Nvidia sales guidance shocker. The advance has bought the US equity market to a 19.3 times forward P/E multiple, a 19% premium to the 15-year average, points out strategists at UBS.It's as if investors are positioned for more Nvidia-type stories (a growth boom) instead of hearing ones where companies are being challenged by stubborn inflation, higher financing costs, and slowing sales growth.The mismatch in expectations — in part fueled by the juggernaut that is Nvidia — could trigger swift earnings-related sell-offs as reality comes home to roost, warns Emanuel.""Double misses"" (EPS and sales) are likely to be as punished or more vs. 1Q’s announcement reaction of -5.3%, while double beats could see anemic action,"" Emanuel says.He adds, ""Nvidia changed the way investors will perceive this upcoming earnings season.""Good if you own Nvidia, but probably bad if you don't.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal break down the calendar.Video Transcript- We've got a big week ahead of us-- important data, the start of second quarter earnings season, a lot to consider. Joining us now to cover all of it, Yahoo Finance reporters Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal. Josh, let's start with you. Give us the calendar here. What's on the docket?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, we got a more full calendar this week, guys. I'm excited about the calendar this week. Some weeks, we come in and we're not fired up about the calendar. We're fired up about this calendar because it's the start of earnings season.Right now, we're looking at the economic calendar right there. You can see you have the Fed Beige Book on Wednesday, CPI also on Wednesday, and then of course, consumer sentiment, the first reading of that University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment for July, expected on Friday. But I'm really fired up for earnings season to start too. We have bank earnings on Friday, and then you also have Delta reporting on Thursday, and Pepsi also expected to report on Thursday.But I think a key theme when you think about this week is really what have the interest rate hikes started to do to the economy. And when you think about what have they started to do to the financial system, how are they dealing with those high interest rates, and then how are they impacting inflation and CPI. Allie, I know that's something you've been following closely. Looks like those headline numbers are sort of expected to fall pretty heavily in that report on Wednesday.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, inflation expected to slow down, but it will still remain significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That along with the strong jobs report that we got on Friday, which showed unemployment low, wages high suggests that there will be more rate hikes to come. So here are the expected CPI numbers according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesWe see headline inflation expected to have risen 3.1% on a year over year basis in June. That is a slowdown from May's 4% rise with monthly inflation expected to tick up to 0.3%. Then if we take a look at core inflation, that strips out the more volatile pricing of food and gas. That's expected to have a yearly rise of 5%. Yet another slowdown compared to May with monthly core prices hitting 0.3%.According to a new note from Citi, the slowdown is expected to come from two things-- the deceleration of shelter pricing, which has long been expected, along with a decline in used car prices. That has remained stubbornly high. But we're expected to see that come down in this print and continue to come down through the back half of 2023 and into 2024. But again, guys, this is not enough to convince the Fed to pull back on those rate hikes.All the analyst notes that I've been reading pretty much expect on that Fed meeting on July 26 that they will raise rates by another 25 basis points. Markets are pricing this in as well. Data from CME group has about a 93% chance of that. And there is some expectation that we could see more rate hikes through November. But that's all going to depend on the data.The Fed has consistently said it's data dependent. CPI is a critical part of that data set. So we shall see.- By the way, we said nothing of note-- WD-40 reports after the close today. I'll be curious to see how they do. I'm not even kidding.JOSH SCHAFER: Good consumer brand.- Good consumer brand. I mean, one of the things I'm going to be watching really closely that kind of brings the earnings and the inflation stories together is last quarter, we heard so many companies-- Pepsi is one that stands out to me in particular-- where the volumes weren't very impressive, but they were managing to get those price increases through. So I think it's going to be really key this quarter to hear if that is still happening.JOSH SCHAFER: Can you still get the price increases through with inflation coming down? At what point does the consumer say, wait, inflation is coming down, I'm reading headlines that headline inflation is coming down, why am I still paying--- Well, it's a chicken and egg situation. Headline inflation is decelerating because they're not able to raise the prices in the last year. And then when you're a consumer and you see the news that inflation is starting to decelerate, then you say, wait, why am I still paying. And then it hopefully starts to--JOSH SCHAFER: And then if I'm a company, what does that do to my margins because am I still paying those inflationary prices and not being able to pass it on to the consumer? That's a big thing some of the analysts--- So that feeds into the magic word this earnings season, at least from the perspective of Peter Tchir who we had on earlier-- last earnings season, it was all about how many people could say artificial intelligence so many different ways, but how many different ways can companies say resiliency this earnings season. And that's going to be something that, at least from Peter Tchir who gave us that earlier today, could be the type of magical phrase or talking point or word that we hear this earnings season.- We'll see.- Yes, we will. Thank you so much for joining us, Allie Canal and Josh Schafer here this morning.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Union Pacific has reached a sick leave agreement with the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART-TD), the union group that represents train conductors.The tentative agreement, which would affect around 5,900 employees, provides up to eight paid sick leave days, UP (NYSE: UNP) said Sunday. The agreement consists of five additional paid sick days annually that would be prorated for 2023, and then the potential to convert up to three paid leave days as paid sick time in 2023, UP said.If SMART-TD members ratify this contract, UP will have sick leave agreements for all 13 of its labor unions. UP would be the second U.S.-based Class I railroad to do so, following Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC).“I want to thank SMART-TD leadership for their support as we work together to create an environment where employees feel valued, supported and empowered to deliver exceptional service to our customers,” UP President and CEO Lance Fritz said in a release. “We are committed to continued collaboration with our labor partners and employees to further identify opportunities that support our best-in-class workforce.”SMART-TD members have already ratified two sick leave agreements, one with NS and the other involving some members working for CSX (NASDAQ: CSX).  Some union members also received additional sick leave with BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B).Meanwhile, discussions on scheduled rest between UP and SMART-TD are ongoing, UP said Sunday. UP described scheduled rest as allowing employees to have more predictable schedules while enabling the railroad to better manage staffing levels. In May, UP reached a deal on scheduling with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, another union whose members tend to have schedules in flux.In response to the deal with UP, SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson said in a Monday release: “Our members made it very clear in 2022 that quality-of-life issues and the ability to provide stability for their families in times of medical crisis was of the utmost importance. On-demand sick days that do not amount to discipline from their employer are a historic step in the right direction for these men and women, and I am very proud of the effort that our General Chairmen on the UP properties put in to make this happen.”Story continuesSubscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inboxClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Norfolk Southern reaches sick leave agreements with 100% of craft workforceUnion members at CSX, CN ratify labor agreements2 craft unions press senators to act on rail safety billRail unions urge Biden to keep current STB chair at helmThe post Union Pacific and SMART-TD hash out sick leave deal appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The tentative deal aims to provide up to eight paid sick leave days to approximately 5,900 railroad employees. This deal reflects Union Pacific's commitment to creating a supportive work environment where employees feel valued and empowered to deliver exceptional service to customers.While all Union Pacific employees already receive some form of paid leave, the proposed agreement will grant SMART-TD members an additional five paid sick days annually, pro-rated for 2023. Furthermore, from 2024, these employees will have the option to convert up to three paid leave days for use as paid sick time. If ratified by SMART-TD, this agreement will make Union Pacific the second railroad operator to have paid sick leave agreements in place with all 13 of its labor unions. Earlier in the year, Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC became the first major North American freight railroad to provide paid sick time to all its workers.Lance Fritz, chairman, president, and CEO of Union Pacific, expressed gratitude to the SMART-TD leadership for their support in creating an environment that values employees and enables them to deliver exceptional service. He emphasized the company's commitment to ongoing collaboration with labor partners and employees to identify further opportunities that support their best-in-class workforce.In addition to the paid sick leave agreement, Union Pacific and SMART-TD are looking forward to continuing discussions on scheduled rest, aiming to provide employees with more predictable schedules and enabling the railroad company to better manage staffing levels. These discussions highlight the companies' focus on improving work-life balance for their employees.The agreement between Union Pacific and SMART-TD underscores the growing emphasis on employee well-being in the railroad industry. By providing additional paid sick leave, Union Pacific acknowledges the importance of supporting employees' health and personal well-being. The ability to convert paid leave days for sick time also offers flexibility, further enhancing work-life balance.Employee-friendly deals like this have a positive impact on the railroad industry as a whole.

Called Genetic Insights, the new offering helps people understand their potential risk of developing certain inheritable health conditions, with advanced technology and end-to-end support that includes personalized health reports and access to genetic counseling.Using a saliva specimen, Genetic Insights analyzes 36 genes to identify potential risk of nearly two dozen inheritable conditions, including breast and colon cancer; a number of heart and blood disorders; and carrier status for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Tay-Sachs disease. Designed to address gaps in existing consumer genetic tests, the new test is powered by advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology*, which can analyze thousands of DNA variants in genes associated with disease and looks at more regions in a person's genome than microarray testing technology.""Genetic Insights goes beyond the typical consumer genetic test. The Quest team spent the past couple of years innovating not just the test, but the entire consumer experience to deliver comprehensive, complex genetic health data in a way that is digestible and actionable to the end user,"" said Dr. Sarah South, PhD, FACMG, Executive Scientific Director of R&amp;D for Molecular Genetics and Oncology, Quest Diagnostics. ""The use of NGS is a crucial distinction­, because NGS-based tests are uniquely able to identify a wider range of genetic conditions and keep pace with new genetic discoveries.""Story continuesA uniquely guided user experienceIndividuals who purchase Genetic Insights at questhealth.com will receive an at-home saliva-collection kit and ship back their sample to Quest Diagnostics for analysis in one of the company's state-of-the-art laboratories. An independent physician orders the test for the individual, provides personalized information about the link between the genetic findings and the individual's health status, and is available to discuss the individual's questions. Test results will be available within three to five weeks.Each kit includes an activation code to unlock access to a personalized, secure interactive Genetic Insights online dashboard, where users can:Gain an overview of the Genetic Insights experience and access easy-to-understand educational materials on various conditions for which there could be risk;Provide relevant personal and family health history via a secure questionnaire, supporting results interpretation by the ordering physician;Track the status of each test kit, from sample collection to testing to results delivery;Chart family health history via an easy-to-use template that can be downloaded and shared with the individual's doctor;Access highly visual, personalized genetic health reports designed to break down complex genetic information into a digestible, actionable format. Reports include information on genes tested, test limitations, key takeaways, and suggested next steps based on DNA and family history;Schedule a one-on-one phone or video session with a third-party board-certified genetic counselor—available at no extra charge—to discuss results and what they mean, address any questions, and help map next steps.Supporting the continuity of careTo support a dialogue about inherited health risks and action steps, Genetic Insights also allows individuals to download and share clinical lab reports directly with their own doctors. Within the lab report, healthcare providers can access quick reference guides, which are intended to help facilitate discussions between providers and their patients and include key lab findings and clinical guideline-based resources and recommendations.""Half the physicians in the U.S. trust Quest for their laboratory tests, so we added unique features, like physician reference guides, to support dialogue and continuity of care between individuals who order Genetic Insights and their providers,"" Dr. South said. ""We also wanted to ensure access to genetic counseling and easy-to-understand educational content, so people have the end-to-end support to understand and act on their personal health risks.""Genetic Insights is now available for adults (ages 18+) in the United States** to purchase on questhealth.com for $199.For more information, visit questhealth.com and follow @testwithquest on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. *The Genetic Insights test is based on advanced NGS technologies that can detect 80-90 percent of inherited risk for specific health conditions1, including at least 80 percent of DNA variants linked to a higher risk of developing the most common form of inherited breast cancer. However, it is designed to be an elective screen and is not as sensitive as other NGS-based genetic test services that physicians may order in situations that require diagnostic-level sensitivity. Based on the results of this test and personal or family health history, an individual's physician may suggest additional genetic testing. The Genetics Insights test does not identify genetic risk markers of all known inheritable diseases.**Excludes AK, AZ, HI, and NYAbout Quest Quest empowers consumers by making affordable, high-quality, trusted healthcare easy.

DGX recently partnered with Proov, a manufacturer of at-home fertility and hormone tests, to offer the Proov Confirm PdG home collection kit for evaluating fertility available to women. The tests are aimed toward women who intend to start or grow a family through questhealth.com.The Proov Confirm PdG test is the first and only PdG (progesterone metabolite) home test kit to confirm successful ovulation that has been approved by the FDA.The latest move will expand Quest Diagnostics’ portfolio of testing services, fortifying the Diagnostic Solutions business.More on PdG TestThe PdG test is the first women's health test offered through questhealth.com that was manufactured by a different company. The Proov Confirm home collection kit can be purchased now on questhealth.com for $29. It involves a urine test, similar to an at-home pregnancy test, with results in 5-10 minutes.The PdG test is the first women's health test from a third-party manufacturer available through questhealth.com. In addition, users can also download the free Proov Insight app to receive reminders to test, gain help in interpreting results and personalize an action plan.Benefits of PdG TestA reproductive hormone called progesterone aids in preparing the uterine lining for implantation and pregnancy. The implantation window is the period after ovulation when progesterone levels should be raised to promote implantation. Pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), the main urine metabolite of progesterone, is designed to be detected by the Proov Confirm PdG test and can be used as a tool to help confirm ovulation. The ""implantation window"" is a four-day period where PdG levels in the urine are measured to determine whether ovulation was successful.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccording to the Centres for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, up to one in five women have fertility problems. It is recommended that women with ovulation problems consult with a healthcare professional about possible causes of the problem. For individuals who have tried unsuccessfully to get pregnant, the test might be appropriate. Women who have experienced previous infertility problems, PCOS, endometriosis, are 35 years of age or older, or who are using fertility drugs may also find it helpful.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global Fertility Test Market size was valued at $462.23 million in 2020, and is projected to reach $842.96 million by 2028, registering a CAGR of 7.8%. Fertility test market growth is attributed to rise in the prevalence of diseases such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) as women with the condition of PCOS do not ovulate each month regularly due to the overproduction of estrogen by the ovaries.Recent DevelopmentsIn June 2023, Quest Diagnostics completed its previously-announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. The acquisition is intended to improve patient outcomes through early, accurate detection of residual or recurring cancer. By combining its strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing with Haystack's liquid biopsy technology, DGX will likely dominate the rapidly-expanding MRD sector.The same month, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Coriell Life Sciences to provide select medical plan members with pharmacogenomics testing services. The test indicates how different genes and their variants affect an individual’s reaction to drugs. The pharmacogenomics test is a voluntary, no cost DNA-testing programme that uses a saliva collection kit that can be used at home to analyze a person's DNA. The effectiveness of the patient's existing drugs is evaluated in light of the test results.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 3.8% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 7%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.
