Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase State Street's shares on or after the 31st of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of April.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.63 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.52 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, State Street has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current stock price of $71.65. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for State Street Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. State Street paid out a comfortable 33% of its profit last year.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see State Street earnings per share are up 8.0% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. State Street has delivered 10% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid State Street? State Street has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Overall, State Street looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.In light of that, while State Street has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for State Street that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The banking crisis that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank continues, leaving what look like bargains but could be yield traps.The easiest way to seek safety is to look at the dividend-paying bank stocks from banks that deposited $30 billion into First Republic (NYSE:FRC) on March 16. These are the “too big to fail” banks the government backed in 2008.In the current crisis Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) each deposited $5 billion at First Republic. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) each put in half that.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTwo other big national banks, State Street (NYSE:STT) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) also put in $1 billion each, but their dividend yields are low. Citigroup, with a yield of 4.55%, leads the way.These are the dividend-paying bank stocks offering the best combination of safety and yield for the average investor who wants to take advantage of the current crisis to build a nest egg for tomorrow.TFCTruist Financial$32.55USBUS Bancorp$34.97PNCPNC Financial$122.01CCitigroup$43.32Truist Financial (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist Financial (NYSE:TFC), the largest regional bank in the Southeast, was born from the 2019 merger of BB&amp;T Bancshares of Winston-Salem with SunTrust of Atlanta. The two decided the merged company would be based in Charlotte. (Full disclosure: I have my business bank account at Truist.)The bank had assets of $555 billion at the end of 2022, up 2.6% from a year earlier. The book value per share is $40.58, giving it a price-to-book of about .77 on March 20. At the start of March, the shares sold at almost $47. That means it’s down 23% on the month.Rebellion Research, which uses machine learning to rate securities, insists Truist is in great shape. Bad loans encumber only 16.56% of the equity, and they don’t intend to sell them. Citigroup raised its rating on Truist amid the crisis, calling any comparison with SVB “apples to oranges” because of the broad swath of industries its deposits support. The bank’s 18 analysts think Truist will report $1.17 of earnings this quarter, $4.89 per share for the year. That’s a forward price-earnings ratio of just 6.5.Story continuesUS Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comUS Bancorp (NYSE:USB) takes its name from a Portland bank founded in 1891. It has been based in Minneapolis since buying First Trust Bank in 1997. That bank traces its history back to 1864. USB had assets of $674 billion at the end of 2022, making it the fifth largest U.S. bank, behind only the four money center banks. It has a market cap of $59 billion and a price to book value of 1.148 as of March 17.Besides its consumer banking, commercial banking, and wealth management operations, USB is also the seventh largest credit card bank, behind Discover (NYSE:DFS) and ahead of Wells Fargo.While its franchise is regional, with branches in the Midwest and western U.S., its banking footprint is national. Near the end of last year it acquired MUFG Union Bank, increasing its franchise on the West Coast.Baird upgraded USB as a “rare opportunity” in the current sell-off the same day Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) was taken over. Along with the dividend yield, it has a price-earnings ratio of just 10.5. Over $31 in cash backs each share of stock. On March 6 the shares were trading at $47. That means it’s off 27% since the start of the crisis, with no news on outflows to justify it. One caveat is that “Big Short” investor Michael Burry worries that over half of USB’s deposits are uninsured, because they’re in accounts over the $250,000 FDIC limit for insurance. He thinks it is susceptible to a run. I think it is more important that USB is geographically diversified, with accounts in a wide range of industries.The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comPNC (NYSE:PNC), based in Pittsburgh, is the dominant bank of the mid-Atlantic, but does a lot of things beyond standard banking.It has offices in 25 states. Its biggest concentrations outside the Midwest are in Atlanta and the Atlantic coast of Florida.PNC does mergers for smaller companies, it handles loan syndications, and it’s the second largest servicer of loans for other banks. It’s also one handler of Small Business Association (SBA) loans and a major credit card bank. It was formed from the 1983 merger of Provident and Penn National, both of which used the initials PNC.PNC had assets of $557 billion at the end of 2022, making it the sixth largest U.S. bank. Almost all the loans are domestic. The market cap of $55 billion gives it a price-earnings ratio of under 14 and a fat dividend yield of 4.8%. Its price-to-book is currently 1.39.PNC was big enough to be approached on an SVB bailout but turned it down. Rebellion Research recently calculated it has just $4.4 billion in losses on $40 billion of booked loans, and that its balance sheet looks good.Analysts at Baird see a 50% upside in the bank’s stock. Tipranks also sees the stock beating the market this year. On March 15, a black day for bank stocks, PNC stock fell less than its peers.Citigroup (C)A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong. Citigroup layoffsSource: TungCheung / Shutterstock.comCitigroup (NYSE:C) is the only money center bank with a 4% dividend yield. It went through a reverse split of 1:10 after the 2008 financial crisis and the stock has never returned to its pre-crisis level.Citi is a huge credit card bank, besides being an international lender. (Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) moved its credit card business to Citi a few years ago.) It even has its own travel portal, run with Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG)The dividend compensates for a distinct lack of capital gains. Over the last two years, the stock has lost 37% of its value. Over one-third of its business is international, and it has just 661 domestic branches, lowest among the seven largest U.S. banks. The price-to-book ratio is just .42.Some analysts consider Citi a gift at the current price. Bank of America recently raised its price target on the bank and gave it a buy rating.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in COST.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Edwards Lifesciences share price has climbed 79% in five years, easily topping the market return of 45% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Edwards Lifesciences achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period.

Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) share price has soared 133% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! Also pleasing for shareholders was the 14% gain in the last three months.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Microchip Technology was able to grow its EPS at 41% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 33% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Microchip Technology's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Microchip Technology the TSR over the last 3 years was 143%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Microchip Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.7% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 13% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Microchip Technology is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude closed $3.55, or 5.1%, higher at $72.81.Brent gained 2.8% last week while WTI rebounded by 3.8% as jitters in the banking sector eased.Prices received a lift as Turkey stopped pumping crude from Kurdistan via a pipeline following an arbitration decision that confirmed Baghdad's consent was needed to ship the oil. The exports amount to about half a percent of global oil supply, or 450,000 barrels per day (bpd).Loss of oil supplies from Kurdistan could offset the impact of Russian production and supplies finding their way to market, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. It also could force production cuts in the Kurdistan region.""Now we have this new wrinkle here....

The plant is expected to be fully operational by 2026, it added.Aramco will supply up to 210,000 bpd of crude oil as feedstock for the plant.State-owned NORINCO Group, a Chinese military equipment maker, owns 51% of HAPCO while Aramco and Panjin Xincheng hold stakes of 30% and 19%, respectively.Separately, Aramco on Sunday signed a memorandum of understanding with the southern Chinese province of Guangdong to explore cooperation in sectors including energy, finance, research and innovations, according to a post on the provincial government's website.Guangdong, China's largest provincial economy, has drawn global firms like Exxon Mobil and BASF, each building large-scale petrochemical complexes producing high-value chemicals.Aramco has been ramping up its China presence. In another deal reached last year, Aramco agreed with Shandong Energy an initial pact to explore a potential crude supply agreement and chemical products offtake deal.Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco also broke ground on a $7 billion project to produce petrochemicals from crude oil at its South Korean affiliate S-Oil Corp's refining complex in the port city of Ulsan.($1 = 6.8778 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Florence Tan and Chen Aizhu; additional reporting by Andrew Hayley in Beijing, Aziz El Yaakoubi in Riyadh and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by Sonali Paul, Christian Schmollinger and Christina Fincher)]"
15,1d6c46e4-db90-396b-b982-5dcc01bd5d46,O,2023-03-27,Banking Crisis Has Triggered Capital Flight From Oil To Gold,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banking-crisis-triggered-capital-flight-230000009.html,1679871600,STORY,"['HO=F', 'SI=F', 'NG=F', 'GC=F', 'CL=F', 'SCBFF']","[The sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has sent shockwaves through the entire financial sector and marked the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Being the only publicly traded bank focused on Silicon Valley and startups for four decades, the swift collapse has particularly rattled the venture capital community and left climate tech startups in a crisis.But the energy markets have not been spared, with oil prices crashing to multi-year lows following the ensuing banking crisis. Oil prices crashed spectacularly, with WTI crude falling from $80.46 per barrel just 10 days prior to the $67 range, while Brent declined from $86.18 per barrel to the $73 range, levels they last touched in December 2021. Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered warned that the oil price crash had been exacerbated by hedging activity–specifically, due to gamma hedging effects, with banks selling oil to manage their side of options as prices fell through the strike prices of oil producers put options and volatility increases. The negative price effect has been exacerbated because the main cliff-face of producer puts currently occupies a narrow price range.And now the latest Commitment of Traders (CoT) report published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has revealed where that oil money flowed to.Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have combined the CoT data with the equivalent Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) data and found that there was heavy selling of crude oil and gasoline, combined with a rapid move by funds into precious metals four days after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank but six days before Brent hit a 14-month low of USD 70.12 per barrel.Indeed, silver and gold saw a net increase in long positions while all other classes of crude and crude products apart from heating oil and natural gas saw a net increase in short positions.Related: Will Brent Break Below $70 This Year?During that period, money-manager net selling across the four main Brent and WTIStory continuesContracts hit a staggering 128.1 million barrels (mb) in the week to 14 March. Meanwhile,StanChart’s crude oil positioning index fell 41.6 w/w to -67.0, the largest single-week decline in six years, while its gasoline positioning index fell by 36.4 to -6.6, marking the first time it had turned negative in 20 months.Not surprisingly, gold prices have jumped nearly 9% since March 10, and now sit at $1,995/Oz, not far from the all-time high while silver prices have rocketed over 16% to trade at $23.35/Oz.Source: Standard Chartered ResearchBanking Fears LingerPreviously, StanChart analysts had said that the unwinding of speculative length appears to be complete at this juncture, thus lowering selling pressure, but had warned that prices might retest the lows if the FOMC hikes its policy rate by more than the widely expected margin of 25bps. The markets have successfully scaled that wall of worry after the Fed’s hike on Wednesday came in-line with expectations. The Fed also indicated that the current rate hike cycle is nearing an end. StanChart expects last week’s gamma effects to reverse course with banks buying back positions thus reinforcing the short-term rebound. Beyond that, StanChart says oil prices will largely be dictated by OPEC’s and consuming countries’ strategic inventory policy shifts. The commodity experts are bullish that the path of least resistance for oil prices at this point is higher, not lower.Yet oil prices, after a brief rebound, continue to face significant selling pressure, with both WTI and Brent crude down 2.5% on Friday’s intraday session. Apparently, banking fears are far from over and this situation could linger for a while. The market appears to be reacting to some other unfolding banking drama whereby shares of Germany’s Deutsche Bank have plunged 11% on Friday after its credit default swaps started pushing higher. Credit swaps are used for insuring the bank's debt against the risk of default, and rising rates means the market thinks the risk of DB defaulting is rising. DB’s woes have put the European banking sector in reverse gear, taking down with them shares of Barclays, BNP Paribas, UBS and Societe Generale.“Underlying sentiment is still cautious and in this environment no one wants to go into the weekend risk-on,” Nordea chief analyst Jan von Gerich has told Reuters.This comes despite European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde reassuring EU leaders that the euro area banking sector was resilient due to strong liquidity positions, ample capital and post-2008 reforms. She also said the ECB toolkit was ready to provide liquidity to the financial system if the need arises.The bigger question here is whether the recent spate of bank failures and crises, including the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and liquidity crisis at banking giant Credit Suisse, can be written off as “idiosyncratic” events or mark the unfolding of another global financial crisis. Right now the markets remain jittery and don’t appear to know what to make of the entire saga.But as UBS Wealth chief investment officer Mark Haefele has said, the swift action by the FDIC to guarantee deposits and by the Fed to lend to banks that require funds will solve liquidity-related risks for U.S. banks and also for the U.S. branches of foreign banks.A week ago, we witnessed another rout for mid-cap regional banks stocks, before reports emerged that big banks would come to their aid. The SPDR® S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) has crashed more than 25% since the SVB snafu, but appears to have stabilized lately.That suggests that energy markets could also quickly recover after the dust settles.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Standard Chartered Blames Gamma Hedging For Overdue Oil SelloffOil Prices Near $75 As Russia Extends Output Cut Through JuneBank Turmoil Could Undermine The Effect Of Biden’s Clean Energy BillRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The bloc criticized Russia’s move.While oil prices recovered a measure of recent losses last week, they were still close to 15-month lows as markets feared that an economic slowdown will erode crude demand this year.Brent oil futures fell 0.2% to $74.44 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.1% to $69.16 a barrel by 22:05 ET (02:05 GMT). Both contracts rose between 2% and 4% last week.But oil prices are down over 13% so far this year, with a bulk of losses coming in March as the collapse of several U.S. and European banks ratcheted up concerns over an economic slowdown this year.ING analysts noted that speculators had cut long positions on oil sharply over the past two weeks, with overall positioning turning more neutral through March.“This leaves speculators with quite a bit of room to push the market higher. Although, obviously for that, we will need to see a change in sentiment and an easing in concern over recent developments in the banking sector.”Focus remained on Deutsche Bank (ETR:DBKGn), Germany’s biggest lender, as the next potential casualty of the banking crisis after credit default swaps, which are the cost of insuring the bank against a potential credit crunch, surged to near five year highs last week. This saw traders dump Deutsche’s shares en masse.Still, U.S. stock futures were somewhat positive on Monday, although analysts noted that this was more so on a lack of more negative news than any positive developments.A mild recovery in the dollar also kept crude markets under pressure, after some Fed officials suggested that the bank could still hike interest rates two more times. But the path of U.S. monetary policy remains uncertain, especially as regulators act to prevent more fallout in the banking sector.Story continuesFocus this week is also on business activity readings from China, which recovered substantially this year after the lifting of zero-COVID measures. But middling trade and industrial data saw markets reassess just how much China will boost oil demand this year.Related ArticlesOil prices move little amid banking sector uncertaintyGold prices dip from $2,000, banking crisis in focusEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

(NYSE:FE) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.39 per share on the 1st of June. Based on this payment, the dividend yield will be 4.0%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, the dividend made up 219% of earnings, and the company was generating negative free cash flows. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating any free cash flow would definitely be difficult to keep up.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 55%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.20 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.56. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.4% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.FirstEnergy's Dividend Might Lack GrowthGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. We are encouraged to see that FirstEnergy has grown earnings per share at 32% per year over the past five years. EPS has been growing well, but FirstEnergy has been paying out a massive proportion of its earnings, which can make the dividend tough to maintain.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about FirstEnergy's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While we generally think the level of distributions are a bit high, we wouldn't rule it out as becoming a good dividend payer in the future as its earnings are growing healthily. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Revenue growth has slowed after a half-decade of steady hiring and large acquisitions, and the San Francisco-based company has been buffeted by executive changes including resignations of heir-apparent Bret Taylor and Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield.Still, investors rejoiced earlier this month after the company trounced profit forecast estimates, doubled stock buyback plans and signaled it was putting its large acquisition strategy on ice. Shares have rallied 43% this year, among the largest jumps of companies in the S&amp;P 500. They were little changed in New York at $190.29.Read More: Salesforce Finds Profit Is New Magic Word for Activist InvestorsMonday’s announcement without public concessions to the activist, like a board seat, is a win for Salesforce against Elliott, which took a multibillion-dollar stake in the software maker in January. The activist firm had put forward a slate of board directors in the open nomination window for the annual shareholder meeting, which usually is scheduled around June, suggesting the possibility of a proxy fight. In other companies, Elliott has pushed for CEOs to step down.Story continuesElliott released a positive statement after Salesforce’s blockbuster earnings, though said more work remains. The investor had earlier suggested some of the changes that Salesforce eventually made, though others, including further board director changes and succession planning, weren’t accepted at the time of earnings earlier this month.Salesforce and Elliott “have committed to continue the productive working relationship they have developed together,” the two companies said in the statement Monday. The “handshake” agreement to withdraw nominees doesn’t stop Elliott from re-engaging publicly with the company in the future, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named discussing a private matter.“We feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to deliver so far,” Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said Friday in an interview about Salesforce’s new focus on profit, before adding “it’s not a job that’s done by any stretch.” He said the firm could see job cuts beyond the 8,000 already announced, and hasn’t yet received final recommendations from consultant Bain &amp; Co., with whom Salesforce is working to review the business.Beyond Elliott, Starboard Value, ValueAct, Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital, and Dan Loeb’s Third Point have invested in Salesforce. In January, Salesforce appointed three new independent directors, including ValueAct Chief Executive Officer Mason Morfit.

The Information reported yesterday that Musk now values the company, which he took private, at about $20 billion. That’s based on an email that he reportedly sent to employees late Friday offering them equity grants (possibly to stem an exodus of talent) that they’ll be able to sell during future liquidity events. The assessment isn't far from one made by Fidelity Investments, which Axios reported on earlier this month.Twitter has lost advertisers following changes to its content moderation policies under Musk, who’s described himself as a “free-speech absolutist.” The company relies heavily on advertising, though Musk has been trying boost subscription revenue. He’s slashed about 75% of the company’s staff since taking over.As for OpenAI—maker of A.I. chatbots ChatGPT and GPT-4—Musk cofounded it and helped get it started in 2015 with a donation of about $100 million. He has longed warned about the threat artificial intelligence potentially poses to humanity. OpenAI was started as a nonprofit focused on the safe and transparent development of A.I.Musk parted ways with OpenAI in 2018, presumably because Tesla’s own A.I. work created a conflict—though according to a Semafor report published on Friday, it was actually because Musk offered to run OpenAI and was rejected by CEO Sam Altman and other founders.Whatever Musk’s reasons, OpenAI soon underwent significant changes. In 2019, it switched from a nonprofit to a “capped-profit” model and received the first of several large investments from Microsoft, which helped it with the vast computing resources needed for A.I. tools like ChatGPT.OpenAI’s valuation has shot up dramatically. Earlier this year, the company was in discussions to sell existing shares in a tender offer that would value it at about $29 billion, up from about $14 billion in 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal.Story continuesMusk has expressed frustration over OpenAI’s trajectory, noting his donation and the company’s current valuation. On March 15, he tweeted: “I’m still confused as to how a non-profit to which I donated ~$100M somehow became a $30B market cap for-profit. If this is legal, why doesn’t everyone do it?”A month earlier, he tweeted: “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.”Altman responded to Musk’s criticism on Thursday during the On With Kara Swisher podcast, saying, “Most of that is not true, and I think Elon knows that. We’re not controlled by Microsoft. Microsoft doesn’t even have a board seat on us, we are an independent company.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.85bUS$2.38bUS$2.72bUS$3.08bUS$3.27bUS$3.41bUS$3.53bUS$3.65bUS$3.75bUS$3.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.33%Est @ 3.66%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$82bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$82b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$42bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$63b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$74.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sysco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.809. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SyscoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”18.

This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.6% in value last week. Still, the 8.6% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Schlumberger. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Schlumberger. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Schlumberger's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Schlumberger. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.0% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Schlumberger Limited. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$142m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Schlumberger better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Schlumberger   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

For more movies, head on over to 10 Best New Movies on Netflix. One huge development of the technology revolution has been the rise of Netflix. The American streaming firm, which originally started in the late 90s as a DVD delivery company, is one of the biggest players in the media industry now. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has almost thirteen thousand employees and a whopping 231 million paid members in almost two hundred countries, making it a beast in the media delivery industry.Over the years, Netflix has transformed itself from a firm that primarily hosted content from other producers to making its own movies, television shows, and documentaries. These are often known for their unique approach to production, and significant viewership despite having low production budgets. In fact, Netflix's first television series, House of Cards which was produced by an external studio for Netflix, has become one of the most famous television shows in human history. The television series, which ended in 2018, is one of the highest rated television shows on the popular online repository, the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) with a strong rating of 8.7. This score is determined after more than half a million IMDB users rated the television show, with the majority or close to 330,000 users giving the show a score of nine points or higher. House of Cards ranks at 110 in IMDB's list of most popular television shows ranked by the number of ratings.Taking a look at the market in which Netflix is playing in, it appears that the best might be ahead for the company. For instance, a research report from Precedence Research outlines that the global video streaming market was worth $375 billion in 2021. It adds that the industry will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.5% between 2021 and 2030 to sit at an estimated, and whopping, $1.7 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that the growth in the sales of smartphones as well as the rise in Internet usage will provide users with easily accessible content available instantaneously and in the palm of their hand. Precedence Research also shares data from the Motion Picture Association to outline that online video on demand (VoD) users grew to 1.1 billion during the coronavirus pandemic and will almost double to 2 billion by the end of this year.Story continuesZooming in on Netflix's latest financial performance, the firm's latest financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 provided a mixed bag of results. Starting from its revenue and earnings per share, Netflix posted $7.85 billion in revenue and 12 cents in earnings per share. This saw the firm meet analyst estimates for revenue but it missed the 75 cents that analysts were expecting. However, at the same time, Netflix's biggest victory came in the form of the number of subscribers that it added in Q4 2022, with the 7.66 million new additions vastly surpassing the analyst consensus estimates of 4.57 million. At the same time, its earnings per share miss were not due to any operational deficiencies in the firm's operations but came due to losses on Euro denominated debt.After its earnings report, Wall Street weighed in on the results, with the opinion being nothing else than optimistic. Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Piper Sandler, Jefferies, Evercore ISI, Wolfe Research, JPMorgan, Barclays, Baird, Benchmark, Credit Suisse, Cowen, Canaccord, and Guggenheim all raising Netflix's share price target. Starting from them in respective orders, the share price targets were raised from $300 to $350, $270 to $325, $385 to $400, $340 to 400, $366 to $417, $330 to $390, $275 to $325, $235 to $250, $225 to $250, $271 to $291, $405 to $440, $365 to $400, and $305 to $375. Currently, the average consensus share price target for the firm is $357, for a small upside over the current share price. Additionally, the average share price rating for Netflix's shares is Buy.The latest bit of news surrounding the firm is its announcement that it will reduce prices by 50% in small markets that represent roughly 6% of its subscribers. This decision won approval from Citi, who in March 2023 increased Netflix's share price target to $400 from $395, as the research firm believes that the decision has the potential to boost Netflix's revenues by 1% since these are linked by efforts by the firm to cut down on account password sharing. JPMorgan built on the firm's anti password sharing efforts in March 2023 as well, as it believes that there was a ""considerable pushback"" against these efforts in markets where it was implemented and these can potentially harm the firm's efforts to add new subscribers to its platform. However, the investment bank also believes that despite the pushback, Netflix will continue on these efforts. At the same time, Netflix has also introduced a new ad supported tier, and this is performing well, with data from Bloomberg showing that after its first month of rollout, the platform grew by 500%.Netflix's founder and former chief executive officer Mr. Reed Hastings who stepped down in January commented on its growth over the past decades and shared:Jessica, it feels like yesterday was our IPO. We were covered in red envelopes, we IPO-ed at about $1. Hopefully, some of you have held the stock, the full 21 years. And when I think of the evolution, the three of us and so many other incredible Netflix employees to go from DVD service to streaming leader in films and television and emerging player in games and now to have over 230 million members, it’s just €“ well, Jim Collins probably said it best. He calls it a good start. We’ve had a good start. But honestly, we dream of the whole world finding their favorite entertainment on Netflix and we shorthand that as entertaining the world. And the three of us have been working together for 15 years now trying to figure out how do we get through this issue, that issue, how do we grow.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top movies on Netflix in 2023.35 Best New Movies on NetflixPhoto by Alexander Shatov on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo start off our list, we first looked at all new Netflix movie releases this year.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most anticipated TV shows of 2023.TV shows have continued to persist for decades in an industry which has been consistently changing for several years. Half a century ago, there weren't many options in the way of entertainment, with internet distractions not available, and only a few options available in terms of TV shows on television due to a lack of channels. This is why most of the most watched TV shows of all time are TV shows which were created in the 1970s and 1980s, with M*A*S*H's finale being the most watched TV show episode of all time with more than 105 million viewers tuning in. The show was produced by CBS, which in turn is owned by Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). Most of the revenue earned by TV show producers comes from commercials aired during broadcast, and the M*A*S*H series finale saw CBS charge $450,000 for 30 second commercial blocks, an unheard amount for 1983 and even higher than the Super Bowl, which would be well over $1.38 million adjusted for inflation in 2023, something which even the most anticipated TV shows of 2023 will struggle to achieve.15 most anticipated TV shows of 2023As more and more TV shows are being produced, and other entertainment options exist as well, viewership isn't close to the levels it used to be. However, the industry has rapidly evolved to cater to this situation and has been given a new lease on life with the advent of streaming services. While Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was the pioneer of the streaming era, other businesses soon saw the potential and jumped in, be it Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Amazon Prime, HBO with HBO Max which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) or Disney+, by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). For a decade, streaming companies continued to grow exponentially, tacking on viewers by the millions which received a massive boost in 2020 after lockdowns during the pandemic resulted in a major boost in the number of people looking to stream their television entertainment and ""binge watch"" rather than the traditional method of an episode a week. In fact, in 2020, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained a record 37 million subscribers while Disney+ crossed 100 million subscribers in just 16 months. However, in 2022, after Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced that its number of subscribers dropped which tanked its stock, taking down other streaming stocks as well, with just Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+ saw more than $300 billion in market value wiped off. High competition because of numerous strong competitors has also impacted growth rates for each streaming service, and what happens to the TV show industry will depend on the outlook of streaming companies.Story continuesAccording to Ampere Analysis, over $23 billion is expected to be spent on original content, some of which include the most anticipated TV shows of 2023. However, many countries are facing a cost of living crisis, including one of the biggest streaming markets in the United Kingdom, where the number of people with at least one paid-for video subscription fell by almost a million from just January to September 2022.To determine the most anticipated TV shows in 2023, we have checked multiple sources including Rolling Stones, Collider and The Wrap. If a show appeared first in a list of 35 shows, we assigned it a score of 35/35 =1, and 34/35 for second-place and so on. For lists appearing in multiple sources, we calculated the average score. The list was then ranked from the highest score to the lowest score, representing the average position of each TV show. We have excluded some TV shows such as The Last of Us, which has already come out in its entirety, was present on most lists and earned critical and commercial acclaim almost unanimously. So, let's take a look at the TV shows that you shouldn't miss out on, starting with:15.

There are just 3 episodes of the TV show which currently has a rating of 7.2/10 on IMDB.6. Daisy Jones and the SixTotal score: 0.85Fans of hippie culture or bands like Fleetwood Mac will absolutely love Daisy Jones and the Six, the Amazon Prime TV show which aired on March 3.

46,8d730466-7846-3d95-92c9-8e7f711d3ef6,AMGN,2023-03-27,Amgen bid to revive cholesterol drug patents comes to U.S. Supreme Court,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-bid-revive-cholesterol-drug-100000738.html,1679911200,STORY,"['AMGN', 'REGN', 'SAN.PA', 'SNY']","[By John Kruzel and Andrew ChungWASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear a bid by Amgen Inc to revive patents on its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha in a legal effort that rival Sanofi SA called a ""blatant attempt"" to squeeze competitors out of the market.Amgen is appealing a lower court's ruling that invalidated two of its patents on Repatha, a drug that can reduce risk of heart attack and stroke in people with heart disease, after a legal fight with French drugmaker Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen has sought to patent a group of antibodies that help reduce so-called ""bad"" cholesterol. At issue is whether a valid patent can cover all the members of an identified group, or if it is limited to only those members of the group specified by the patent owner.In 2014, Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron for patent infringement over their rival drug Praluent, which works by a similar mechanism as Repatha. Both drugs use laboratory-made antibodies to block a protein called PCSK9 that inhibits the removal of bad cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve this result through different chemical combinations.Bad cholesterol, known LDL, can cause a buildup of plaque in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.Amgen sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of Repatha worldwide in 2022. Regeneron sold $130 million worth of Praluent in the United States last year, and Sanofi sold more than $400 million worth in the rest of the world.The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals nationwide, invalidated Amgen's patents that covered PCSK9-blocking drugs as a group. The Federal Circuit in 2021 ruled that Amgen's patents granted by the government lacked the kind of detailed guidelines needed to replicate the full scope of its claims without ""undue experimentation.""Story continuesUnder U.S. law, a drug patent must allow a skilled scientist to replicate an invention without excessive trial and error.Amgen told the justices the Federal Circuit wrongly applied too high a legal bar by demanding that a patent explain how to make virtually every possible version of the invention that could perform the claimed functions. It argued that a patent need only to ""enable skilled artisans to 'make and use' the invention,"" not account for the full range of possible forms the invention might take.Sanofi urged the justices to affirm the Federal Circuit's ruling, characterizing Amgen's bid as ""a blatant attempt to corner the market.""""Amgen asserted these broad, functionally defined genus claims to literally try to take Praluent off the market and away from patients,"" lawyers for Sanofi wrote in a brief.Genus claims refer to patents that cover not just one specific thing but a group of related things.President Joe Biden's administration is supporting Sanofi in the dispute.A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June.(Reporting by John Kruzel and Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

48,8c966868-b3b5-376f-b2d6-ef6acb6411c2,NEM,2023-03-27,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for Capital Preservation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-buy-184027585.html,1679596827,STORY,"['ALB', 'CVX', 'AAPL', 'PFE', 'AZN', 'NEM', 'LMT']","[The financial sector-driven panic sent investors to the refuge of safe assets, including blue-chip stocks. In general, blue-chip stocks have a low beta and this supports capital preservation. Additionally, most blue-chip stocks have an attractive dividend yield. So, today, my focus is on names that are undervalued. Even if there is a meaningful correction in the broad markets, these blue-chip stocks are likely to remain resilient. Once market sentiments reverse, these stocks can deliver healthy total returns. Let’s discuss seven blue-chip stocks to buy at current levels.NEMNewmont Corporation$48.42LMTLockheed Martin$467.81ALBAlbemarle$216.72CVXChevron$154.51AAPLApple$158.81PFEPfizer$40.20AZNAstraZeneca$67.16Newmont Corporation (NEM)Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockGold has been trending higher and currently trades near $2,000 an ounce. Given the macroeconomic scenario and challenges in the financial system, I am bullish on the precious metal. Exposure to gold mining stocks is a good way to benefit from the rally. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a top name to consider with the stock trading at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.3. NEM stock also offers a dividend yield of 3.4%. Considering the rally is gold, I expect healthy dividend growth.There are several other reasons to like Newmont. The company has an investment-grade balance sheet. Further, the company has 96 million ounces of gold reserves that ensure steady production will into the 2040s. It’s also worth noting that the company expects a reduction in all-in-sustaining-cost in the next few years. Even if gold remains sideways, there is visibility for EBITDA margin expansion. At current valuations, the downside for NEM stock is capped and the upside potential is significant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLockheed Martin (LMT)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockEven in challenging market conditions, Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) stock has trended higher by 11% in the last six months. The 2.53% dividend yield stock has a low beta and is worth considering at current levels.Story continuesAn important point to note is that the defense sector is relatively immune to economic shocks. Global defense spending increased even during the pandemic. With several friction points globally on the geopolitical front, defense spending is likely to remain robust.Specific to Lockheed, the company reported an order backlog of $150 billion as of Q4 2022. On a year-on-year basis, the backlog increased by 11%. This provides the company with clear cash flow visibility. For the current year, the company has guided for a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. The company continues to invest in new defense technology like hypersonics. That’s a potential catalyst for growth besides higher order intake from NATO allies.Albemarle (ALB)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockAlbemarle’s (NYSE:ALB) stock has been rock solid in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.4, the stock is massively undervalued. Besides capital preservation, ALB stock has the potential to deliver healthy returns. Albemarle has been on a high-growth trajectory as the company aggressively expands its lithium conversion capacity. For the current year, the company has guided sales growth in the range of 55% to 75%.Further, the company expects operating cash flow in excess of $2 billion. With strong cash flow visibility, I expect dividend growth to be healthy. Albemarle also expects to continue expanding its lithium conversion capacity through 2027. The expansion is likely to be funded with internal cash flows. Considering the point that the lithium shortage will aggravate, the outlook for the company is bright for the coming years. As price realization increases, free cash flows will swell.Chevron (CVX)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockIt’s worth noting that crude oil has declined significantly in the recent past on fears of recession. However, Chevron’s (NYSE:CVX) stock has remained sideways in the last six months. This is an indication of the point that the stock is an attractive value. CVX stock also offers a dividend yield of 3.87%.A key reason to like Chevron is its strong balance sheet. As of Q4 2022, Chevron reported a net-debt ratio of 3.3%. Last year, Chevron reported an operating cash flow of $47.5 billion. With low break-even assets, cash flows will remain robust. This allows Chevron to make big investments and sustain dividends. Just to put things into perspective, Chevron plans to invest $13 to $15 billion annually in the next few years.In the last 10 years, the company reported an average reserve replacement ratio of 99%. With strong investments, RRR is likely to remain healthy. Importantly, there is clear cash flow visibility with a strong proven, and probable reserve base.Apple (AAPL)Source: ShutterstockAmidst difficult times for the technology sector, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has remained largely sideways in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.4, the stock is attractive. AAPL stock has a relatively low dividend yield of 0.58%. However, it’s among the top dividend growth stocks to consider.For Q1 2023, Apple reported revenue de-growth of 5% on a year-on-year basis. This was likely in a challenging economic environment. The long-term outlook remains positive as Apple continues to invest in product development. It’s worth noting that Apple generated $34 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter. This implies an annualized OCF potential of $130 to $140 billion.Given the cash flows, value creation will continue through dividends and share repurchases. It’s also worth mentioning that for Q1 2023, Apple reported record revenue of $20.8 billion from the services segment. I also remain bullish on the growth outlook for wearables.Pfizer (PFE)Source: ShutterstockPfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) stock is another name among low-beta blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. PFE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.8 and offers a dividend yield of 4.1%. Pfizer is attractive when it comes to a deep pipeline of products. As of January, the company had 110 drug candidates in the pipeline. With significant investments in research and development, the pipeline will ensure steady growth.The biopharmaceutical company has also been active on the acquisition front. Recently, the company signed an agreement to acquire Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) for a consideration of $43 billion. The latter is expected to contribute more than $10 billion to risk-adjusted revenue by 2030. Pfizer has a target of $25 billion in risk-adjusted revenue through acquisitions by 2030. It’s therefore likely that the company will continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions to broaden its product portfolio.AstraZeneca (AZN)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAstraZeneca’s (NASDAQ:AZN) stock has been trending higher with returns of 18% in the last six months. The stock however remains undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.0. AZN stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.96%.For 2022, AstraZeneca reported 25% and 33% growth in revenue and earnings per share respectively. For the current year, the company has guided for high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth. Therefore, considering the growth momentum, the stock is undervalued.A deep pipeline of drugs is another reason to be bullish. For 2023, the company will be initiating more than 30 drug trials for the third phase. Last year, AstraZeneca invested $9.5 billion in research and development. High R&amp;D investments will ensure healthy EPS growth well beyond 2023. I also like the fact that AstraZeneca is well-diversified geographically. For 2022, the company derived 26% of its revenue from emerging markets. A strong presence in these markets is a catalyst for long-term growth.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Joining us today are The Metals Company, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gerard Barron; and Chief Financial Officer, Craig Shesky.

Gerard, please go ahead.Story continuesGerard Barron: Thank you, Craig and good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2022 corporate update call. You are welcome to follow along with our slide deck or if you are joining us by phone, you can access it at any time at investors.metals.co. The fourth quarter saw some incredible and historic milestones for TMC, NORI, and our strategic partner and shareholder, Allseas. The single biggest milestone, of course, was the first integrated collection and lift of polymetallic nodules in the CCZ since the 1970s, in which 4,500 tons of nodules were collected and over 3,000 tons were lifted to the surface. But it wasn't just about collecting nodules. The test and the monitoring campaign running in parallel also collected over 200 terabytes of environmental data and that data will help us better understand absolute impacts of nodule collection, while lifecycle analysis can help us better understand relative impacts.On that front, the full benchmark lifecycle analysis previewed on our last call, but now released in full after third-party review shows that the NORI-D project model performed better in almost every impact category analyzed than all land-based throughout chosen for comparison. But we are not alone in the quest to provide the environmental and social guidepost for the responsible use of seafloor resources. And we were very pleased to announce in February that we joined a group of roughly 25 participants to develop an ESG handbook for marine minerals, the first of its kind in this area. And then earlier this month, we announced that Bechtel, a global leader in engineering, procurement and construction will collect and compile the technoeconomic studies being done by various consultants which are required for NORI to lodge its application for an exploitation contract with the ISA.And even in its early stages, we have already seen this partnership open many doors for us given the instant credibility that comes with the Bechtel name. Also this month, we announced a non-binding MOU with Pacific Metals Company, or PAMCO in Japan, to evaluate the tolling of 1.3 million tons of wet polymetallic nodules per year at PAMCO's Hachinohe smelting facility starting in 2025. This is another example of capital-light approach to get into production as it takes advantage of an existing facility with minimal required CapEx. And we will dive deeper on this a bit later on. And finally, I am pleased to announce some further developments on the financing front. Our partner and shareholder, Allseas, has made available to us the $25 million unsecured credit facility maturing in May 2024.The interest rate if drawn today would be just under 8% and there is a 4% per annum fee on undrawn amounts. We have been clear about our intentions to explore asset-level financing options and minimize dilution to shareholders. But as we continue those longer term financing discussions, it's extremely helpful to have this additional tool for shorter term liquidity. We also announced a strategic partnership with low carbon royalties in which we contributed a 2% gross overriding royalty on NORI in exchange for $5 million and a 35% equity stake in LCR, and importantly, a right to repurchase up to 75% of the royalty at a fixed IRR return. And in the coming years, LCR has the potential to be an important additional source of capital to bring NORI-D and other TMC projects into production, given their talented management team's track record of valuation creation and accretive deal-making.Finally, you may have seen the news in December that we put in place a $30 million ATM program to potentially issue shares opportunistically in the open market with the help of our bankers at Stifel and Wedbush. This tool provides us flexibility and optionality but make no mistake it is not our intention to use this as a primary financing tool. And when we report our Q1 results in May, you could expect that the drawn amount then will be the same as it is today, zero. So on the agenda, we are going to take you through the following items on the call, an overview of the recent headlines in the market, a regulatory update, an update on the NORI-D project, a recap of our near-term milestones and our financial update. So anyone scanning the press on the topic of deep sea nodules would have noticed a large pickup in coverage recently from the likes of the New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters, had a very worthwhile piece from Steven LeVine in The Electric just this week, which I'd recommend.It's hard sometimes to cut through all of the noise and the vocal and well-funded minority is likely to get louder as the ISA progress continues. But amidst this noise, there have been some strong signals and real action taken by credible companies and countries. Belgium's contractor, GSR, announced investment from leading offshore contractor Transocean, who will also provide GSR with the Samsung 10,000 drillship Olympia for conversion into a nodule production vessel ahead of its system integration test currently scheduled for 2025. And Norway recently announced a major discovery of critical minerals on the seabed of its continental shelf as it considers permitting offshore exploration within its EEZ. In December 2022, Japan announced plans to possibly begin extracting rare earth elements from the mud on the Western Pacific's deep sea bottom as early as 2024, budgeting $44 million for trial extraction equipment.There were also some attention grabbing headlines regarding China's action on deep sea nodules. In February, China's COMRA signed an extension of their CCZ contract, then exploration contract. And just this month, China's state owned newspaper recognized TMC's leadership position in the industry and announced its intention to invest further into the development of technologies to recover polymetallic nodules. But while the Chinese and Russian funded production dominates the nickel picture on land, that's not the case for seafloor nodules, herein lies the opportunity for nations and companies worried about supply chain security for battery metals. Collectively, our NORI and TOML projects rival today's largest producers both in Russia and Indonesia.And NORI and TOML were ranked earlier this year by Mining.com as the world's largest undeveloped nickel projects, larger than other projects in the pipeline in Canada and the U.S. and about an order of magnitude higher in grade. And speaking of grade, this chart plots the nickel equivalent grade on the Y-axis and nickel equivalent resource size on the X-axis comparing some of the more prevalent nickel projects for which data is available. And focusing on the bubbles in gray, some nickel projects have high grade and some have a large resource, but very few have both. TMC is an absolute outlier amongst peers with the largest nickel equivalent resource and the highest nickel equivalent grade. The scale of our resource can also be measured in terms of how big of a gap it can fill in the clean energy transition with each little car on this page, representing the metal required to electrify 1 million vehicles with a 75-kilowatt battery on an NMC 811 chemistry.Our NORI and TOML areas contain in situ qualities of nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese equivalent to the requirements of about 280 million vehicles or roughly the entire U.S. passenger fleet. And to deliver on energy transition goals, countries like the U.S. need to tap unconventional resources like nodules that can truly move the needle for nickel-rich battery chemistries. Shifting gears, as some of you may have read, UN member states reached a landmark agreement this month focused on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversities of area beyond national jurisdiction or BBNJ, as we know it. The High Seas Treaty, as it is known, took roughly two decades of negotiation and we applaud the commitment of member states to protect 30% of our ocean by the end of the decade.But I would remind our listeners that the International Seabed Authority has already exceeded this target with 43% of the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, home to 90% of all nodule exploration activity set aside for protection, far more than is under exploration. There has been some confusion as to the implications of the new treaty for deep-sea mining. The short answer is that the treaty neither impacts the mandate of the ISA as regulator nor the rights and responsibilities of sponsoring states and contractors. As we speak, the ISA session is in progress in Kingston, Jamaica, with the focus on the financial regime, regulations and standards and guidelines working hard to stick to the roadmap that has been laid out on this page.We are encouraged by much of what we are hearing from our team on the ground regarding the progress in this ongoing session and we will have a lot more to report after the session concludes on our next quarterly update call in May. Earlier this month, we announced that Bechtel will collect and compile the technoeconomic studies currently being compiled by various consultants, which are required for NORI to lodge its application for an exploitation contract with the ISA. And with their extensive experience working on historic infrastructure and mining projects, it's incredibly exciting to have a partner of Bechtel's caliber onboard to help NORI deliver a first-of-its-kind exploitation contract application to the ISA and ultimately bring this important resource of energy transition metals online in a responsible way.Metals, Industry, SteelPhoto by Francisco Fernandes on UnsplashSo with the help of another of our industry leading partners, Hatch, we developed a new zero-waste flow sheet that uses almost all of the nodules masked while producing zero tailings. And the products on the right side of the page are what you get after the refining process. And while we have developed the flow sheet as well, we may or may not take that extra step given that some future customers may prefer to take the alloy or map directly. Our pilot processing trials wrapped up in Q4 2021 showing definitively that we can turn that flow sheet into a reality. And over the last year, we have been searching for the right partner to help us from pilot stage to commercial stage production. We previously announced that we were exploring the possibility of building a new nodule processing facility in India with the help of Epsilon Carbon.And we still might find a way to work together in the future, but another opportunity presented itself last year, a turnkey option to potentially process our modules in an RKEF facility, which already exists. Earlier this month, we announced that we had signed a non-binding MOU with PAMCO of Japan to evaluate the tolling of 1.3 million tons or more of polymetallic nodules per annum at the Japanese smelting facility starting in 2025. PAMCO will undertake the studies to estimate the cost of processing nodules using their existing facilities and to identify any additional equipment requirements, which are currently expected to be minimal. In fact, the 22-ton sample of the nodules collected in last year's test has already been offloaded at their facility for testing.PAMCO have been smelting nickel laterite ore at their facility since 1965 and its plant seems well suited to deploy our new zero solid waste flow sheet, particularly because these nodules behave very similarly to nickel laterites in the smelting process. And working with PAMCO can help us achieve our stated capital-light strategy to get into initial commercial production, potentially reducing both our time to market and our upfront costs. As a reminder, NORI-D is the first project we are developing. It represents about 22% of our total estimated resource. And so far, we have invested over a decade of network . This slide lays out some of the key attributes of the NORI-D project, which gives a sense of how much progress has been made and why it's of increasing interest among strategic partners.As I mentioned, we were pleased to report in the fourth quarter that Allseas and NORI achieved all significant pilot collection system milestones while collecting approximately 4,500 tons of seafloor polymetallic nodules and over 3,000 tons were lifted up to 4.3 kilometer long riser to the Hidden Gem vessel. The pilot system achieved a sustained production rate of 86.4 tons per hour and gave us valuable operational data to inform future system optimizations and upgrades. And the Project Zero system will be targeting an average production rate of over 200 tons per hour following some modification. I'd like to play a short video where you can hear from the TMC and Allseas team onboard the vessel, just a few of the team members among the hundreds who made this historic achievement of reality.And for anyone on the audio call only, this will take about 3 minutes.Gerard Barron: There was also an environmental impact monitoring campaign that monitored every part of the collected test you just saw as part of our $100 million NORI-D ESIA program. We're working with some of the world's leading marine research institutions to amass one of the most comprehensive data sets ever compiled of the deep sea, some of which are highlighted on this page. During the collected test, scores of independent scientists and marine experts monitored the operations from a dedicated research vessel. The initial data generated during the two monitoring campaigns formed part of a broader data set gathered during the 16 offshore environmental baseline and resource definition campaigns conducted by TMC since 2012 as part of its environmental and social impact assessment for the NORI-D project.Our team is preparing to submit the first batch of this data to the ISA, and we expect that it is likely the most extensive deep-sea data set of its kind on the planet. As mentioned earlier, the ISA is well ahead of the curve when it comes to marine protected areas, as you can see in box one. In addition to these, various mitigation strategies are available to us. The process of upgrading the pilot collection system we had in the water last year to a full-scale commercial system is already underway. And the expert engineers at Allseas are leveraging the data and learnings from our offshore trials to optimize designs to further reduce our impacts, including plume and noise generation. We're pioneering a precautionary approach to development of this project and simultaneously undertaking a rigorous process of stakeholder engagement and public consultation.The data gathered from our offshore campaigns has and will continue to advance society's understanding of the deep sea in the CCZ and the potential impacts of our operations in this region. And this data is also central to the development of safe operating parameters being developed in partnership with CSIRO and NIWA on the adaptive management system, or AMS, as we know it. The first iteration of the AMS performed beautifully during the integrated collected test. And the teams are busy iterating and improving the system, which will serve as the virtualized in years of our operations. Of course, what often gets missed in the media reporting on the environmental impacts is that there is simply a lot less life to begin with in this part of the ocean.We're talking about 1,500x less biomass per square meter when compared to the biodiverse rainforest under which most future nickel supplier would otherwise come from in Indonesia. And as we've been saying for years, these nodules come with no social displacement, no deforestation, no digging, no blasting, no drilling, no child or forced labor, and importantly, no tailings. So rather than just talk about it, we took action and engaged a blue-chip metals research firm, Benchmark, to undertake a life cycle assessment of the environmental impacts of the NORI-D project, and how they compared to producing the same metals from conventional land ores using typical processing routes. This life cycle analysis, which has now undergone third-party review as well is linked in our press release this week.It's 227 pages long, and there is also a shorter form version. But let me summarize. The results are staggering. Across every single impact category measured, the nickel products derived from nodules outperformed every land-based source in this analysis, including carbon and waste impacts. We didn't even need to measure tailings impact because we will produce zero tailings. A similar life cycle analysis was also done on our future copper and cobalt supply. Again, nodules came out on top for both metal products other than two categories within cobalt in which we took second place. Zooming in on one metric, the graph shows the global warming potential per kilogram of nickel in nickel sulfate with the NORI-D project having the lowest footprint of all assessed alternatives, lowering emissions by between 70% to 80% on average, including with 70% lower global warming potential.And of course, the beauty of assessing our projects impacts before it even begins, is that we can work diligently to improve its environmental profile well in advance of commencing commercial operations. This study is part of the growing course of information based on science and real-world field data, which support the case for nodules as a key enabler of the clean energy transition. And I'd now like to turn it over to Craig to discuss project economics, valuation and our financial results.Craig Shesky: Thank you, Gerard. So starting place is always for valuation is our NPV. And in March 2021, AMC Consultants issued an SEC Regulation S-K 1300 compliant initial assessment of the project economics for the NORI-D area. The NORI initial assessment is available on the Investors section of our website and on NORI-D financial model can be found beginning on Page 310 of that PDF document. But for modeling purposes, we've also now added the excel tables from this initial assessment as a separate document. Just look for the Excel icon as you scroll down. And that initial assessment, which was a point-in-time analysis, arrived at a net present value of $6.8 billion for NORI-D at the beginning of 2021. But if you run that same model simply by updating it for current metal prices, the net present value of NORI-D would be approximately $13 billion, again on just 22% of our total estimated resource.Looking back on 2022, we haven't had all of them, though we've completed most of our stated milestones, particularly those on the project development side. We do have more work to do to sign some definitive agreements on Project Zero, and we've talked about some of the new partnerships on that front. And we're happy with where the discussions are headed. We've also been very pleased to share the results of the benchmark LCA study with potential off-takers. Now the next page lays out some of the critical milestones that we think can and should lead to step changes in our public valuation. These next critical milestones include, of course, continued progress from the ISA working as we speak on the final exploitation regulations, NORI submitting an exploitation application for the NORI-D area, the ISA then granting an exploitation contract over the NORI-D area.And then finally, the beginning of commercial production shortly thereafter. So when you look at us in the public markets and wonder why it is we're still trading around 1%, 1.5% of net present value, we think progress on those milestones will get us training to where we should relative to public comparables, 20%, 30%, 40% of net present value at this stage of production. And now on to financial results. In the last quarter of 2022, TMC reported a net loss of $109.6 million, $0.41 per share compared to TMC's net loss of $19.8 million or $0.09 per share for the same period in 2021. The net loss for the last quarter of 2022 included exploration and evaluation expenses of $104.3 million versus $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. G&amp;A expenses of $7 million versus $15.4 million in Q4 2021, partially offset by a gain of $1.3 million due to a decrease in the value of our warrants.There is a big difference, of course, between the fourth quarter of 22 and 21, and let's explain that. The increase in exploration expenses was mainly a result of a recording of $69.9 million for the Allseas warrant, and that was recorded at the March 2021 deep green share value date, and that was $7 per share, again at that point in March 2021. So that, along with $8.7 million related to the 10.85 million shares issued to Allseas as completion payment following the successful conclusion of the pilot collection system trial, those are really the big movers within that number. And we've laid out on the slides available on our website and on this webcast, exactly how you can analyze and normalize those numbers and potentially back out.General and administrative expenses decreased in the last quarter of 2022 compared to the last quarter of 2021, reflecting a reduction in share-based compensation and a reduction in communication and advertising costs, partially offset by higher personnel, legal and other expenses associated with being a public company. In the last quarter of 2022, the net cash used in operating activities amounted to $19.8 million compared to $27.8 million for the last quarter of 2021. Excluding non-recurring items, free cash flow for the last quarter of 2022 was negative $20 million compared to negative $27.8 million in the last quarter of 2021. And again, keep in mind, these are quarters in which we had offshore campaigns, many hundred people at fee. This is not necessarily a run rate or useful for projections going forward.And in fact, as we said previously, we  or a team of less than 40 people and can run a very tight shift if need be. And regarding our balance sheet as at December 31, 2022, we closed the quarter with a cash balance of $46.8 million. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Gerard for some closing remarks before our Q&amp;A.Gerard Barron: Thank you, Craig. After the achievements we reported in November, we really focused on adding names to the ecosystem working hard on the first of this kind project. We've succeeded in adding more credibility to this project with the help of brand names like Benchmark, PAMCO, Bechtel, all of the participants in the ESG handbook for Marine Minerals and of course, the continued unwavering support of Allseas. Our focus for the next quarter and the rest of 2023 is to continue building partnerships, some of which can help on the financing front and craft the best possible exploitation application contract. I know our team is up to the challenge. And speaking of our team, many of whom I know will be listing, I'd like to extend an enormous thank you for their dedication and enormous efforts to this important mission. So thank you for your interest and attention. And with that, we'd like to turn it back to the operator for any Q&amp;A.See also 18 Most Selling Phone Brands in the World and 16 Largest Pest Control Companies in USA.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Africa’s Thungela Seeks More Coal Assets as Rail Woes Worsen,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/africa-thungela-seeks-more-coal-104654980.html,1679914014,STORY,['M'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Thungela Resources Ltd. is seeking to buy more overseas assets, as rail bottlenecks hobble shipments by South Africa’s largest exporter of thermal coal.Most Read from BloombergSaudi National Bank Chair Resigns After Credit Suisse RemarkBinance and Its CEO Sued by CFTC Over US Regulatory ViolationsFirst Citizens to Buy SVB After Biggest Failure Since 2008Schwab’s $7 Trillion Empire Built on Low Rates Is Showing CracksThungela — spun off from Anglo American Plc two years ago — posted record profit last year as European demand for coal surged following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the miner’s shares fell as much as 12% in London trading on Monday, after the company said it expects sales to drop for a second year as South Africa’s state-owned rail operator Transnet SOC Ltd. faces increasing problems on its main coal export line.Thungela Chief Executive Officer July Ndlovu said the Johannesburg-based producer will consider purchasing both thermal and metallurgical coal assets amid worsening logistical challenges at home. Under a deal announced last month, Thungela and its co-investors agreed to acquire 85% of the Ensham mine from Idemitsu Australia Ltd. for A$340 million ($226 million).“We said we wanted to diversify for good reason and therefore will continue to look outside South Africa to future-proof our business,” Ndlovu said in an interview. “If we do get Ensham over the line, it contributes toward that cash generation potential which will allow us to look at all these opportunities.”The CEO declined to say whether Thungela has found more assets to buy after agreeing to the Ensham deal.Thungela’s coal shipments fell 10% to about 13 million tons last year, even as higher prices buoyed the miner’s revenue and profit. Those sales are expected to fall further as Transnet grapples with a shortage of locomotive spare parts and vandalism on the line that runs from coal fields in Mpumalanga to Richards Bay Coal Terminal on the east coast.Story continuesRead: Anglo Coal Spinoff to Buy Controlling Stake in Australian MineThe miner’s profit more than doubled to about 18 billion rand ($990 million), boosted by record coal prices. Thungela said it will pay a total dividend of 13.8 billion rand, as it sees coal prices remaining strong despite softening this year.The company said it could ship between 10.5 million to 12.5 million tons this year, which would be the lowest on record, Ndlovu said. Thungela has 3.2 million tons of stockpiled coal at its mines and another 400,000 tons at the port. The uncertainty regarding Transnet’s performance means Thungela couldn’t provide guidance for 2024, it said.Thungela slumped 11% as of 11:42 a.m. in London.

52,7f19e0ba-9798-3adb-bc3d-12e010d737ce,M,2023-03-27,Russian Oil Flows Hold Fast Even as Kremlin Says Output Slashed,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-oil-flows-hold-fast-101022806.html,1679911822,STORY,['M'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s seaborne crude flows are holding strong, meaning a pledge by the Kremlin to cut the nation's production sharply has yet to feed through into supplies to the international marketplace.Most Read from BloombergSaudi National Bank Chair Resigns After Credit Suisse RemarkBinance and Its CEO Sued by CFTC Over US Regulatory ViolationsFirst Citizens to Buy SVB After Biggest Failure Since 2008Stocks Rise as Banks Sigh in Relief; Bonds Retreat: Markets WrapThe nation’s shipments slid by 123,000 barrels a day to 3.11 million barrels a day in the seven days to March 24, according to tanker tracking by Bloomberg. The less-volatile four-week average dipped by a similar amount. It’s the sixth straight week they've held above 3 million a day.Russia pledged to lower output by 500,000 barrels a day from this month through June in response to a Group of Seven price cap on the nation's crude sales. The planned cut has yet to show up in cargo data. Since the reduction was announced oil prices have fallen sharply, suggesting little trader anxiety about the threatened curtailment.Any production drop will initially be offset by reduced demand from the nation’s refineries during a period of seasonal maintenance. Lost pipeline flows to Europe are also adding to the volumes available for export by sea.The output reduction will be made from a baseline level of around 10 million barrels a day, Novak said. But the actual reduction may be smaller, with January and February output rates both assessed below that level by the International Energy Agency. With Brent crude currently trading near $75 a barrel and market forecasts showing a surplus in the first half of the year, Russia’s OPEC+ partners may welcome a unilateral output cut from the group’s second-largest producer.The increase in seaborne flows seen at the start of the year, which is most apparent in the four-week average data, probably reflects the diversion of crude previously delivered to Poland and Germany through the Druzhba pipeline. Flows to Germany halted at the end of 2022 and deliveries to Poland dropped to about 60,000 barrels a day under the country’s last remaining supply contract with a Russian company.The loss of those pipeline markets means an additional 500,000 barrels a day of Russian crude is now being exported through the country’s ports, despite the European Union ban on imports of almost all of Moscow’s crude and refined fuels and a G7 price cap that together prompted Moscow’s threat to cut output.Story continuesThe combined volume of crude on vessels heading to China and India plus smaller flows to Turkey and quantities on ships that haven’t yet shown a final destination slipped back in the latest four-week period, to an average 3.1 million barrels a day, dropping to their lowest in six weeks.As the ultimate destinations of cargoes loading in late January became apparent, flows to China rose to new post-invasion highs, though those levels haven’t been maintained with February-loading cargoes. Historical patterns suggest that most of the vessels currently identified as “Unknown Asia” destinations and heading for the Suez Canal will end up in India.Ship-to-ship transfers of cargoes in the Mediterranean continue apace. This has been most visible off the Spanish north African city of Ceuta and off the Greek coast near Kalamata. At least 55 cargoes have been transferred between ships in those two locations since the start of the year. The volume transferred off the coast of Greece, mostly in the Bay of Lakonikos, soared in February, rising to more than 10 million barrels, equivalent to 360,000 barrels a day. That compares with 4.4 million barrels, equivalent to 156,000 barrels a day transferred off Ceuta.A tanker carrying a cargo of Russian crude remains anchored off the Ghanaian port of Tema more than a month after it arrived at the west African country. The National Petroleum Authority granted a delivery period for the cargo to be unloaded, but national security considerations have held up the process, according to people familiar with the matter.Crude Flows by DestinationCrude flows in the week to March 24 slipped by 123,000 barrels a day from the previous week. On a four-week average basis, overall seaborne exports dropped by the same amount to 3.32 million barrels a day.All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. Those are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through the Baltic ports of Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk.The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies. Transit crude is specifically exempted from European Union sanctions.AsiaMost Read from BloombergSaudi National Bank Chair Resigns After Credit Suisse RemarkBinance and Its CEO Sued by CFTC Over US Regulatory ViolationsFirst Citizens to Buy SVB After Biggest Failure Since 2008Stocks Rise as Banks Sigh in Relief; Bonds Retreat: Markets WrapFour-week average shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, plus those on vessels showing no final destination, fell below 3 million barrels a day for the first time in five weeks. Shipments dropped to 2.99 million barrels a day in the period to March 24, compared with 3.18 million barrels a day previously.While the volumes heading to China and India appear to have declined, history shows that most of the cargoes on ships without an initial destination eventually end up in one or other of those countries.The equivalent of 467,000 barrels a day was on vessels showing destinations as either Port Said or Suez in Egypt, or which already have been or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India or China and show up in the chart below as “Unknown Asia” until a final destination becomes apparent.The “Other Unknown” volumes, running at 426,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to March 24, are those on tankers showing a destination of Ceuta, Kalamata or no destination at all. Most of those cargoes go on to transit the Suez Canal, but some could end up in Turkey. An increasing number are being transferred from one vessel to another in the Mediterranean for onward journeys to Asia.EuropeMost Read from BloombergSaudi National Bank Chair Resigns After Credit Suisse RemarkBinance and Its CEO Sued by CFTC Over US Regulatory ViolationsFirst Citizens to Buy SVB After Biggest Failure Since 2008Stocks Rise as Banks Sigh in Relief; Bonds Retreat: Markets WrapRussia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries remained at a low of 63,000 barrels a day in the 28 days to March 24, with Bulgaria the sole destination. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey.A market that consumed more than 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve.No Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to March 24.Exports to Turkey, Russia’s only remaining Mediterranean customer, recovered most of the previous week’s loss, rising to an average of 136,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to March 24. Flows there are less than one-fifth of the high they reached in September.Despite not being a part of European sanctions on Russian crude exports, Turkey’s role as a lifeline for Moscow since the EU import ban came into effect on Dec. 5 has dwindled. The Star refinery near Aliaga, owned by Azerbaijan’s Socar, is cutting down purchases of Russian crude, with flows to the plant averaging about 50,000 barrels a day in January and February, compared with about 180,000 barrels a day from August to October. Just two cargoes of Russian crude have been delivered to the Star refinery so far in March, with two more heading to the port of Aliaga, where the refinery is located alongside another belonging to Turkey’s Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS, known as Tupras. Those cargoes could go to either plant.Flows to Bulgaria, now Russia’s only Black Sea market for crude, remained at 63,000 barrels a day for a second week. Despite Bulgaria securing a partial exemption from the EU’s import ban, the use of Russian crude has fallen to one-third of what it was in October, with Lukoil PJSC switching back to using non-Russian crude in its refinery at Burgas. Flows of Russian crude to Bulgaria remain the lowest since April.Flows by Export LocationAggregate flows of Russian crude edged lower to 3.11 million barrels a day in the week to March 24. A slump in exports from the Pacific was only partly offset by higher shipments from the other three regions.Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.Export RevenueInflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty edged lower by $2 million to $42 million in the seven days to March 24, while four-week average income was unchanged at $43 million.President Vladimir Putin has signed into law amendments to the way Russia’s oil price is assessed for tax purposes. From April, rates of mineral extraction tax and profit-based tax on oil companies will be calculated using a decreasing discount to prevailing Brent prices, rather than assessments of Urals crude. Export duty, which will be phased out at the end of 2023, will not be affected by the change.The duty rate for March was set at $1.94 a barrel, the first increase since December, based on a Urals price of $50.51 a barrel during the assessment period that ran from Jan. 15 to Feb. 14. April will remain virtually unchanged, with export duty on crude set at $1.95 a barrel. That’s based on an average Urals price of $50.80 a barrel, more than $34 below the average Brent price during the assessment period of Feb. 15 to March 14.Origin-to-Location FlowsThe following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions.A total of 28 tankers loaded 21.8 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to March 24, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s down by 850,000 barrels, or 4%, from the previous week. Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.The total volume on ships loading Russian crude from Baltic terminals rebounded from the previous week’s drop to average 1.36 million barrels a day.Shipments from Novorossiysk in the Black Sea jumped to their highest since May, with flows hitting 750,000 barrels a day. Shipping crude from the Black Sea, rather than the Baltic, can cut the journey time to India by more than a week, as long as tankers don’t suffer long delays transiting the Turkish Straits that connect the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.Arctic shipments were unchanged, with two Suezmax tankers loading in the week to March 24.Flows from the Pacific slumped to their lowest in more than three months. Seven tankers loaded at the region’s three export terminals in the week to March 24, down from 13 the previous week. There was an apparent gap in activity at the Kozmino export terminal between Tuesday morning and Friday afternoon, which restricted departures from the port to just four vessels.India is continuing to take an significant volume of ESPO crude, accounting for six out of 24 cargoes loading so far this month, compared with two out of a total 30 shipments in February.The volumes heading to unknown destinations are all Sokol cargoes that have recently been transferred to other vessels at Yeosu, or are currently being shuttled to an area off the South Korean port from the loading terminal at De Kastri. Most of these are also ending up in India.Note: This story forms part of a regular weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government.Note: All figures exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga as KEBCO grade crude.Note: Data on crude flows can also be found at {DSET CRUDEJ }.

Woodside Energy Group Ltd., the country’s largest liquefied natural gas producer, fell 3.4%.An overhaul of the safeguard mechanism is seen as vital for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to achieve Australia’s upgraded 2030 target for emissions reductions. The policy is intended to mandate tougher climate action for the entities it covers, which together account for around a quarter of Australia’s total emissions.The revised plans announced Monday will offer at least A$1 billion ($665 million) for impacted industries that can support decarbonization efforts, including the steel and cement sectors. The funding won’t go toward any initiatives aimed at expanding the fossil fuel industry, the government said.Story continuesAfter negotiations with the Greens, there’ll be a limit on absolute emissions of 140 million tons a year, which will decrease over time. Energy Minister Chris Bowen will also need to carry out additional scrutiny of any project that threatens to breach that cap, potentially jeopardizing some fossil fuel developments, Bandt said.But Albanese denied the new legislation would kill off investment in projects required for Australia’s clean energy transition, including new gas production, pointing out he had refused to concede to Green Party demands that new coal and gas projects be banned under the legislation.An immediate ban on future gas projects would be “irresponsible,” Bowen said earlier this month, adding that the fuel will be necessary to complement a transition to the government’s target of 82% renewable generation by 2030.Albanese’s Labor government came to power in May last year with a vow to reverse the nation’s reputation as a climate laggard. While the administration has tightened national emissions targets, Labor has also faced criticism over its support for some coal and gas developments.“These reforms are crucial to our climate and our economy – supporting Australian industry and ensuring they will continue to be competitive in a decarbonizing world,” Bowen said in a Monday statement.The main opposition center-right coalition of the Liberals and Nationals in February said it would vote against the proposed legislation.(Updates with details from first paragraph, shares in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeSmart Ways to Repay Your Pandemic Small Business Disaster LoanWhat Happens When Sexting Chatbots Dump Their Human LoversHow to Keep Corporate Accounts Safe Amid Bank Collapse JittersIranian Activists Want Tech Companies to Ban the Ayatollah©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude closed $3.55, or 5.1%, higher at $72.81.Brent gained 2.8% last week while WTI rebounded by 3.8% as jitters in the banking sector eased.Prices received a lift as Turkey stopped pumping crude from Kurdistan via a pipeline following an arbitration decision that confirmed Baghdad's consent was needed to ship the oil. The exports amount to about half a percent of global oil supply, or 450,000 barrels per day (bpd).Loss of oil supplies from Kurdistan could offset the impact of Russian production and supplies finding their way to market, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. It also could force production cuts in the Kurdistan region.""Now we have this new wrinkle here.... It's production that we really can't afford to lose,"" Kilduff said, adding that the loss of supply would amplify any other future force majeure or production outages.First Citizens BancShares Inc said it will acquire deposits and loans of failed Silicon Valley Bank, closing one chapter in the crisis of confidence that has roiled financial markets.""Oil prices are edging higher extending gains from the previous week as investors weighed up efforts by the authorities to calm concerns regarding the global banking system,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.There are also hopes for extra support for bank funding after reports that U.S. authorities were in early deliberations about expanding emergency lending facilities.Wall Street equities gained as the banking deal offered a respite after weeks of turmoil.Story continuesOil prices also drew support from worries of geopolitical turmoil after Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, one of Russia's most pronounced nuclear signals yet.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said Moscow is close to achieving its target of cutting crude output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to about 9.5 million bpd.Still, Russia's crude exports are expected to remain steady as it cuts refinery output in April, data from industry sources and Reuters calculations showed on Friday.On the demand side, China's crude oil imports are expected to rise 6.2% in 2023 from last year's level to 540 million tonnes, according to an annual forecast by a research unit of China National Petroleum Corp on Monday.Investors were waiting for U.S. inventory data. U.S. crude oil stockpiles were seen rising about 200,000 barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.The American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, will publish its inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar, additional reporting by Noah Browning in London, Mohi Narayan in New Delhi and Florence Tan in SingaporeEditing by Jason Neely, David Goodman, Ken Ferris and David Gregorio)]"

The plant is expected to be fully operational by 2026, it added.Aramco will supply up to 210,000 bpd of crude oil as feedstock for the plant.State-owned NORINCO Group, a Chinese military equipment maker, owns 51% of HAPCO while Aramco and Panjin Xincheng hold stakes of 30% and 19%, respectively.Separately, Aramco on Sunday signed a memorandum of understanding with the southern Chinese province of Guangdong to explore cooperation in sectors including energy, finance, research and innovations, according to a post on the provincial government's website.Guangdong, China's largest provincial economy, has drawn global firms like Exxon Mobil and BASF, each building large-scale petrochemical complexes producing high-value chemicals.Aramco has been ramping up its China presence. In another deal reached last year, Aramco agreed with Shandong Energy an initial pact to explore a potential crude supply agreement and chemical products offtake deal.Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco also broke ground on a $7 billion project to produce petrochemicals from crude oil at its South Korean affiliate S-Oil Corp's refining complex in the port city of Ulsan.($1 = 6.8778 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Florence Tan and Chen Aizhu; additional reporting by Andrew Hayley in Beijing, Aziz El Yaakoubi in Riyadh and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by Sonali Paul, Christian Schmollinger and Christina Fincher)]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Comfort Systems USA FIX, Hershey HSY, Wynn Resorts WYNN, Insulet PODD and Lattice Semiconductor LSCC.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Fed Policy Pause &amp; Yellen’s Assurance Buoy Wall Street: 5 PicksU.S. stocks closed higher on Mar 23 despite a volatile trading session, with gains from mega-cap stocks like Apple and Microsoft helping the tech-heavy Nasdaq climb northward. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow too finished higher and regained some of the losses from Wednesday’s selloff.Investors were optimistic that the Federal Reserve will pause interest rate increases in the near term, which undoubtedly bodes well for economic growth. After all, interest rate hikes do impact consumer outlays and increase the cost of borrowing.The Fed did raise interest rates by 25 basis points recently in an attempt to curb stubbornly high inflation. But policymakers in their statement did get rid of the term “ongoing increases” in interest rates. Instead, they mentioned that the Fed “anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”Fed Chair Jerome Powell this time urged market pundits to focus more on words such as “some” and “may”, and not necessarily on “policy firming.”His advice did assure investors that the central bank is likely to press the pause button on interest rate hikes.The recent bank meltdown, by the way, is hurting broader stock market returns. Panics of a bank run compelled lenders to take less risk with their capital reserves to ensure they have sufficient cash to cover any slew of withdrawal requests. However, this could mean that banks will stop providing loans to business houses, and issue fewer mortgages leading to an economic cooldown and a slowdown in the housing market.Story continuesNotably, the Silicon Valley Bank collapsed due to bond-related losses linked with an increase in interest rates. Consequently, customers rushed to get money out of the bank, while the broader banking sector witnessed a similar withdrawal of funds after SVB’s breakdown.But U.S. treasury secretary Janet Yellen reassured investors yesterday that bank deposits in the United States were safe and that policymakers do have the wherewithal to tackle any bank-related crisis. She confirmed that the federal government has applied the necessary tools to prevent contagion and is willing to apply such tools if required again.Thus, Yellen’s effort to lessen investor fears about the banking-sector stability coupled with the Fed’s willingness to pause its interest rate hikes not only boosted the stock market now but will also help it to chug along in the near future. Given such positives, it's prudent for investors to place their bets on growth stocks.We have, therefore, highlighted five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), which is up 68%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 55% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 33%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.Wynn Resorts actually saw its revenue drop by 13% per year over three years. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned 19%, compound, over three years. If the company is cutting costs profitability could be on the horizon, but the revenue decline is a prima facie concern.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWynn Resorts is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 7% per year over five years. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future.

59,7e7ad7b8-6804-3e2e-96fe-61dbfb5b22b0,MAS,2023-03-27,16 Biggest Plumbing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-biggest-plumbing-companies-world-105957900.html,1679914797,STORY,"['SGO.PA', 'MSM', 'WSO-B', 'WTS', 'MAS', 'FAST', 'POOL', 'MLI', 'CRH']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 biggest plumbing companies in the world. For more plumbing companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Plumbing Companies in the World. Plumbing is one of the most important industries in the world. This is due to the simple fact that human health and living standards have massively improved as time has progressed, and at the heart of this improvement is sanitation and waste management since it is crucial to prevent the outbreak of diseases.At the same time, plumbing has also allowed humans to live in regions that were previously uninhabitable. The ability to use hot water is one of the most important inventions of modern day society since it enables populations living in harsh climates to maintain their hygiene. Therefore, the plumbing industry itself is worth billions of dollars. On this front, a research report from Global Industry Analysts estimates that the global plumbing fixtures and fittings market was worth $81.8 billion in 2020. From this, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% to sit at roughly $111 billion by the end of 2027. According to the research firm, within this market, the kitchen sink and fixtures market will outpace the broader market by growing at a 5.1% while the bathroom fixtures segment will follow the market by growing at 4.5%.Global Industry Analysts also estimate that China will grow faster than the market as well, with its plumbing and fixtures market growing at a 5.7% CAGR to sit at $30.2 billion by the end of 2027. As far as the U.S. is concerned, the country's plumbing market was worth $17.3 billion in 2020 to account for almost a quarter of the entire market.Speaking about the trends in the market, the plumbing industry is also being influenced by technology, especially due to its potential to contribute to climate change and the efficient utilization of the Earth's natural resources. However, before we get to that, the industry itself is facing several problems as we settle into 2023. The U.S. economy is currently witnessing a paradigm shift as the Federal Reserve grapples with both the painful reality of inflation and the consequences of its fight to contain it. The Fed's decision to rapidly increase interest rates has stressed the U.S. financial system, including the housing industry as people find it more difficult to get mortgages to buy more homes, and construction firms also find it harder to finance their working capital. Naturally, any impact on the housing market will also impact the plumbing sector, and the industry has been anticipated to experience slow job growth until 2030. However, at the same time, in what is perhaps a counterintuitive fact, the plumbing industry is still facing a labor shortage, with the National Association of Home Builders estimating that there was a 55% plumbing labor shortage in 2021.Story continuesWith that out of the way, now let's focus on the rising trend of smart housing. According to research from Grand View Market Research, the solar heater market was worth a mere $2 billion in 2016 but is expected to outpace the broader global plumbing fixture market by growing at a CAGR of 8.1% by 2025. The research firm attributes this growth to rising energy prices that end up increasing everyone's natural gas or electricity bill as well as a rising global population. Additionally, according to the same research firm, the global smart bathroom fixtures market is also expected to outpace the broader market, since it will exhibit a CAGR of 10.5% between 2020 and 2027 to sit at an estimated $6.7 billion by the end of the forecast period. Grand View Market Research attributes this growth to the novel features offered by products such as smart toilets which are self cleaning and have innovative devices like smart faucets which help users save water. The smart faucet segment is expected to grow at 10.9% by 2027. At the same time, the smart toilet segment formed the largest market share, as it commanded 33% of the broader market in 2019.Don't Miss: 20 Biggest Plumbing Supply Companies in the WorldFinally, the winds of sustainability have already started to blow in the industry itself, with the chief executive officer of Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation (NYSE:ZWS), a water flow systems products provider, Mr. Todd Adams, outlining in a recent earnings call:Our customers care about the sustainability of their buildings and retrofit products, that’s why we will soon complete our first product lifecycle analysis, the document, end-to-end environmental impact of our Elkay stainless steel sinks with plans to do more.

You are welcome to follow along with our slide deck or if you are joining us by phone, you can access it at any time at investors.metals.co. The fourth quarter saw some incredible and historic milestones for TMC, NORI, and our strategic partner and shareholder, Allseas. The single biggest milestone, of course, was the first integrated collection and lift of polymetallic nodules in the CCZ since the 1970s, in which 4,500 tons of nodules were collected and over 3,000 tons were lifted to the surface. But it wasn't just about collecting nodules. The test and the monitoring campaign running in parallel also collected over 200 terabytes of environmental data and that data will help us better understand absolute impacts of nodule collection, while lifecycle analysis can help us better understand relative impacts.On that front, the full benchmark lifecycle analysis previewed on our last call, but now released in full after third-party review shows that the NORI-D project model performed better in almost every impact category analyzed than all land-based throughout chosen for comparison. But we are not alone in the quest to provide the environmental and social guidepost for the responsible use of seafloor resources. And we were very pleased to announce in February that we joined a group of roughly 25 participants to develop an ESG handbook for marine minerals, the first of its kind in this area. And then earlier this month, we announced that Bechtel, a global leader in engineering, procurement and construction will collect and compile the technoeconomic studies being done by various consultants which are required for NORI to lodge its application for an exploitation contract with the ISA.And even in its early stages, we have already seen this partnership open many doors for us given the instant credibility that comes with the Bechtel name. Also this month, we announced a non-binding MOU with Pacific Metals Company, or PAMCO in Japan, to evaluate the tolling of 1.3 million tons of wet polymetallic nodules per year at PAMCO's Hachinohe smelting facility starting in 2025. This is another example of capital-light approach to get into production as it takes advantage of an existing facility with minimal required CapEx. And we will dive deeper on this a bit later on. And finally, I am pleased to announce some further developments on the financing front. Our partner and shareholder, Allseas, has made available to us the $25 million unsecured credit facility maturing in May 2024.The interest rate if drawn today would be just under 8% and there is a 4% per annum fee on undrawn amounts. We have been clear about our intentions to explore asset-level financing options and minimize dilution to shareholders. But as we continue those longer term financing discussions, it's extremely helpful to have this additional tool for shorter term liquidity. We also announced a strategic partnership with low carbon royalties in which we contributed a 2% gross overriding royalty on NORI in exchange for $5 million and a 35% equity stake in LCR, and importantly, a right to repurchase up to 75% of the royalty at a fixed IRR return. And in the coming years, LCR has the potential to be an important additional source of capital to bring NORI-D and other TMC projects into production, given their talented management team's track record of valuation creation and accretive deal-making.Finally, you may have seen the news in December that we put in place a $30 million ATM program to potentially issue shares opportunistically in the open market with the help of our bankers at Stifel and Wedbush. This tool provides us flexibility and optionality but make no mistake it is not our intention to use this as a primary financing tool. And when we report our Q1 results in May, you could expect that the drawn amount then will be the same as it is today, zero. So on the agenda, we are going to take you through the following items on the call, an overview of the recent headlines in the market, a regulatory update, an update on the NORI-D project, a recap of our near-term milestones and our financial update. So anyone scanning the press on the topic of deep sea nodules would have noticed a large pickup in coverage recently from the likes of the New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters, had a very worthwhile piece from Steven LeVine in The Electric just this week, which I'd recommend.It's hard sometimes to cut through all of the noise and the vocal and well-funded minority is likely to get louder as the ISA progress continues. But amidst this noise, there have been some strong signals and real action taken by credible companies and countries. Belgium's contractor, GSR, announced investment from leading offshore contractor Transocean, who will also provide GSR with the Samsung 10,000 drillship Olympia for conversion into a nodule production vessel ahead of its system integration test currently scheduled for 2025. And Norway recently announced a major discovery of critical minerals on the seabed of its continental shelf as it considers permitting offshore exploration within its EEZ. In December 2022, Japan announced plans to possibly begin extracting rare earth elements from the mud on the Western Pacific's deep sea bottom as early as 2024, budgeting $44 million for trial extraction equipment.There were also some attention grabbing headlines regarding China's action on deep sea nodules. In February, China's COMRA signed an extension of their CCZ contract, then exploration contract. And just this month, China's state owned newspaper recognized TMC's leadership position in the industry and announced its intention to invest further into the development of technologies to recover polymetallic nodules. But while the Chinese and Russian funded production dominates the nickel picture on land, that's not the case for seafloor nodules, herein lies the opportunity for nations and companies worried about supply chain security for battery metals. Collectively, our NORI and TOML projects rival today's largest producers both in Russia and Indonesia.And NORI and TOML were ranked earlier this year by Mining.com as the world's largest undeveloped nickel projects, larger than other projects in the pipeline in Canada and the U.S. and about an order of magnitude higher in grade. And speaking of grade, this chart plots the nickel equivalent grade on the Y-axis and nickel equivalent resource size on the X-axis comparing some of the more prevalent nickel projects for which data is available. And focusing on the bubbles in gray, some nickel projects have high grade and some have a large resource, but very few have both. TMC is an absolute outlier amongst peers with the largest nickel equivalent resource and the highest nickel equivalent grade. The scale of our resource can also be measured in terms of how big of a gap it can fill in the clean energy transition with each little car on this page, representing the metal required to electrify 1 million vehicles with a 75-kilowatt battery on an NMC 811 chemistry.Our NORI and TOML areas contain in situ qualities of nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese equivalent to the requirements of about 280 million vehicles or roughly the entire U.S. passenger fleet. And to deliver on energy transition goals, countries like the U.S. need to tap unconventional resources like nodules that can truly move the needle for nickel-rich battery chemistries. Shifting gears, as some of you may have read, UN member states reached a landmark agreement this month focused on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversities of area beyond national jurisdiction or BBNJ, as we know it. The High Seas Treaty, as it is known, took roughly two decades of negotiation and we applaud the commitment of member states to protect 30% of our ocean by the end of the decade.But I would remind our listeners that the International Seabed Authority has already exceeded this target with 43% of the Clarion Clipperton Zone of the Pacific Ocean, home to 90% of all nodule exploration activity set aside for protection, far more than is under exploration. There has been some confusion as to the implications of the new treaty for deep-sea mining. The short answer is that the treaty neither impacts the mandate of the ISA as regulator nor the rights and responsibilities of sponsoring states and contractors. As we speak, the ISA session is in progress in Kingston, Jamaica, with the focus on the financial regime, regulations and standards and guidelines working hard to stick to the roadmap that has been laid out on this page.We are encouraged by much of what we are hearing from our team on the ground regarding the progress in this ongoing session and we will have a lot more to report after the session concludes on our next quarterly update call in May. Earlier this month, we announced that Bechtel will collect and compile the technoeconomic studies currently being compiled by various consultants, which are required for NORI to lodge its application for an exploitation contract with the ISA. And with their extensive experience working on historic infrastructure and mining projects, it's incredibly exciting to have a partner of Bechtel's caliber onboard to help NORI deliver a first-of-its-kind exploitation contract application to the ISA and ultimately bring this important resource of energy transition metals online in a responsible way.Metals, Industry, SteelPhoto by Francisco Fernandes on UnsplashSo with the help of another of our industry leading partners, Hatch, we developed a new zero-waste flow sheet that uses almost all of the nodules masked while producing zero tailings. And the products on the right side of the page are what you get after the refining process. And while we have developed the flow sheet as well, we may or may not take that extra step given that some future customers may prefer to take the alloy or map directly. Our pilot processing trials wrapped up in Q4 2021 showing definitively that we can turn that flow sheet into a reality. And over the last year, we have been searching for the right partner to help us from pilot stage to commercial stage production. We previously announced that we were exploring the possibility of building a new nodule processing facility in India with the help of Epsilon Carbon.And we still might find a way to work together in the future, but another opportunity presented itself last year, a turnkey option to potentially process our modules in an RKEF facility, which already exists. Earlier this month, we announced that we had signed a non-binding MOU with PAMCO of Japan to evaluate the tolling of 1.3 million tons or more of polymetallic nodules per annum at the Japanese smelting facility starting in 2025. PAMCO will undertake the studies to estimate the cost of processing nodules using their existing facilities and to identify any additional equipment requirements, which are currently expected to be minimal. In fact, the 22-ton sample of the nodules collected in last year's test has already been offloaded at their facility for testing.PAMCO have been smelting nickel laterite ore at their facility since 1965 and its plant seems well suited to deploy our new zero solid waste flow sheet, particularly because these nodules behave very similarly to nickel laterites in the smelting process. And working with PAMCO can help us achieve our stated capital-light strategy to get into initial commercial production, potentially reducing both our time to market and our upfront costs. As a reminder, NORI-D is the first project we are developing. It represents about 22% of our total estimated resource. And so far, we have invested over a decade of network . This slide lays out some of the key attributes of the NORI-D project, which gives a sense of how much progress has been made and why it's of increasing interest among strategic partners.As I mentioned, we were pleased to report in the fourth quarter that Allseas and NORI achieved all significant pilot collection system milestones while collecting approximately 4,500 tons of seafloor polymetallic nodules and over 3,000 tons were lifted up to 4.3 kilometer long riser to the Hidden Gem vessel. The pilot system achieved a sustained production rate of 86.4 tons per hour and gave us valuable operational data to inform future system optimizations and upgrades. And the Project Zero system will be targeting an average production rate of over 200 tons per hour following some modification. I'd like to play a short video where you can hear from the TMC and Allseas team onboard the vessel, just a few of the team members among the hundreds who made this historic achievement of reality.And for anyone on the audio call only, this will take about 3 minutes.Gerard Barron: There was also an environmental impact monitoring campaign that monitored every part of the collected test you just saw as part of our $100 million NORI-D ESIA program. We're working with some of the world's leading marine research institutions to amass one of the most comprehensive data sets ever compiled of the deep sea, some of which are highlighted on this page. During the collected test, scores of independent scientists and marine experts monitored the operations from a dedicated research vessel. The initial data generated during the two monitoring campaigns formed part of a broader data set gathered during the 16 offshore environmental baseline and resource definition campaigns conducted by TMC since 2012 as part of its environmental and social impact assessment for the NORI-D project.Our team is preparing to submit the first batch of this data to the ISA, and we expect that it is likely the most extensive deep-sea data set of its kind on the planet. As mentioned earlier, the ISA is well ahead of the curve when it comes to marine protected areas, as you can see in box one. In addition to these, various mitigation strategies are available to us. The process of upgrading the pilot collection system we had in the water last year to a full-scale commercial system is already underway. And the expert engineers at Allseas are leveraging the data and learnings from our offshore trials to optimize designs to further reduce our impacts, including plume and noise generation. We're pioneering a precautionary approach to development of this project and simultaneously undertaking a rigorous process of stakeholder engagement and public consultation.The data gathered from our offshore campaigns has and will continue to advance society's understanding of the deep sea in the CCZ and the potential impacts of our operations in this region. And this data is also central to the development of safe operating parameters being developed in partnership with CSIRO and NIWA on the adaptive management system, or AMS, as we know it. The first iteration of the AMS performed beautifully during the integrated collected test. And the teams are busy iterating and improving the system, which will serve as the virtualized in years of our operations. Of course, what often gets missed in the media reporting on the environmental impacts is that there is simply a lot less life to begin with in this part of the ocean.We're talking about 1,500x less biomass per square meter when compared to the biodiverse rainforest under which most future nickel supplier would otherwise come from in Indonesia. And as we've been saying for years, these nodules come with no social displacement, no deforestation, no digging, no blasting, no drilling, no child or forced labor, and importantly, no tailings. So rather than just talk about it, we took action and engaged a blue-chip metals research firm, Benchmark, to undertake a life cycle assessment of the environmental impacts of the NORI-D project, and how they compared to producing the same metals from conventional land ores using typical processing routes. This life cycle analysis, which has now undergone third-party review as well is linked in our press release this week.It's 227 pages long, and there is also a shorter form version. But let me summarize. The results are staggering. Across every single impact category measured, the nickel products derived from nodules outperformed every land-based source in this analysis, including carbon and waste impacts. We didn't even need to measure tailings impact because we will produce zero tailings. A similar life cycle analysis was also done on our future copper and cobalt supply. Again, nodules came out on top for both metal products other than two categories within cobalt in which we took second place. Zooming in on one metric, the graph shows the global warming potential per kilogram of nickel in nickel sulfate with the NORI-D project having the lowest footprint of all assessed alternatives, lowering emissions by between 70% to 80% on average, including with 70% lower global warming potential.And of course, the beauty of assessing our projects impacts before it even begins, is that we can work diligently to improve its environmental profile well in advance of commencing commercial operations. This study is part of the growing course of information based on science and real-world field data, which support the case for nodules as a key enabler of the clean energy transition. And I'd now like to turn it over to Craig to discuss project economics, valuation and our financial results.Craig Shesky: Thank you, Gerard. So starting place is always for valuation is our NPV. And in March 2021, AMC Consultants issued an SEC Regulation S-K 1300 compliant initial assessment of the project economics for the NORI-D area. The NORI initial assessment is available on the Investors section of our website and on NORI-D financial model can be found beginning on Page 310 of that PDF document. But for modeling purposes, we've also now added the excel tables from this initial assessment as a separate document. Just look for the Excel icon as you scroll down. And that initial assessment, which was a point-in-time analysis, arrived at a net present value of $6.8 billion for NORI-D at the beginning of 2021. But if you run that same model simply by updating it for current metal prices, the net present value of NORI-D would be approximately $13 billion, again on just 22% of our total estimated resource.Looking back on 2022, we haven't had all of them, though we've completed most of our stated milestones, particularly those on the project development side. We do have more work to do to sign some definitive agreements on Project Zero, and we've talked about some of the new partnerships on that front. And we're happy with where the discussions are headed. We've also been very pleased to share the results of the benchmark LCA study with potential off-takers. Now the next page lays out some of the critical milestones that we think can and should lead to step changes in our public valuation. These next critical milestones include, of course, continued progress from the ISA working as we speak on the final exploitation regulations, NORI submitting an exploitation application for the NORI-D area, the ISA then granting an exploitation contract over the NORI-D area.And then finally, the beginning of commercial production shortly thereafter. So when you look at us in the public markets and wonder why it is we're still trading around 1%, 1.5% of net present value, we think progress on those milestones will get us training to where we should relative to public comparables, 20%, 30%, 40% of net present value at this stage of production. And now on to financial results. In the last quarter of 2022, TMC reported a net loss of $109.6 million, $0.41 per share compared to TMC's net loss of $19.8 million or $0.09 per share for the same period in 2021. The net loss for the last quarter of 2022 included exploration and evaluation expenses of $104.3 million versus $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. G&amp;A expenses of $7 million versus $15.4 million in Q4 2021, partially offset by a gain of $1.3 million due to a decrease in the value of our warrants.There is a big difference, of course, between the fourth quarter of 22 and 21, and let's explain that. The increase in exploration expenses was mainly a result of a recording of $69.9 million for the Allseas warrant, and that was recorded at the March 2021 deep green share value date, and that was $7 per share, again at that point in March 2021. So that, along with $8.7 million related to the 10.85 million shares issued to Allseas as completion payment following the successful conclusion of the pilot collection system trial, those are really the big movers within that number. And we've laid out on the slides available on our website and on this webcast, exactly how you can analyze and normalize those numbers and potentially back out.General and administrative expenses decreased in the last quarter of 2022 compared to the last quarter of 2021, reflecting a reduction in share-based compensation and a reduction in communication and advertising costs, partially offset by higher personnel, legal and other expenses associated with being a public company. In the last quarter of 2022, the net cash used in operating activities amounted to $19.8 million compared to $27.8 million for the last quarter of 2021. Excluding non-recurring items, free cash flow for the last quarter of 2022 was negative $20 million compared to negative $27.8 million in the last quarter of 2021. And again, keep in mind, these are quarters in which we had offshore campaigns, many hundred people at fee. This is not necessarily a run rate or useful for projections going forward.And in fact, as we said previously, we  or a team of less than 40 people and can run a very tight shift if need be. And regarding our balance sheet as at December 31, 2022, we closed the quarter with a cash balance of $46.8 million. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Gerard for some closing remarks before our Q&amp;A.Gerard Barron: Thank you, Craig. After the achievements we reported in November, we really focused on adding names to the ecosystem working hard on the first of this kind project. We've succeeded in adding more credibility to this project with the help of brand names like Benchmark, PAMCO, Bechtel, all of the participants in the ESG handbook for Marine Minerals and of course, the continued unwavering support of Allseas. Our focus for the next quarter and the rest of 2023 is to continue building partnerships, some of which can help on the financing front and craft the best possible exploitation application contract. I know our team is up to the challenge. And speaking of our team, many of whom I know will be listing, I'd like to extend an enormous thank you for their dedication and enormous efforts to this important mission.

West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude closed $3.55, or 5.1%, higher at $72.81.Brent gained 2.8% last week while WTI rebounded by 3.8% as jitters in the banking sector eased.Prices received a lift as Turkey stopped pumping crude from Kurdistan via a pipeline following an arbitration decision that confirmed Baghdad's consent was needed to ship the oil. The exports amount to about half a percent of global oil supply, or 450,000 barrels per day (bpd).Loss of oil supplies from Kurdistan could offset the impact of Russian production and supplies finding their way to market, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. It also could force production cuts in the Kurdistan region.""Now we have this new wrinkle here.... It's production that we really can't afford to lose,"" Kilduff said, adding that the loss of supply would amplify any other future force majeure or production outages.First Citizens BancShares Inc said it will acquire deposits and loans of failed Silicon Valley Bank, closing one chapter in the crisis of confidence that has roiled financial markets.""Oil prices are edging higher extending gains from the previous week as investors weighed up efforts by the authorities to calm concerns regarding the global banking system,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.There are also hopes for extra support for bank funding after reports that U.S. authorities were in early deliberations about expanding emergency lending facilities.Wall Street equities gained as the banking deal offered a respite after weeks of turmoil.Story continuesOil prices also drew support from worries of geopolitical turmoil after Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, one of Russia's most pronounced nuclear signals yet.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak has said Moscow is close to achieving its target of cutting crude output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to about 9.5 million bpd.Still, Russia's crude exports are expected to remain steady as it cuts refinery output in April, data from industry sources and Reuters calculations showed on Friday.On the demand side, China's crude oil imports are expected to rise 6.2% in 2023 from last year's level to 540 million tonnes, according to an annual forecast by a research unit of China National Petroleum Corp on Monday.Investors were waiting for U.S. inventory data. U.S. crude oil stockpiles were seen rising about 200,000 barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.The American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, will publish its inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar, additional reporting by Noah Browning in London, Mohi Narayan in New Delhi and Florence Tan in SingaporeEditing by Jason Neely, David Goodman, Ken Ferris and David Gregorio)]"

The plant is expected to be fully operational by 2026, it added.Aramco will supply up to 210,000 bpd of crude oil as feedstock for the plant.State-owned NORINCO Group, a Chinese military equipment maker, owns 51% of HAPCO while Aramco and Panjin Xincheng hold stakes of 30% and 19%, respectively.Separately, Aramco on Sunday signed a memorandum of understanding with the southern Chinese province of Guangdong to explore cooperation in sectors including energy, finance, research and innovations, according to a post on the provincial government's website.Guangdong, China's largest provincial economy, has drawn global firms like Exxon Mobil and BASF, each building large-scale petrochemical complexes producing high-value chemicals.Aramco has been ramping up its China presence. In another deal reached last year, Aramco agreed with Shandong Energy an initial pact to explore a potential crude supply agreement and chemical products offtake deal.Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco also broke ground on a $7 billion project to produce petrochemicals from crude oil at its South Korean affiliate S-Oil Corp's refining complex in the port city of Ulsan.($1 = 6.8778 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Florence Tan and Chen Aizhu; additional reporting by Andrew Hayley in Beijing, Aziz El Yaakoubi in Riyadh and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by Sonali Paul, Christian Schmollinger and Christina Fincher)]"

In other words, these enterprises hit the sweet spot: they’re tied to well-established businesses that also offer double-digit (percentage) upside potential, as determined by Wall Street analysts.Further, adding to the sweet nature of these blue-chip stocks, they’re all undervalued based on earnings multiples. To be fair, some of these ideas may have suffered some volatility this year.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$474 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$475). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Lockheed Martin Insiders Are Selling The StockWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Lockheed Martin recently. In total, insiders sold US$8.0m worth of shares in that time. Meanwhile insider John Donovan bought US$251k worth. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Lockheed Martin Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Lockheed Martin insiders own about US$94m worth of shares. That equates to 0.08% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?The stark truth for Lockheed Martin is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We'd practice some caution before buying! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin. While conducting our analysis, we found that Lockheed Martin has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”18.

Here is what the firm has to say:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”11.

These stakes have a consolidated value of $28.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

For more space stocks, head on over to 5 Best Space Stocks To Invest In. These days, one of the hottest industries is astronautics. This particular industry has been capturing public attention for years now, with the last space mania taking place in the late 1900s when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) became the first space (and only) space agency in human history to land humans on the Moon. NASA's massive success, which took place through the Apollo program, ignited government interest in space exploration and research - the result of which was the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS is a space laboratory that orbits the Earth more than fifteen times a day at a speed of 27,600 kilometers per hour and an altitude of 412 kilometers. It was built through a collaboration between the U.S. and Russia, with later modules being provided by Japan and the European Space Agency (ESA). The ISS has played a major role in reigniting public interest in space exploration, especially at the turn of this century, particularly in the U.S. This is due to the fact that the station was built by missions conducted by the Space Shuttle - the first true space plane that took off from Earth on a rocket but landed back on the ground by using its wings.However, in the background, the ISS has silently made major contributions to science and technology as well. Space exploration is often heavily criticized due to the massive costs of developing both rockets and other equipment. The space station does cost a massive $3.1 billion to maintain annually, and it's estimated that so far, NASA has spent $100 billion on the space laboratory. At the same, there are a wide variety of technology spinoffs from both the station itself and from other NASA research. Since astronauts live and work on the station for months at a time, they need advanced life support systems to survive. These have led to the development of complex water filtration layers, which are used to purify even the sweat that comes off the crew's body as they exercise in space.Story continuesThese life support systems also include research on indoor farming, as while astronauts do not grow all of their food in orbit, they are still researching indoor food technologies which have led to several startups using NASA technology to make similar products and systems on Earth. Astronauts on the space station also have to perform spacewalks to repair, maintain, and upgrade the station and the technology used in their helmets has also been used to develop scratch resistant sunglasses and welder glasses. Finally, another crucial NASA spinoff technology is the space blanket, which is crucial in first aid applications to prevent hypothermia and shock and was initially developed as a shielding blanket for the space station.After the Space Shuttle retired, the crew was launched to the ISS through Russia's Soyuz rockets, which led to little fanfare in America. However, the station would prove critical in the rise of today's darling of the astronautics industry, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX). SpaceX is the only company in the world that is capable of vertically landing its rockets and reusing them. This is through its Falcon 9 rocket, a launch vehicle that had been designed specifically to meet the requirements of the Dragon spacecraft. And the Dragon is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) programs that have outsourced the delivery of both crew and cargo to the ISS.However, the space industry itself isn't all about NASA and SpaceX. The private sector is slowly growing and so far, the biggest private sector portion of astronautics is satellites. Humans have been using satellites for a variety of tasks such as imagery, communications, and the internet for decades now, and as companies like SpaceX dramatically reduce the cost of space access, this industry is also growing. In fact, SpaceX itself operates the world's largest satellite constellation, Starlink, which is made of thousands of small satellites orbiting the Earth to provide global internet connectivity.These days though, the buzz in the industry is all about big rockets. And by big, we mean huge. Late last year, NASA successfully launched the Space Launch System (SLS). The SLS stands at more than three hundred feet tall, and after last year's successful liftoff, is currently the most powerful operational rocket on Earth since it is capable of generating a massive 8.8 million pounds of thrust. On top of the rocket is NASA's Orion spacecraft, part of which is manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).However, even as NASA is racing towards making the next Artemis rocket as it recently joined all of the vehicle's major components together and unboxed the engines, it is facing the heat from SpaceX. SpaceX was after all formed not to send a crew to the space station, but to Mars. And to achieve this, the company is building the world's largest rocket called Starship in Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship is designed to stand at a massive 390 feet tall and churn out an absolute eye popping 17.1 million pounds of thrust in order to meet the power and capacity requirements for Martian missions. And a highly anticipated orbital test flight for the rocket might be around the corner as well, with some estimates suggesting that can take place as soon as next month.Yet, while SpaceX aims for Mars and NASA looks at the Moon, the world's largest aeronautics firm The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is racing to launch its crewed vehicle to the space station. And for Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), whose solid rocket boosters power the SLS and the firm responsible for manufacturing the James Webb Telescope, business is booming as highlighted by management in a recent earnings call:In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world’s most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company. In 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions.We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale. Further, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA’s base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we’ve made in solid rocket motor capabilities. We also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top space stocks, with the notable picks being Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).11 Best Space Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe have focused on pure play space companies for the most part of this piece, however, companies that are essential to the sector but have other business divisions too are also mentioned.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Medtronic How Much Debt Does Medtronic Carry?As you can see below, at the end of January 2023, Medtronic had US$28.1b of debt, up from US$25.1b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have US$11.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$16.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Medtronic's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Medtronic had liabilities of US$14.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$28.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$11.1b and US$5.89b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$25.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit isn't so bad because Medtronic is worth a massive US$105.6b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Medtronic's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.0), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 12.3 times, makes us even more comfortable. The bad news is that Medtronic saw its EBIT decline by 15% over the last year. If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Medtronic can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Medtronic generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 86% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewMedtronic's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But we must concede we find its EBIT growth rate has the opposite effect. It's also worth noting that Medtronic is in the Medical Equipment industry, which is often considered to be quite defensive. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Medtronic can handle its debt fairly comfortably. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. Another positive for shareholders is that it pays dividends. So if you like receiving those dividend payments, check Medtronic's dividend history, without delay!When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

(NYSE:RSG) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-republic-services-inc-122053847.html,1679833253.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Republic Services' shares before the 31st of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.49 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.98 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Republic Services has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current share price of $130.92. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Republic Services Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Republic Services's payout ratio is modest, at just 41% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 34% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Republic Services, with earnings per share up 4.4% on average over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Republic Services has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.4% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Republic Services got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Republic Services is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Republic Services is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. There's a lot to like about Republic Services, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while Republic Services looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Republic Services that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

For more space stocks, head on over to 5 Best Space Stocks To Invest In. These days, one of the hottest industries is astronautics. This particular industry has been capturing public attention for years now, with the last space mania taking place in the late 1900s when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) became the first space (and only) space agency in human history to land humans on the Moon. NASA's massive success, which took place through the Apollo program, ignited government interest in space exploration and research - the result of which was the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS is a space laboratory that orbits the Earth more than fifteen times a day at a speed of 27,600 kilometers per hour and an altitude of 412 kilometers. It was built through a collaboration between the U.S. and Russia, with later modules being provided by Japan and the European Space Agency (ESA). The ISS has played a major role in reigniting public interest in space exploration, especially at the turn of this century, particularly in the U.S. This is due to the fact that the station was built by missions conducted by the Space Shuttle - the first true space plane that took off from Earth on a rocket but landed back on the ground by using its wings.However, in the background, the ISS has silently made major contributions to science and technology as well. Space exploration is often heavily criticized due to the massive costs of developing both rockets and other equipment. The space station does cost a massive $3.1 billion to maintain annually, and it's estimated that so far, NASA has spent $100 billion on the space laboratory. At the same, there are a wide variety of technology spinoffs from both the station itself and from other NASA research. Since astronauts live and work on the station for months at a time, they need advanced life support systems to survive. These have led to the development of complex water filtration layers, which are used to purify even the sweat that comes off the crew's body as they exercise in space.Story continuesThese life support systems also include research on indoor farming, as while astronauts do not grow all of their food in orbit, they are still researching indoor food technologies which have led to several startups using NASA technology to make similar products and systems on Earth. Astronauts on the space station also have to perform spacewalks to repair, maintain, and upgrade the station and the technology used in their helmets has also been used to develop scratch resistant sunglasses and welder glasses. Finally, another crucial NASA spinoff technology is the space blanket, which is crucial in first aid applications to prevent hypothermia and shock and was initially developed as a shielding blanket for the space station.After the Space Shuttle retired, the crew was launched to the ISS through Russia's Soyuz rockets, which led to little fanfare in America. However, the station would prove critical in the rise of today's darling of the astronautics industry, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX). SpaceX is the only company in the world that is capable of vertically landing its rockets and reusing them. This is through its Falcon 9 rocket, a launch vehicle that had been designed specifically to meet the requirements of the Dragon spacecraft. And the Dragon is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) programs that have outsourced the delivery of both crew and cargo to the ISS.However, the space industry itself isn't all about NASA and SpaceX. The private sector is slowly growing and so far, the biggest private sector portion of astronautics is satellites. Humans have been using satellites for a variety of tasks such as imagery, communications, and the internet for decades now, and as companies like SpaceX dramatically reduce the cost of space access, this industry is also growing. In fact, SpaceX itself operates the world's largest satellite constellation, Starlink, which is made of thousands of small satellites orbiting the Earth to provide global internet connectivity.These days though, the buzz in the industry is all about big rockets. And by big, we mean huge. Late last year, NASA successfully launched the Space Launch System (SLS). The SLS stands at more than three hundred feet tall, and after last year's successful liftoff, is currently the most powerful operational rocket on Earth since it is capable of generating a massive 8.8 million pounds of thrust. On top of the rocket is NASA's Orion spacecraft, part of which is manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).However, even as NASA is racing towards making the next Artemis rocket as it recently joined all of the vehicle's major components together and unboxed the engines, it is facing the heat from SpaceX. SpaceX was after all formed not to send a crew to the space station, but to Mars. And to achieve this, the company is building the world's largest rocket called Starship in Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship is designed to stand at a massive 390 feet tall and churn out an absolute eye popping 17.1 million pounds of thrust in order to meet the power and capacity requirements for Martian missions. And a highly anticipated orbital test flight for the rocket might be around the corner as well, with some estimates suggesting that can take place as soon as next month.Yet, while SpaceX aims for Mars and NASA looks at the Moon, the world's largest aeronautics firm The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is racing to launch its crewed vehicle to the space station. And for Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), whose solid rocket boosters power the SLS and the firm responsible for manufacturing the James Webb Telescope, business is booming as highlighted by management in a recent earnings call:In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world’s most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company. In 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions.We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale. Further, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA’s base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we’ve made in solid rocket motor capabilities. We also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top space stocks, with the notable picks being Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).11 Best Space Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe have focused on pure play space companies for the most part of this piece, however, companies that are essential to the sector but have other business divisions too are also mentioned.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”18.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs.

Here is what the firm has to say:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), an American beverage company, holds one of the longest dividend growth track records of 61 years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.02%, as of March 25.

These stakes have a consolidated value of $28.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

For more space stocks, head on over to 5 Best Space Stocks To Invest In. These days, one of the hottest industries is astronautics. This particular industry has been capturing public attention for years now, with the last space mania taking place in the late 1900s when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) became the first space (and only) space agency in human history to land humans on the Moon. NASA's massive success, which took place through the Apollo program, ignited government interest in space exploration and research - the result of which was the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS is a space laboratory that orbits the Earth more than fifteen times a day at a speed of 27,600 kilometers per hour and an altitude of 412 kilometers. It was built through a collaboration between the U.S. and Russia, with later modules being provided by Japan and the European Space Agency (ESA). The ISS has played a major role in reigniting public interest in space exploration, especially at the turn of this century, particularly in the U.S. This is due to the fact that the station was built by missions conducted by the Space Shuttle - the first true space plane that took off from Earth on a rocket but landed back on the ground by using its wings.However, in the background, the ISS has silently made major contributions to science and technology as well. Space exploration is often heavily criticized due to the massive costs of developing both rockets and other equipment. The space station does cost a massive $3.1 billion to maintain annually, and it's estimated that so far, NASA has spent $100 billion on the space laboratory. At the same, there are a wide variety of technology spinoffs from both the station itself and from other NASA research. Since astronauts live and work on the station for months at a time, they need advanced life support systems to survive. These have led to the development of complex water filtration layers, which are used to purify even the sweat that comes off the crew's body as they exercise in space.Story continuesThese life support systems also include research on indoor farming, as while astronauts do not grow all of their food in orbit, they are still researching indoor food technologies which have led to several startups using NASA technology to make similar products and systems on Earth. Astronauts on the space station also have to perform spacewalks to repair, maintain, and upgrade the station and the technology used in their helmets has also been used to develop scratch resistant sunglasses and welder glasses. Finally, another crucial NASA spinoff technology is the space blanket, which is crucial in first aid applications to prevent hypothermia and shock and was initially developed as a shielding blanket for the space station.After the Space Shuttle retired, the crew was launched to the ISS through Russia's Soyuz rockets, which led to little fanfare in America. However, the station would prove critical in the rise of today's darling of the astronautics industry, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX). SpaceX is the only company in the world that is capable of vertically landing its rockets and reusing them. This is through its Falcon 9 rocket, a launch vehicle that had been designed specifically to meet the requirements of the Dragon spacecraft. And the Dragon is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) programs that have outsourced the delivery of both crew and cargo to the ISS.However, the space industry itself isn't all about NASA and SpaceX. The private sector is slowly growing and so far, the biggest private sector portion of astronautics is satellites. Humans have been using satellites for a variety of tasks such as imagery, communications, and the internet for decades now, and as companies like SpaceX dramatically reduce the cost of space access, this industry is also growing. In fact, SpaceX itself operates the world's largest satellite constellation, Starlink, which is made of thousands of small satellites orbiting the Earth to provide global internet connectivity.These days though, the buzz in the industry is all about big rockets. And by big, we mean huge. Late last year, NASA successfully launched the Space Launch System (SLS). The SLS stands at more than three hundred feet tall, and after last year's successful liftoff, is currently the most powerful operational rocket on Earth since it is capable of generating a massive 8.8 million pounds of thrust. On top of the rocket is NASA's Orion spacecraft, part of which is manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).However, even as NASA is racing towards making the next Artemis rocket as it recently joined all of the vehicle's major components together and unboxed the engines, it is facing the heat from SpaceX. SpaceX was after all formed not to send a crew to the space station, but to Mars. And to achieve this, the company is building the world's largest rocket called Starship in Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship is designed to stand at a massive 390 feet tall and churn out an absolute eye popping 17.1 million pounds of thrust in order to meet the power and capacity requirements for Martian missions. And a highly anticipated orbital test flight for the rocket might be around the corner as well, with some estimates suggesting that can take place as soon as next month.Yet, while SpaceX aims for Mars and NASA looks at the Moon, the world's largest aeronautics firm The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is racing to launch its crewed vehicle to the space station. And for Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), whose solid rocket boosters power the SLS and the firm responsible for manufacturing the James Webb Telescope, business is booming as highlighted by management in a recent earnings call:In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world’s most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company. In 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions.We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale. Further, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA’s base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we’ve made in solid rocket motor capabilities. We also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top space stocks, with the notable picks being Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).11 Best Space Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe have focused on pure play space companies for the most part of this piece, however, companies that are essential to the sector but have other business divisions too are also mentioned.

In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate.

After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free!

Here is what the firm has to say:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.6bUS$12.1bUS$12.9bUS$13.5bUS$14.1bUS$14.6bUS$15.1bUS$15.5bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 6.62%Est @ 5.26%Est @ 4.30%Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.16%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.61%Est @ 2.45% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10.0% US$9.7kUS$10.0kUS$9.7kUS$9.3kUS$8.8kUS$8.3kUS$7.8kUS$7.3kUS$6.8kUS$6.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10.0%– 2.1%) = US$211bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$211b÷ ( 1 + 10.0%)10= US$82bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$165b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$125, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.329. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The banking crisis that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank continues, leaving what look like bargains but could be yield traps.The easiest way to seek safety is to look at the dividend-paying bank stocks from banks that deposited $30 billion into First Republic (NYSE:FRC) on March 16. These are the “too big to fail” banks the government backed in 2008.In the current crisis Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) each deposited $5 billion at First Republic. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) each put in half that.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTwo other big national banks, State Street (NYSE:STT) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) also put in $1 billion each, but their dividend yields are low. Citigroup, with a yield of 4.55%, leads the way.These are the dividend-paying bank stocks offering the best combination of safety and yield for the average investor who wants to take advantage of the current crisis to build a nest egg for tomorrow.TFCTruist Financial$32.55USBUS Bancorp$34.97PNCPNC Financial$122.01CCitigroup$43.32Truist Financial (TFC)Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTruist Financial (NYSE:TFC), the largest regional bank in the Southeast, was born from the 2019 merger of BB&amp;T Bancshares of Winston-Salem with SunTrust of Atlanta. The two decided the merged company would be based in Charlotte. (Full disclosure: I have my business bank account at Truist.)The bank had assets of $555 billion at the end of 2022, up 2.6% from a year earlier. The book value per share is $40.58, giving it a price-to-book of about .77 on March 20. At the start of March, the shares sold at almost $47. That means it’s down 23% on the month.Rebellion Research, which uses machine learning to rate securities, insists Truist is in great shape. Bad loans encumber only 16.56% of the equity, and they don’t intend to sell them. Citigroup raised its rating on Truist amid the crisis, calling any comparison with SVB “apples to oranges” because of the broad swath of industries its deposits support. The bank’s 18 analysts think Truist will report $1.17 of earnings this quarter, $4.89 per share for the year. That’s a forward price-earnings ratio of just 6.5.Story continuesUS Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comUS Bancorp (NYSE:USB) takes its name from a Portland bank founded in 1891. It has been based in Minneapolis since buying First Trust Bank in 1997. That bank traces its history back to 1864. USB had assets of $674 billion at the end of 2022, making it the fifth largest U.S. bank, behind only the four money center banks. It has a market cap of $59 billion and a price to book value of 1.148 as of March 17.Besides its consumer banking, commercial banking, and wealth management operations, USB is also the seventh largest credit card bank, behind Discover (NYSE:DFS) and ahead of Wells Fargo.While its franchise is regional, with branches in the Midwest and western U.S., its banking footprint is national. Near the end of last year it acquired MUFG Union Bank, increasing its franchise on the West Coast.Baird upgraded USB as a “rare opportunity” in the current sell-off the same day Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) was taken over. Along with the dividend yield, it has a price-earnings ratio of just 10.5. Over $31 in cash backs each share of stock. On March 6 the shares were trading at $47. That means it’s off 27% since the start of the crisis, with no news on outflows to justify it. One caveat is that “Big Short” investor Michael Burry worries that over half of USB’s deposits are uninsured, because they’re in accounts over the $250,000 FDIC limit for insurance. He thinks it is susceptible to a run. I think it is more important that USB is geographically diversified, with accounts in a wide range of industries.The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comPNC (NYSE:PNC), based in Pittsburgh, is the dominant bank of the mid-Atlantic, but does a lot of things beyond standard banking.It has offices in 25 states. Its biggest concentrations outside the Midwest are in Atlanta and the Atlantic coast of Florida.PNC does mergers for smaller companies, it handles loan syndications, and it’s the second largest servicer of loans for other banks. It’s also one handler of Small Business Association (SBA) loans and a major credit card bank. It was formed from the 1983 merger of Provident and Penn National, both of which used the initials PNC.PNC had assets of $557 billion at the end of 2022, making it the sixth largest U.S. bank. Almost all the loans are domestic. The market cap of $55 billion gives it a price-earnings ratio of under 14 and a fat dividend yield of 4.8%. Its price-to-book is currently 1.39.PNC was big enough to be approached on an SVB bailout but turned it down. Rebellion Research recently calculated it has just $4.4 billion in losses on $40 billion of booked loans, and that its balance sheet looks good.Analysts at Baird see a 50% upside in the bank’s stock. Tipranks also sees the stock beating the market this year. On March 15, a black day for bank stocks, PNC stock fell less than its peers.Citigroup (C)A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong. Citigroup layoffsSource: TungCheung / Shutterstock.comCitigroup (NYSE:C) is the only money center bank with a 4% dividend yield. It went through a reverse split of 1:10 after the 2008 financial crisis and the stock has never returned to its pre-crisis level.Citi is a huge credit card bank, besides being an international lender. (Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) moved its credit card business to Citi a few years ago.) It even has its own travel portal, run with Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG)The dividend compensates for a distinct lack of capital gains. Over the last two years, the stock has lost 37% of its value. Over one-third of its business is international, and it has just 661 domestic branches, lowest among the seven largest U.S. banks. The price-to-book ratio is just .42.Some analysts consider Citi a gift at the current price. Bank of America recently raised its price target on the bank and gave it a buy rating.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in COST.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) are popular among investors due to their long dividend growth track records. In addition to this, these companies have strong cash flow generation that promises further dividend growth.

(NYSE:MO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We rebalanced our tobacco exposure during the year, reducing our investment in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) as the future of the company’s combustible cigarette business became increasingly questionable given pending US legislation and a lackluster portfolio of reduced risk products. We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”19. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company, based in New York. On March 9, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. It has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 14 years.

(NYSE:PM), with a total value of over $6.2 billion.Broyhill Asset Management mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”18.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”17.

Here is what the firm has to say:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

If you want to see more states in this selection, go to the 5 Cheapest States to Live In.The rise in inflation over the last year has led many Americans to consider shifting to states with a lower cost of living. The annual inflation rate rose to 9.1% in June 2022 to its highest level since the 1980s. To combat the raging inflation, the US Federal Reserve has already raised the benchmark interest rates by 450 basis points (bps) since March 2022. The benchmark interest rates were in the range of 0% to 0.25% in March last year and are now hovering around the 4.5% to 4.75% range. Economists at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America believe that the Federal Reserve intends to raise the interest rate further to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% in 2023. This could be done by increasing the benchmark interest rates by 25 bps on three occasions this year.Which States Young Americans are Moving To?The movement of people within the United States, and its impact on local housing markets, is one of the factors contributing to inflation levels in different states. Based on the number of address change requests from the United States Postal Service over the years 2019-2021, it appears that a significant number of Americans migrated out of states such as New York, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Meanwhile, Florida, Texas, and Georgia saw a large influx of new residents during this period. Redfin, the real estate broker, released an analysis indicating that the correlation between migration and inflation has become notably stronger as an increasing number of people move from costly coastal cities to more reasonably-priced metropolitan areas. According to an analysis by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), Washington, D.C., experienced a population decline in 2022, with over 3,600 residents leaving the city. One possible explanation for why more individuals relocated to Southern and Western states is due to lower taxes, as stated by the Tax Foundation. High-tax states, such as California and New York, had a net loss of residents in 2022.Story continuesRecent Trends in MigrationThe rising inflation, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in many changes in lifestyles, such as an increasing preference to work from home, which led to numerous families relocating to find more affordable places to reside. This trend has continued into 2022, with hundreds of thousands of individuals choosing to move to different states. However, despite the pandemic causing significant disruption, the Brookings Institution reported that the historical trend of migration is slowing down in the long run. For example, from 2021 to 2022, only 9% of Americans relocated, including both local and long-range moves. This percentage is considerably lower compared to the 1940s - 1960s, when around 20% of Americans relocated each year. However, according to Brookings, longer-distance migration has increased in recent years, indicating that Americans are finding new employment opportunities in various parts of the country.Businesses contribute significantly to state-by-state variations in the cost of living in the USA. For instance, businesses that offer housing units, such as construction companies and property management agencies, directly affect a state’s cost of living. The cost of labor, building materials, and land acquisition significantly impact the prices of rental units and houses. In states with a reputation for a high cost of living, such as California and New York, housing costs are a significant contributor. Similarly, retail companies like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) influence the cost of living across many states. For example, the everyday low pricing strategy of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) helps reduce the cost of living in states where the retail behemoth is well-established.15 Cheapest States to Live Incarlos-alfonso-AlBgcDfDG_s-unsplashOur MethodologyWe have referred to three prominent sources, namely World Population Review, Council for Community and Economic Research (CCER), and Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC), to compute the average weighted cost of living index for 2023. The national average cost of living is set at 100. Hence, a lower cost of living index reflects greater affordability. We have ranked the states in descending order of their average weighted cost of living index.Cheapest States to Live In15. TexasAverage Weighted Cost of Living Index: 92.30Texas has the distinction of being one of the nine US states with no state taxes, which results in significant cost savings for residents. Furthermore, due to the abundance of natural resources like crude oil and natural gas, the energy cost is lower in the state. Texas also has a strong agricultural industry, which results in lower food prices compared to other states. Moreover, the cost of land in Texas is relatively low, and there are fewer zoning restrictions, making it an affordable place to live. Additionally, the state has a reputation for being business-friendly, with lower business taxes and fewer regulations, making it attractive to entrepreneurs looking to start a new business venture.14. NebraskaAverage Weighted Cost of Living Index: 91.90Nebraska is widely known for being an affordable state to live in, especially when compared to other US states. One of the main reasons for this is that the cost of housing in the state is 17% lower than the national average. Furthermore, the cost of utilities is 12.9% lower when compared to the national average. The Midwestern state has the fourth lowest cost of utilities amongst all US states, according to MERIC. Besides, Nebraska is a leader in the production of several essential crops, including dry edible beans, eggs, grain sorghum, popcorn, pork, and soybeans. This means that residents can benefit from lower food prices while enjoying high-quality products produced in their state.13. MichiganAverage Weighted Cost of Living Index: 91.62Michigan is one of the seven Midwestern US states on our list of the 15 cheapest states to live in. Housing in the Midwestern states tends to be more affordable than in other regions of the US. This is because the cost of land is generally lower, and housing supply tends to exceed demand in many areas as people are more focused on moving toward bigger cities on the east and west coasts. The Great Lake State has a relatively high concentration of manufacturing and industrial jobs, which tend to pay well and has a lower sales tax that plays its part in keeping the cost of living low.12.

West VirginiaAverage Weighted Cost of Living Index: 90.18West Virginia has the second cheapest housing among all the states in the US. The average house price in the Mountain State is 31.2% lower than the national average. The lower housing prices are due to the state’s rural nature, which means that there are fewer large cities and lower demand for housing.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years.

After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free!

The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

To skip our detailed analysis of the communications sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy Now.The communications service sector is traditionally considered to include only media and broadcasting companies. However, in recent times, the sector has become more diversified with the inclusion of several technology companies as well. The Global Industry Classification Standard launched a new communication services sector in September 2018, and this is what brought about the change in what is classified as communications stocks. As a result of this new sector categorization, even some of the FANG stocks — Facebook (Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) — joined the communication services sector. The inclusion of these stocks in the sector highlights the inherent diversity of the communications sector, which was then turned into one of the largest sectors in the S&amp;P 500.According to a Baron Funds report on the communications sector published in October 2018, with the above-mentioned changes, this sector became the sixth-largest sector in the S&amp;P 500, accounting for about 9% of the index by weight. The inclusion of mega tech companies alongside traditional communication services companies like AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and  T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) meant that the communication sector was one that was ever-expanding. Today, it includes media, broadcasting, entertainment, telecommunications, and even technology companies. This diversification may be why the sector has been performing well in 2023. In January, the S&amp;P 500 communication services sector rose by about 12.7%, while the broader benchmark rose by merely 6.6%, for instance.A major reason for the expansion and continued growth of the communications sector is the COVID-19 pandemic, as illustrated by the examples of the social media, streaming services, and mobile connectivity areas within communication services. The pandemic revolutionized the communications sector and led to a growth in the number of mobile subscribers in 2020. According to a GSM Association report published in 2020, the number of mobile connections rose from 5.2 billion at the end of 2019 to 7.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020. The growing use of enterprise messaging, online meetings, and online team collaborations since 2020 has also led to forecasts expecting the Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) market to grow exponentially. In 2024, this market is expected to be valued at $24.8 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% between 2020 and 2024.Story continuesThis growth has been aided by governmental support for the communications sector. In a previous article, we mentioned how in 2021, the US government passed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that earmarked over $65 billion to upgrade broadband networks across the country. A year after this bill was passed, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was able to launch the Affordable Connectivity Program, which lowered the cost of high-speed internet services by $30 per month.Additionally, the US Department of Commerce also launched a $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program to further increase governmental support for the communications sector. With this immense growth, investors today are increasingly attracted to communications stocks, leading us to compile a list of the best stocks in this sector to buy today.11 Best Communication stocks to buy nowEvgeniiAnd/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 11 best communication stocks to buy now.Our MethodologyWe selected our list of the best communication stocks by considering hedge fund sentiment.

A key component of these lowered expectations was the company’s failure to execute in enterprise software sales, which was a fundamental part of our investment thesis, so we exited the position during the quarter.”7۔ AT&amp;T Inc.

And with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the entire hydrogen sector just got a big boost.  Specifically, the bill devotes $9.5 billion to the development of green hydrogen. And green hydrogen producers are eligible for a tax credit.  This is exciting news for investors who are already investing in hydrogen stocks or looking to buy stocks in the sector.  If you’re  looking to invest in the sector, here are a few hydrogen stocks that are good investments now and have strong, long-term outlooks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAPDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$273HJENDirexion Hydrogen ETF$14.30PLUGPlug Power$11.80Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD) Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD). is committing over $15 billion by 2027 to deliver large amounts of clean hydrogen. It also owns and operates over 100 hydrogen plants and plans to invest approximately $4 billion in a huge, green-hydrogen production facility in Texas.  APD is not a pure-play hydrogen stock, but in a market like this, that could be its greatest strength, since its revenue and earnings are constantly rising. And analysts’ mean estimates  call for the firm’s earnings to rise by an average of 16% in each of the next five years.  At a time when investors are shying away from companies with a great deal of debt, APD has a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.45%.  With a price–earnings (P/E) ratio of over 26 times, APD stock isn’t cheap. But with most analysts upbeat on the shares and their average price target of over $340 per share, investors stand to get a nice return from APD.  Plug Power (PLUG) 3d render image of hydrogen energy fuel cell from Plug PowerSource: ShutterstockIf you’re looking for pure-play hydrogen stocks, you’ll have to accept some risk. Most, if not all, of these companies are not profitable and may not be profitable for several years. Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is losing money, but it may be closer to the black than other hydrogen companies. In fact, some believe that it may be profitable, excluding some items, by the end of 2023. Story continuesPlug Power is developing fuel cells for three distinct sectors: e-mobility, material handling, and stationary power. And the company already has signed contracts to supply green hydrogen to blue-chip companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Those deals will boost its top line. And if the company gets the growth that analysts expect, it may become profitable sooner rather than later.  Analysts certainly love PLUG stock. Their mean price target for the stock is $24.44 which is more than double its current price,  Direxion Hydrogen ETF (HJEN) Tiles that say ETF on top of stacks of coins on a blue backgroundSource: kenary820 / Shutterstock Picking individual stocks can be profitable. But when it comes to a sector like hydrogen, it helps to be an expert. If you’re interested in investing in hydrogen but aren’t sure how to evaluate hydrogen companies, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be an ideal option for you. The Direxion Hydrogen ETF (NYSEARCA:HJEN) includes both of the hydrogen stocks listed above and gives investors exposure to a total of 35 companies across “five hydrogen-related sub-themes.”  This laser focus on hydrogen is one reason that the Direxion Hydrogen ETF stands out from other clean-energy ETFs. The fund’s underlying index is the Index Hydrogen Economy Index (IH2ECO).  HJEN is a relatively new ETF, as it’s only been trading publicly since 2021. In that time, HJEN stock has sunk 42%. And with investors looking for safe stocks, it may fall further. Nevertheless, with a P/E ratio of 8.61 times and a net expense ratio of just 0.45, investors should put this ETF on their watchlists. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

109,4d0cc093-091e-3051-9000-f172f6ff494f,DIS,2023-03-27,15 Most Anticipated TV Shows of 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-anticipated-tv-shows-134642790.html,1679838402,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX', 'AMZN']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most anticipated TV shows of 2023. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most anticipated TV shows of 2023.TV shows have continued to persist for decades in an industry which has been consistently changing for several years. Half a century ago, there weren't many options in the way of entertainment, with internet distractions not available, and only a few options available in terms of TV shows on television due to a lack of channels. This is why most of the most watched TV shows of all time are TV shows which were created in the 1970s and 1980s, with M*A*S*H's finale being the most watched TV show episode of all time with more than 105 million viewers tuning in. The show was produced by CBS, which in turn is owned by Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). Most of the revenue earned by TV show producers comes from commercials aired during broadcast, and the M*A*S*H series finale saw CBS charge $450,000 for 30 second commercial blocks, an unheard amount for 1983 and even higher than the Super Bowl, which would be well over $1.38 million adjusted for inflation in 2023, something which even the most anticipated TV shows of 2023 will struggle to achieve.15 most anticipated TV shows of 2023As more and more TV shows are being produced, and other entertainment options exist as well, viewership isn't close to the levels it used to be. However, the industry has rapidly evolved to cater to this situation and has been given a new lease on life with the advent of streaming services. While Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was the pioneer of the streaming era, other businesses soon saw the potential and jumped in, be it Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Amazon Prime, HBO with HBO Max which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) or Disney+, by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). For a decade, streaming companies continued to grow exponentially, tacking on viewers by the millions which received a massive boost in 2020 after lockdowns during the pandemic resulted in a major boost in the number of people looking to stream their television entertainment and ""binge watch"" rather than the traditional method of an episode a week. In fact, in 2020, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained a record 37 million subscribers while Disney+ crossed 100 million subscribers in just 16 months. However, in 2022, after Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced that its number of subscribers dropped which tanked its stock, taking down other streaming stocks as well, with just Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+ saw more than $300 billion in market value wiped off. High competition because of numerous strong competitors has also impacted growth rates for each streaming service, and what happens to the TV show industry will depend on the outlook of streaming companies.Story continuesAccording to Ampere Analysis, over $23 billion is expected to be spent on original content, some of which include the most anticipated TV shows of 2023. However, many countries are facing a cost of living crisis, including one of the biggest streaming markets in the United Kingdom, where the number of people with at least one paid-for video subscription fell by almost a million from just January to September 2022.To determine the most anticipated TV shows in 2023, we have checked multiple sources including Rolling Stones, Collider and The Wrap. If a show appeared first in a list of 35 shows, we assigned it a score of 35/35 =1, and 34/35 for second-place and so on. For lists appearing in multiple sources, we calculated the average score. The list was then ranked from the highest score to the lowest score, representing the average position of each TV show. We have excluded some TV shows such as The Last of Us, which has already come out in its entirety, was present on most lists and earned critical and commercial acclaim almost unanimously. So, let's take a look at the TV shows that you shouldn't miss out on, starting with:15. The MandalorianTotal score: 0.72The Mandalorian was intrinsic in making Disney+ a massive hit and helped it gain millions of subscribers in a very short amount of time. has a rating of 8.2/10 on IMDB and the first live-action series in the Star Wars franchise, with its third season premiering on March 1st.

110,9b806b8f-eea3-386d-9047-91e1cfafe1f3,OKE,2023-03-27,"Taking A Look At ONEOK, Inc.'s (NYSE:OKE) ROE",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taking-look-oneok-inc-nyse-130826029.html,1679836106,STORY,['OKE'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for ONEOK How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ONEOK is:27% = US$1.7b ÷ US$6.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.27 in profit.Does ONEOK Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see ONEOK has a similar ROE to the average in the Oil and Gas industry classification (30%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for ONEOK by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining ONEOK's Debt And Its 27% Return On EquityONEOK does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.10. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

112,8cb4dfdf-668a-3829-9b2a-48e0719a9b37,CMCSA,2023-03-27,Is It Time To Consider Buying Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-comcast-corporation-140015854.html,1679839215,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$41.11 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$33.98. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Comcast's current trading price of US$35.92 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Comcast’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Is Comcast Still Cheap?Comcast appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 28.2x is currently well-above the industry average of 13.72x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Comcast’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Comcast look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Comcast. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CMCSA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe CMCSA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CMCSA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for CMCSA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Comcast as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Comcast.If you are no longer interested in Comcast, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free!

Here is what the firm has to say:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line stands at a loss of 66 cents per share and has been revised downward by 3 cents in the past 30 days. The consensus mark indicates a drastic decline from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.Meanwhile, Micron estimates revenues of $3.80 billion (+/- $200 million). The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $3.78 billion, suggesting a 51.5% decrease from the year-earlier period’s revenues of $7.79 billion.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being -20.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayMicron’s overall second-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by soft consumer spending due to rising inflationary pressure and growing concerns over the global economic slowdown. Softened consumer spending has resulted in weak memory chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer end markets.Substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets are expected to have hurt the overall financial performance in the second quarter. Data center operators are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to the shortage of other components as well as reducing their inventories amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.Industry-wide component supply constraints across the industrial end markets are expected to have hurt Micron’s top and bottom lines in the second quarter. MU’s industrial end market customers are adjusting their DRAM and NAND memory chip purchases amid soft macroeconomic conditions.Story continuesThe memory chip maker’s heavy dependence on China is a headwind due to the ongoing tit-for-tat trade spat between the United States and China. Additionally, a higher mix of lower-margin NAND, coupled with low memory prices and a minimal decline in manufacturing costs, is expected to have strained margins.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Micron this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

In other words, these enterprises hit the sweet spot: they’re tied to well-established businesses that also offer double-digit (percentage) upside potential, as determined by Wall Street analysts.Further, adding to the sweet nature of these blue-chip stocks, they’re all undervalued based on earnings multiples. To be fair, some of these ideas may have suffered some volatility this year.

As a discount to projected earnings, CGI Inc ranks better than 63.27% of the software industry.Notably, the company carries a solid balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 4.04.

Also, it’s a highly profitable business with a net margin of 11.2%, above 80.41% of the sector. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg GIB as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $101.83, implying over 11% upside potential.

At the moment, Micron carries a market cap of $67 billion. Since the start of the year, MU gained over 15% of its equity value.

However, in the trailing year, it dropped over 20%, reflecting the troubled waters of the tech space.Still, for those seeking high-potential blue-chip stocks to buy, Qualcomm may deliver the goods. Currently, the market prices QCOM at a forward multiple of 13.07. As a discount to projected earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 78.52% of industry players.Operationally, the tech giant really shines. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 25%, above 82.62% of its peers.

Financially, the market prices BIIB at a trailing multiple of 12.48. As a discount to earnings, Biogen ranks better than 73.73% of the drug manufacturing industry.Operationally, the company could use a little bit of work on the top line.

Notably, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 16.86. As a discount to projected earnings, BioNTech ranks better than 73.77% of the underlying sector.Additionally, the company benefits from a cash-rich balance sheet. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.72, indicating low bankruptcy risk.

It too helped introduce a vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Unfortunately for MRNA, fading relevancies hurt investor sentiment. Since the beginning of this year, shares plunged over 17%.Nevertheless, for those willing to take risks with their blue-chip stocks, Moderna could be quite intriguing. For instance, the market prices MRNA at a trailing multiple of 7.42. As a discount to earnings, Moderna ranks better than 84.67% of the biotech industry.Operationally, Moderna enjoys tremendous revenue and book growth over the past three years. In terms of profitability, its net margin comes in at 44.3%, outpacing 95.34% of the field.

(NYSE:UPS) insiders disposed of US$16m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-united-parcel-120020536.html,1679918420,STORY,['UPS'],"[The fact that multiple United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceThe Executive VP and President of International, Kathleen Gutmann, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$10m worth of shares at a price of US$190 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$186. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).United Parcel Service insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).United Parcel Service Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at United Parcel Service. In total, insiders sold US$14m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes United Parcel Service Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. United Parcel Service insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$114m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we've found that United Parcel Service has 3 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:ZBH)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-zimmer-biomet-133905753.html,1679837945,STORY,['ZBH'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Zimmer Biomet Holdings is US$111 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$126 share price, Zimmer Biomet Holdings appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for ZBH is US$136, which is 23% above our fair value estimateToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.24bUS$1.59bUS$1.73bUS$1.84bUS$1.69bUS$1.60bUS$1.56bUS$1.54bUS$1.53bUS$1.54bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -4.94%Est @ -2.84%Est @ -1.37%Est @ -0.33%Est @ 0.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$1.1kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.2kUS$1.0kUS$915US$837US$773US$719(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$13bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$23b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$126, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zimmer Biomet Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.978. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Zimmer Biomet HoldingsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Mistakes are inevitable, but a single top stock pick can cover any losses, and so much more. One such superstar is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), which saw its share price soar 428% in three years. The last week saw the share price soften some 1.4%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Occidental Petroleum became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Occidental Petroleum's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Occidental Petroleum, it has a TSR of 436% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Occidental Petroleum has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 3.6% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 0.7%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Occidental Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:24% = US$3.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.24 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 23%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. As a result, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' remarkable 26% net income growth seen over the past 5 years is likely aided by its high ROE.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 36% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is VRTX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Income-generating stocks that allow regular and passive income are usually investors’ top choices in inflationary environments. In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:MO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We rebalanced our tobacco exposure during the year, reducing our investment in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) as the future of the company’s combustible cigarette business became increasingly questionable given pending US legislation and a lackluster portfolio of reduced risk products. We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”19. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company, based in New York. On March 9, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which was consistent with its previous dividend. It has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 14 years.

(NYSE:PM), with a total value of over $6.2 billion.Broyhill Asset Management mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”18.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Despite having already addressed excess inventories, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) reported a disappointing third quarter and further cut fourth quarter guidance. Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”17.

Here is what the firm has to say:“LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”11.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

134,547c2a82-de2a-309c-a3b3-e3c9b2ba0f3d,INCY,2023-03-27,Incyte Announces Japanese Approval of Pemazyre® (pemigatinib) for the Treatment of Patients with Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms (MLNs),Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-announces-japanese-approval-pemazyre-060000686.html,1679896800,STORY,['INCY'],"[WILMINGTON, Del. &amp; TOKYO, March 27, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has approved Pemazyre® (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, for the treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 fusion (also known as 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome). MLNs are a rare, aggressive group of cancers characterized by an over-production of myeloid cells, or bone tissue, with the tendency to rapidly progress to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML).""The MHLW approval of Pemazyre in MLNs is an important step toward potentially providing a therapeutic option for Japanese patients with this rare condition,"" said Lothar Finke, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President and General Manager, Incyte Asia. ""Bringing this first and only approved therapy to MLN patients in Japan demonstrates Incyte’s commitment to finding solutions for critical unmet medical needs regardless of the size of the patient population – as is the case with MLNs, an extremely rare disease that is estimated to affect fewer than 100 patients worldwide.""The approval was based on data from the Phase 2 FIGHT-203 study, a multicenter open-label, single-arm trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Pemazyre in 41 patients in myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 fusion gene positive who received Pemazyre 13.5 mg orally once daily continuously or intermittently. The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed complete response rate, was 62.5% (95% CI: 45.8 - 77.3). The complete response rate in the continuous dosing population was 66.7% (95% CI: 46.0 - 83.5). The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving Pemazyre were hyperphosphatemia (70.7%), alopecia (56.1%), diarrhea (43.9%) and stomatitis (43.9%).Previously, the MHLW granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for Pemazyre – a designation granted to investigational compounds intended to treat rare diseases that affect fewer than 50,000 people in Japan, and for which there is a high medical need1. Designated orphan drugs are also eligible for priority review for marketing authorizations to ensure supply to clinical settings at the earliest opportunity1. The MLN ODD is the second such designation granted to Pemazyre by the MHLW, having also received ODD for cholangiocarcinoma, a type of biliary tract cancer.Story continuesMLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement are a form of very rare hematological cancers caused by a chromosomal abnormality (translocation) in which the chromosome breaks where the FGFR1 gene is located (position 11 in the short arm of chromosome 8: location 8p11) and fuses with fragments (genes) of other chromosomes. Various partner genes cause a constitutive activation of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase, impacting cell proliferation and survival. These cancers are largely divided into two phases according to clinical presentation: the chronic phase, if diagnosed as myeloproliferative disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute phase, if diagnosed as acute leukemia. The prognosis is unfavorable, and while allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is considered to be the only currently available treatment option that may achieve cure or long-term remission, no standard of care has been established.About FIGHT-203FIGHT-203 is a Phase 2, multicenter trial that enrolled patients 18 years and older with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) rearrangement. Sponsored by Incyte, the study evaluated the safety and efficacy of pemigatinib for the treatment of adults with MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement. Patients received pemigatinib 13.5 mg once daily in 21-day cycles, either on a continuous schedule (the approved recommended starting dosage for use in patients with MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement) or as an intermittent schedule (14 days on, 7 days off, an unapproved dosage regimen in MLN with FGFR1 rearrangement). Pemigatinib was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until patients were able to receive allo-HSCT. For more information about the study, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03011372.About PemigatinibPemazyre is a kinase inhibitor indicated in the United States for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test2. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).Pemazyre is also the first targeted treatment approved for use in the United States for treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement.In Japan, Pemazyre is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (BTC) with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion gene, worsening after cancer chemotherapy and the treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement.In Europe, Pemazyre is approved for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.Pemazyre is a potent, selective, oral inhibitor of FGFR isoforms 1, 2 and 3 which, in preclinical studies, has demonstrated selective pharmacologic activity against cancer cells with FGFR alterations.Pemazyre is marketed by Incyte in the United States, Europe and Japan.Incyte has granted Innovent Biologics, Inc. rights to develop and commercialize pemigatinib in hematology and oncology in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Incyte has retained all other rights to develop and commercialize pemigatinib outside of the United States.Pemazyre is a trademark of Incyte Corporation.About IncyteIncyte is a Wilmington, Delaware-based, global biopharmaceutical company focused on finding solutions for serious unmet medical needs through the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics.

The LOI includes exploring a potential long-term strategic partnership to extract and recycle plastics out of incineration waste streams. This proposed collaboration would potentially include construction of waste pre-sorting facilities at or near EEW incineration plants to remove plastics from waste streams bound for incineration, and investment in advanced sorting facilities to further sort and refine the plastic that has been removed. This collaboration supports the new LyondellBasell strategy to invest in advanced sorting infrastructure to produce plastic waste-based feedstocks, grow its Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business, and deliver on its value creation ambitions.""Collaborations across the value chain are part of our strategy and are increasingly necessary to free up plastic waste from sources that today do not end up in recycling,"" says Yvonne van der Laan, LyondellBasell executive vice president, Circular and Low Carbon Solutions. ""The materials from these sorting facilities would not only support our existing mechanical recycling facilities in the Netherlands and a potential advanced recycling unit in Germany, but also allows us to optimize waste streams and drive additional value.""This collaboration would close the loop on plastics that are today sent for incineration, by sorting them out for use as feedstock in mechanical and advance recycling processes. By removing these materials from the incineration waste stream, the fossil CO2 emissions associated with combusting the materials are also avoided.""With this cooperation, we are creating a convincing solution for plastic waste for which recycling is still ruled out today,"" says Bernard M. Kemper, chief executive officer EEW Energy from Waste. ""EEW will first build a sorting facility and sort out plastics to recover them for the raw material cycle.""Story continuesThe intended cooperation represents an advancement in recycling opportunities, using the sites and technical know-how of LyondellBasell and EEW to enable a sustainable circular economy.About LyondellBasellAs a leader in the global chemical industry, LyondellBasell strives every day to be the safest, best operated and most valued company in our industry.

However, most of these consist of American and European countries. The European Court of Justice required all countries in the European Union to recognize same-sex marriages in 2018. Meanwhile, the United States established the right to same-sex marriage in 2015, and in 2022 the House passed another bill protecting same-sex marriage as reported by The Wall Street Journal.Meanwhile, Asia still has a long way to go when it comes to LGBT rights. In Brunei, acts of homosexuality can face punishments including the penalty of death by stoning. In the Aceh province of Indonesia and in Saudi Arabia, punishment can be in the form of caning or lashes. Furthermore, a number of countries have prison sentences as a form of punishment for homosexuality. In December 2022, Indonesia, which was seen as one of the more progressive countries outside of the Aceh province, also released new legislation banning sex outside marriage which will have worse consequences for LGBT people who are not allowed to marry legally.However, progress has been seen in some countries. In 2019, Taiwan became the first country to enact marriage equality in Asia, and more recently, Thailand passed a registration bill for same-sex couples that provides them with the same rights as heterosexual couples. With more discussions around issues and higher awareness, Pride marches have sprung up in a number of countries to show support for the LGBT community. Similarly, a number of Non-Profit Organizations as well as youth organizations have started taking the lead in pushing for increased rights for the LGBT communities of their respective countries. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), British American Tobacco plc (NYSE:BTI), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) are examples of some multinational companies that support LGBT rights and operate in Asia.Story continuesAccording to the LGBT+ Pride Survey of 2021 conducted by Ipsos across 27 countries, 80% of the people surveyed identified as heterosexual while 3% identified as homosexual, 4% identified as bisexual, 1% identified as pansexual or omnisexual, 1% identified as other, 1% identified as asexual, and 11% did not respond. When it came to gender identity, the global country average of those who replied with something other than male or female was 2%, and this identity was more prevalent in members of Gen Z. The Asian countries in the survey included India, Turkey, Malaysia, and China.12 Most LGBT-friendly countries in Asialazyllama/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 12 most LGBT-friendly countries in Asia.Our MethodologyIn order to shortlist the countries for this article, we looked at a number of criteria to determine their friendliness towards LGBT people. First, we considered the rankings of the most LGBT-friendly countries in Asia on surveys such as the LGBT Equality Index in Asia. We also looked at research conducted on LGBT-friendly countries by the Pew Research Center and UCLA's Williams Institute, focusing on the data for Asian countries. We considered the legislation laws for each country in Asia to see if homosexuality is legal, if same-sex unions are allowed, if LGBT people are allowed to serve in the military, if there are anti-gay discrimination laws, and if same-sex couples are allowed to adopt. We also looked at the number of LGBT-led events in the countries, especially Pride marches, and the scale of these marches. Lastly, we also looked at a number of rankings done by LGBT people and came up with our rankings below based on the consensus rankings of the sources mentioned above.Most LGBT-Friendly Countries in Asia12.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy Valero Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, R. Riggs, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$132 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$129. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. R. Riggs was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Valero Energy insiders own 0.5% of the company, currently worth about US$216m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Valero Energy Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Valero Energy shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Valero Energy insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

141,172b4d7a-03bb-30f9-a88d-416e9ab20fa7,UNH,2023-03-27,Investing in UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) five years ago would have delivered you a 139% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-unitedhealth-group-nyse-unh-140037247.html,1679839237,STORY,['UNH'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 10% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 122% the gain in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, UnitedHealth Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 17% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that UnitedHealth Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think UnitedHealth Group will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for UnitedHealth Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 139%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that UnitedHealth Group returned a loss of 6.0% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 13%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 19% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future.

In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors. Last year’s returns also show the prominence of dividend stocks over their peers. The S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index fell by 1.11% including payouts in 2022, compared with an 18% decline in the S&amp;P 500. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%.Jamie Hopkins, managing partner of wealth solutions at Carson Wealth, spoke to Fortune about income investing in March. Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate. There is no exact formula to income investing, and there are a lot of ways to add income-generating assets to your portfolio.”Story continuesCompanies like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free!

The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:ORLY). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$873 and falling to the lows of US$771. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether O'Reilly Automotive's current trading price of US$811 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at O'Reilly Automotive’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive What Is O'Reilly Automotive Worth?O'Reilly Automotive appears to be overvalued by 24% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$811 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $653.74. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! Another thing to keep in mind is that O'Reilly Automotive’s share price is quite stable relative to the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of O'Reilly Automotive look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. O'Reilly Automotive's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ORLY’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ORLY should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ORLY for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ORLY, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

In this regard, the dividend investment strategy is the most popular among investors as it allows them to invest in companies that pay out regular dividends. These equities offer stable income to shareholders with the potential for capital appreciation. Reinvested dividends, especially those that grow year over year, are an important way to generate compounding returns over time.The contribution of dividend stocks to the overall market’s return dates back to the early 1800s. According to a study conducted by Dr. Robert Arnott, dividends were the main source of returns from 1802 to 2002, significantly outpacing inflation and other asset classes. During this period, US equities delivered an average return of 7.9%, with dividends representing 5% and real dividend growth accounting for 0.8% of the total return. They remained crucial to the overall market returns in the most recent years. Previously, we reported that compounded dividends represented over 70% of global equity returns since 1970.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks because high-interest rates period make the preservation of capital more important for investors.

Here are some comments from the analyst:“To achieve that steady stream of income, investors will build a portfolio with securities and assets like bonds, dividend-paying stocks, and real estate.

After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free!

Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”17.

The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”13.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 10 Best Stocks For Dividends. Suggested articles:12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less12 Best TaaS Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Digital Currency and Payments StocksDisclosure.

At issue is whether a valid patent can cover all the members of an identified group, or if it is limited to only those members of the group specified by the patent owner.In 2014, Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron for patent infringement over their rival drug Praluent, which works by a similar mechanism as Repatha. Both drugs use laboratory-made antibodies to block a protein called PCSK9 that inhibits the removal of bad cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve this result through different chemical combinations.Bad cholesterol, known LDL, can cause a buildup of plaque in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.Amgen sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of Repatha worldwide in 2022. Regeneron sold $130 million worth of Praluent in the United States last year, and Sanofi sold more than $400 million worth in the rest of the world.The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals nationwide, invalidated Amgen's patents that covered PCSK9-blocking drugs as a group. The Federal Circuit in 2021 ruled that Amgen's patents granted by the government lacked the kind of detailed guidelines needed to replicate the full scope of its claims without ""undue experimentation.""Story continuesUnder U.S. law, a drug patent must allow a skilled scientist to replicate an invention without excessive trial and error.Amgen told the justices the Federal Circuit wrongly applied too high a legal bar by demanding that a patent explain how to make virtually every possible version of the invention that could perform the claimed functions. It argued that a patent need only to ""enable skilled artisans to 'make and use' the invention,"" not account for the full range of possible forms the invention might take.Sanofi urged the justices to affirm the Federal Circuit's ruling, characterizing Amgen's bid as ""a blatant attempt to corner the market.""""Amgen asserted these broad, functionally defined genus claims to literally try to take Praluent off the market and away from patients,"" lawyers for Sanofi wrote in a brief.Genus claims refer to patents that cover not just one specific thing but a group of related things.President Joe Biden's administration is supporting Sanofi in the dispute.A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June.(Reporting by John Kruzel and Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

150,101c353c-c513-3198-8bce-07969ed3211d,UNP,2023-03-27,Union Pacific 2nd railroad to drop push for one-person crews,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/becomes-second-railroad-drop-push-182340637.html,1679855020,STORY,['UNP'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific has become the second major freight railroad in the past week to back away from the industry's longstanding push to cut train crews down to one person as lawmakers and regulators increasingly focus on rail safety following last month's fiery derailment in Ohio.The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad said in a statement Saturday that it had reached an agreement with the union that represents conductors to drop its proposal to take those workers out of the cabs of locomotives just months after it was pressing to test out the idea of stationing conductors in trucks in parts of its 23-state network. Norfolk Southern made a similar announcement several days earlier.The Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that forced the evacuation of roughly half the town of East Palestine near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border after officials released and burned toxic chemicals is what sparked the renewed interest in railroad safety. A bipartisan bill that's gaining support in Congress would require railroads to maintain two-person crews and make several other changes designed to reduce the chances of future derailments. And regulators, who are also pushing railroads to make reforms, were already considering a rule that would require two-person crews.The major freight railroads have long argued that technological advances — particularly the automatic braking system they were required to install in recent years — had made it unnecessary to have a second person in every locomotive. And railroad executives had said they believed that moving conductors off of trains would improve their quality of life by giving them more predictable schedules and keeping them from going on the road.But the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union and the other rail unions have long refused to agree to reducing the size of train crews because they believe train conductors play a crucial safety role and they want to preserve jobs.Story continuesThe unions say conductors help monitor track conditions and radio communications while ensuring that engineers remain alert and respond to any emergencies or mechanical problems on the train. In the case of a derailment or collision, conductors are the first ones to respond before any additional help can arrive and they provide emergency responders key details about what a train is hauling.Union Pacific Executive Vice President Beth Whited said the railroad will now focus on other ways to address the concerns about demanding schedules that workers expressed during last fall's difficult contract negotiations. The rail industry reached the brink of a strike that could have crippled the economy before Congress intervened in December and imposed a contract to prevent a walkout.“We are pleased that Union Pacific is focusing on quality of life for our conductor workforce,” said Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD.Railroads have also been under pressure over the past year to improve their service because they were struggling to handle all the shipments companies want them to deliver. And the industry has been defending its safety record after eliminating nearly one-third of all railroad jobs over the past six years as railroads overhauled their operations. Unions say all those cuts have left workers spread too thin and made it more difficult to keep up with all the inspections and maintenance that are needed.The railroads maintain that they remain the safest way to transport hazardous chemicals and all kinds of other cargo across land because nearly every shipment arrives intact, but the East Palestine derailment reinforced just how devastating even one derailment involving dangerous chemicals can be.]"
