0,9e3e538b-85de-3238-80f9-109c9697103d,TXN,2023-01-08,Institutional investors must be pleased after a 6.0% gain last week that adds to Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) one-year returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-must-pleased-6-120108006.html,1673179268,STORY,['TXN'],"[A look at the shareholders of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 6.0% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 0.4%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Texas Instruments. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Texas Instruments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Texas Instruments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Texas Instruments is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$173m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Texas Instruments. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 2 which are concerning) .Ultimately the future is most important.

2,0c6657a7-859f-3e59-815a-abf27ccb1264,CF,2023-01-08,The 7 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-fertilizer-stocks-buy-171118672.html,1672852278,STORY,"['FMC', 'AVD', 'MOS', 'CF', 'NTR', 'UAN', 'CTVA']","[The best fertilizer stocks to buy shot up the charts last year, albeit for astoundingly horrific reasons. As the world’s top fertilizer exporter, Russia played an integral role in the broader food supply chain. However, when it decided to exercise its imperialistic ambitions by invading Ukraine, the crisis effectively blackmailed the planet.To maintain the modern world order of eschewing violence for diplomacy (except for certain extreme conditions), the free world couldn’t just let the Russians do what they pleased. Predictably, then, following several rounds of punitive economic sanctions, Moscow retaliated with its own export bans. While the Kremlin did not explicitly ban fertilizers, it gradually restricted the commodity’s transportation.Of course, because the underlying compost represents a critical cog in the food production value chain, agriculture garnered tremendous interest. In particular, investors may be able to bank on the best fertilizer stocks to buy for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMOSMosaic$42.77NTRNutrien$72.08CFCF Industries$81.74UANCVR Partners$104.43CTVACorteva$59.33FMCFMC Corp.$123.70AVDAmerican Vanguard$21.66Mosaic (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBased in Tampa, Florida, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) mines phosphate and potash. Additionally, the company collects urea for fertilizer through various international distribution networks. Per its public profile, Mosaic’s claim to fame among the best fertilizer stocks to buy is that it represents the largest U.S. producer of potash and phosphate fertilizer. In 2022, MOS gained a bit over 9% of equity value.At the moment, Gurufocus.com notes that Mosaic features eight positive signs with no yellow or red flags. As I mentioned in prior articles, that’s a rare status. Typically, even industry leaders will carry some weakness or vulnerability. Fundamentally, MOS attracts bullish investors for its cheap valuation, passive income trek, and stability in the balance sheet.Story continuesTo emphasize, Mosaic represents an objectively undervalued market idea. For instance, the market prices MOS shares at 4.6 times forward earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 5.82 times. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg Mosaic as a consensus moderate buy. Perhaps most impressively, they target a price of $65, above 48% from its end-of-2022 price.Nutrien (NTR)A photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.comOperating out of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Nutrien (NYSE:NTR) represents a Canadian fertilizer company. Notably, Nutrien is the largest producer of potash and the third-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world. Per its corporate profile, the enterprise features over 2,000 retail locations across North America, South America, and Australia with more than 23,500 employees. In 2022, NTR lost 4% of its market value.Financially, Nutrien enjoys a similar profile to Mosaic. Like its sector rival, Nutrien commands an objectively undervalued business. Currently, the market prices NTR at 5.5 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 13.4 times. As well, the company’s price-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.2 times, below the sector median of 0.84 times.To be fair, Nutrien doesn’t own the most stable balance sheet. However, it makes for this shortfall with a solid growth picture. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 13.7%, above the sector median of 7.65%. Finally, covering analysts peg NTR as a consensus moderate buy with a $101.13 price target (up 38.5%). Thus, it ranks among the best fertilizer stocks to buy.CF Industries (CF)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA major player among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) calls Deerfield, Illinois home. The company is a manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Thanks to the relevance of the underlying industry, CF generated strong returns for investors, moving up nearly 21% last year.As with other ideas listed among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, CF Industries benefits from an objectively cheap profile. Presently, Wall Street prices CF at 5.6 times trailing earnings. As mentioned above, the sector median is 13.4 times. As well, CF pips Nutrien with a slightly lower PEG ratio at 0.18 times. This stat rates favorably lower than over 89% of industry players.Still, not everyone looks at the company with rose-tinted glasses. As of this writing, TipRanks notes that CF carries a consensus analyst view of hold. However, the consensus price target stands at $114.25. Based on CF’s close at the end of last year, investors may be looking at a 34% upside potential.CVR Partners (UAN)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) manufactures and provides nitrogen fertilizer products. When the dust settled in 2022, CVR carried a market capitalization of just over $1 billion. For the year, UAN ended up gaining over 18% of equity value, making it one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.Again, similar to its peers, CVR enjoys an objectively undervalued business. Presently, Wall Street prices shares at 4.2 times trailing earnings. This stat ranks favorably below over 91% of companies in the agricultural industry. In addition, CVR commands a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 3.25 times. This compares very favorably to the sector median value of 11.8 times.To be clear, CVR’s balance sheet ranks as middling, meaning it could use some work. However, investors will be pleased that its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 17.2%, beating out nearly 75% of its rivals. Finally, its return on equity of almost 70% reflects a vastly superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits. Thus, UAN makes for a strong overall case as one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.Corteva (CTVA)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comOne of the trickier names among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) originally represented the agricultural unit of DuPont (NYSE:DD) prior to its spin-off as an independent company. Primarily, Corteva focuses on chemicals and seeds. However, it also launched a new above-ground nitrogen stabilizer one day prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Make of that what you will.Now, the challenge for prospective investors of CTVA is whether to pursue the stock’s momentum. In 2022, Corteva gained over 25% of its equity value. On paper, this performance makes CTVA one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy. That said, the company takes a step away from its peers, ranking as objectively overvalued. For instance, the market prices CTVA at 19 times forward earnings and 31.4 times trailing earnings.However, the enterprise carries decent stability in the balance sheet, particularly an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.61 times. This ranks better than over 66% of the competition. Also, covering analysts rate the shares as a consensus strong buy.FMC Corp (FMC)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, FMC Corp (NYSE:FMC) is a chemical manufacturing company that originated as an insecticide producer. Currently, the company offers solutions for various industries, including biofertilizers which help farmers improve their crops’ resilience to drought. At the end of last year, FMC carried a market cap of $15.6 billion. In 2022, it returned 13.3% of equity value for stakeholders.Similar to Corteva, FMC doesn’t exactly own an undervalued business. At best, based on Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, FMC is exactly that – fairly valued. However, the enterprise makes up for this miss with solid profitability metrics. For example, the company’s net margin stands at 11.6%, above almost 71% of the industry.In addition, analysts overall remain bullish on FMC’s prospects, rating it a consensus moderate buy. Also, one important consideration is that hedge funds have been gradually building their position in FMC since the first quarter of last year. With the smart money moving in, FMC may very well be one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.American Vanguard (AVD)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comFor those that want to take a potshot among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, American Vanguard (NYSE:AVD) may offer an interesting opportunity. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, American Vanguard produces agrochemicals and pesticide delivery systems. As well, under its Agrinos business unit, AVD develops liquid fertilizers for plant nutrition. In 2022, AVD gained a remarkably robust 33.9%.Of course, with such strong performances, there are two ways to assess the underlying investment. On the pessimistic side, it’s possible that AVD could be due for a correction. After all, fears of a global recession dominated last year’s business headlines. Still, on the optimistic front, AVD could carry momentum into this year and perhaps beyond.As a relatively small player (featuring a market cap of only $642 million), no analyst presently covers AVD. Nevertheless, this framework could change soon enough. That’s because in the past three earnings reports, the company beat per-share profitability expectations. Therefore, AVD could be one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy for risk-tolerant investors.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession. Investment advisory Barclays forecasts that 2023 will be one of the worst years for the global economy in forty years. Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession). Similarly, investors prefer to solidify their portfolios with recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In). Some of the best recession stocks to buy for 2023 include Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Story continuesOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 14 stocks that are recession proof. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like alcohol, consumer staples, healthcare, and finance. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 RecessionPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashBest Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession14. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a London-based company that produces, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages under the Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal, Don Julio, Ciroc, Buchanan's, Casamigos, J&amp;B, and Ketel One brands. Alcohol demand surges during recessions, making Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) one of the best stocks to buy before a recession hits in 2023. Consumer demand for Diageo products remains resilient worldwide. Although earnings had been fluctuant in the past, they always rebounded well, and will potentially be solid in the coming economic downturn.On January 4, Credit Suisse analyst Sanjeet Aujla raised the price target on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) to 4,500 GBp from 4,400 GBp and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 20 hedge funds held stakes worth $527.4 million in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 22 funds in the prior quarter worth $887.3 million. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.35 million shares worth $229.2 million. Like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is one of the best recession stocks to invest in. Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”13. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based company that develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products. It operates through three segments – Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and Specialty Products Division. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is one of the best recession-proof stocks to invest in this year. The company has a history of 27 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it a reliable income stock to pick up for the volatile market environment. On December 6, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers raised the firm's price target on Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) to $90 from $85 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) was part of 40 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 32 in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 8.45 million shares worth $604.2 million. Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) declined 22.7% after reporting first quarter operating results that were below expectations. The company also lowered guidance on macroeconomic concerns, with management citing softness across their product portfolio, especially for their discretionary categories, as retailers work on reducing inventory levels.”12. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) is a California-based company that sells discount retail apparel and home fashion accessories under the Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS brand names. It is one of the best stocks to buy for the 2023 recession, as customers tend to gravitate towards off-price stores during difficult times. As of December 19, Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) continues to be seen as a retail sector winner amid the holiday season and continuing inflationary headwinds.On November 21, Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih raised the price target on Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) to $127 from $98 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares. The company's Q3 earnings report ""was the second proof point that the balance of power has shifted in Off-Price's favor,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 3.95 million shares worth $333 million. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) topped the contribution list as this discount clothing and accessories retailer rebounded from oversold conditions after reporting a weak quarter. Ross continues to follow its deep discount strategy, offering consumers bargains on clothing as it executes a “packaway” inventory strategy, scooping up inventory when its buyers perceive bargains in the marketplace, then passing savings on to customers with low-cost retail locations.”11. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) operates as a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States. For full-year 2022, the company expects revenue to be between $14.1 billion and $14.3 billion, versus a consensus of $14.16 billion and GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $32.35 to $32.85, compared to the prior view of $31.25 to $31.75 and a consensus of $31.86. During recessions, customers tend to fix their old vehicles instead of purchasing new ones, which skyrockets demand for companies like O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY). On January 5, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem raised the price target on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) to $925 from $850 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. Despite industry-leading comps and positive share gains, the analyst believes a case can be made that O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) under-earned in 2022 and in 2023, he sees the benefits of a solid, needs-based category, little evidence of pricing roll back, and potential tailwinds from share gains and improving margins. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), compared to 41 funds in the last quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.47 million shares worth $1 billion. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) outperformed the Consumer Discretionary sector because its business is expected to be more resilient in an economic downturn. The company’s second quarter earnings were slightly below consensus estimates; however, the outlook for the rest of the year showed steady growth despite difficult comparisons with the second half of 2021. O’Reilly Automotive continues to grow its store base and has recently announced an expansion into Mexico. The company operates in an industry where competition has historically remained rational through the economic cycle.”10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the best stocks to buy for the 2023 recession, as demand for cheap food surges during periods of economic volatility and high unemployment. On December 15, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and five of its suppliers signed a deal to purchase almost 190 megawatts of power from Blue Jay Solar Farm. The ​​solar energy will power all the warehouses, distribution centers, and other elements of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)’s logistical supply chain for its U.S. restaurants. The company aims to reduce greenhouse emissions by 36% by 2030 and become net zero by 2050.Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein on January 5 raised the price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)’s to $310 from $295 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. To begin 2023, the analyst expects discretionary restaurants to outperform, with sales strong, pricing outsized, and inflation easing.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was part of 53 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 50 in the prior quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 2 million shares worth $487.7 million. 9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best stock picks for a recession-safe portfolio. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) will announce its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in. Income stocks are a good hedge against market volatility, as dividends help a portfolio that suffers from share price losses. The company has increased its exposure to alcoholic beverages over the last two years as well. On December 20, Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said he expects a more challenging backdrop for the global consumer in FY23 as input costs remain high and companies will be looking to raise prices in some cases. In this context, his top names in beverages include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), where he sees category momentum, continuous investment, and solid execution driving growth. The analyst has an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares with a $69 price target. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 59 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 60 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, with 400 million shares worth $22.40 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) develops, manufactures, and sells healthcare products worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Healthcare is a defensive market sector, which means firms like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) perform well despite a recession backdrop. On December 9, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, an 8.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.47. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 13. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has offered 396 consecutive quarterly dividends since 1924 and has raised the dividend payouts for 50 consecutive years, making it a solid dividend king. Barclays analyst Matt Miksic on January 4 raised the price target on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) to $122 from $114 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The macro backdrop remains constrained for medical supplies and devices, but the analyst is ""generally constructive"" on the sector, seeing improving volume trends, solid labor challenges, and ""potentially stabilizing"" supply chain and inflationary cost trends. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was part of 62 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 in the preceding quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best stocks for a recession-proof portfolio given its defensive nature. On January 5, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022.

(NYSE:UAA) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Under Armour’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Under Armour What Is Under Armour Worth?According to my valuation model, Under Armour seems to be fairly priced at around 13.31% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Under Armour today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $9.49, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Under Armour’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Under Armour?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Under Armour's revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UAA’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAA, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

But before bulls in the market get excited again at the prospect of $100 a barrel, the Chinese actions seemed geared more towards storing crude than buying it for immediate use. In the energy universe, storage is a dirty word that tends to depress, rather than lift, prices.China has also increased export quotas for refined oil products in the first batch for 2023, signaling expectations of poor domestic demand. Its focus is on the international market as independent refiners in the country see higher profits from processing Russian oil, made cheaper by the day by Western sanctions on Moscow that give the Chinese leverage to negotiate for steeper discounts.In a parallel world, Saudi Arabia’s Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) oil company this week slashed the selling price of its benchmark Arab Light crude to lows not seen since November 2021. It was a calculated move to keep Saudi barrels attractive amid persistent discounting on Russian oil after the G7 price cap of $60 per barrel on seaborne Russian crude.Already the world’s largest oil importer, China was reported on Friday to have bought five million barrels of mostly-Kazakh crude for collection from a port in the Black Sea next month, according to traders cited by Bloomberg. In daily flow terms, it’s the largest Kazakh crude purchase since at least the start of 2021.The purchase matters because Kazakh oil has been the preserve of European refiners, especially since the middle of last year when companies in the European Union cut purchases from Russia following the Ukraine invasion.The Chinese purchase seems politically motivated as well, as Kazakhstan pivots from Moscow towards Beijing, after the Ukraine invasion raised concerns about which territories in the region might be on Russia's hit list next.Physical traders report that Europe’s own demand for Kazakh oil, along with Chinese buying, has raised prices for the commodity. The so-called CPC Blend crude from Kazakhstan has rallied to a discount of $3 a barrel versus Dated Brent, an international marker for physical oil transactions. As recently as a month ago, the CPC Blend was at $8 below Dated Brent.Story continuesChina International United Petroleum&amp;Chemicals Co, or Unipec, has also bought at least 2 million barrels of crude from Norway’s Johan Sverdrup oil field for January loading. Johan Sverdrup oil is now fetching $3 to $4 a barrel below Dated Brent, having been at a discount of more than $6 in early December.But the bump-up in pricing for Kazakh CPC and Johan Sverdrup crude do not go anywhere near to mitigating the discount on Russian barrels. Before we explore Russian oil pricing in greater detail, let’s take a look at China’s demand for oil, which is a preeminent factor in valuing crude.Demand for oil in China typically rises each year after the Lunar New Year, which, this year, is due at the end of January. With Beijing going from a zero-COVID to a que-sera-sera COVID policy, there’s no telling now how its oil demand will fare. Data for the just-ended week showed Chinese manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in December, as the country grappled with an unprecedented spike in coronavirus cases.Still, some oil bulls are banking on a near-term springback in Chinese demand to lead to three-digit pricing.“Despite all of this talk of slowing demand, which is happening due to higher [U.S. interest] rates and warm weather, the reality is if you look at the big picture, supplies are still way too tight,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group and one of the most vocal on the long side of the trade. “The [supplies] will get even tighter if normal weather returns and will spike as China revs up from COVID lockdowns.”Some reject that notion.“To me, the market is oversupplied by at least 1 million barrels a day,” said Gary Ross, a veteran oil consultant-turned-hedge-fund-manager at Black Gold Investors. “We are going to have large stock builds. In a couple of weeks, you’re going to be building 10 million barrels a week; how is the market going to handle that?”If China’s economy performs slower than expected, then the large quantities of oil it is buying now will likely end up in storage. Such an expansion in storage could widen the contango in oil. Both U.S. crude and Brent are now in contango, a market dynamic where longer-dated oil is priced higher than nearby contracts, making it unprofitable for those trying to hold a futures position by rolling out of the expiring front-month into the next closest contract.At Friday’s close, the contango between the February and March contracts in U.S. crude was at 27 cents a barrel. The difference between March and April Brent was 18 cents. By historical standards, the price gaps are small. But they could grow if the storage situation expands.To make up for its tepid oil demand at home, China is ramping up output of refined oil products for export. The result would be more competition to other international suppliers of refined products, including the United States, and more pricing pressure on this front.In past years, the Chinese were major suppliers of refined products to the Pacific markets. But they slashed their refined production abruptly last year as domestic demand for oil fell — a decision that the powers-that-be in Beijing are presumably lamenting.“The Chinese totally missed out on last year’s huge crack spreads for refined products by limiting the capacity of their independent refiners,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “The Chinese thought they were protecting their internal oil market with the curtailment in production, without realizing the damage they were causing to their export market for refined products. They have also woken up to that now.”On the other end, “the Saudis have woken up to the fact that the Russians are eating their lunch”, notes Kilduff.Russian Urals crude is going to Chinese and Indian buyers at around $58-$59 a barrel now versus Brent’s close on Friday at under $79. China is, meanwhile, buying so-called ESPO crude from Siberia at above the G7’s $60 price cap because independent refiners, mainly located in the eastern province of Shandong, are attracted to the oil's short shipping distance and low-sulfur quality, traders said.ESPO crude - shipped on the 4,188km-long Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean pipeline - is oil from fields at Tomsk Oblast and the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug in Western Siberia.Spot discounts for ESPO crude have widened with at least one January-arrival ESPO cargo sold to an independent refiner last week at a discount of around $6.50 per barrel against the March ICE Brent price on a delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters reported, citing two traders with knowledge of the deal.Other cargoes for the same delivery month had traded at around a discount of about $5 a barrel, widening from a discount of $4 in the prior week, the traders said.As most Chinese refiners will soon wrap up purchases of crude to be delivered ahead of the Lunar New Year on Jan. 20, ESPO sellers are also keen to clear cargoes on hand even at slightly lower prices, according to a Shandong-based oil trading source.""Chinese buyers are bidding at lower prices as they now have bigger leverage on price negotiation,"" the person said.The price war deepened in recent days after the Saudis dropped the Official Selling Price on their Arab Light crude, said Kilduff of Again Capital.“The Saudis anticipate that by dropping their price, those who want oil, even on a deferred basis, will lock in now,” said Kilduff. “But if demand for spot crude is weak, it could lead to builds in oil storage - exactly what will encourage the contango to grow.”Kilduff also observed that Russia’s gamble on Ukraine hasn’t gone as Vladimir Putin had expected. “The Ukraine premium in oil now is just about $10 a barrel. A year ago, it was around $30, along with another $30 to $40 in pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. That’s what pushed crude to 14-year highs of between $130 and $140 in early March. Now, we’re trading closer to realistic value.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude registered a final trade of $73.73 per barrel, after officially ending Friday’s session at $73.77, up just 10 cents, or 0.1%.For the week, WTI, as the U.S. crude benchmark is known, was down 8.3%, posting its largest weekly drop since the week ended Dec. 2. The dismal weekly showing came after WTI’s drop of 10% between Tuesday and Wednesday - the worst for any first two days of a trading year in oil since 1991.London-traded Brent crude registered a final trade of $78.60 per barrel, after officially ending Friday’s session at $78.57, down 12 cents, or 0.2%. The global crude benchmark reached as high as $80.56 earlier on Friday. For the week, Brent was down 8.5%.The crude price collapse in the first two days of 2023 came on the back of fresh warnings about a global recession and on fears of China falling into a coronavirus crisis similar to the one it experienced three years ago.Friday’s initial advance in oil, which followed Thursday's rebound, came as moderating U.S. jobs growth signaled more slowing of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Oil: Price OutlookSunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com, noted that WTI finished the week under extreme bearish pressure as prices faced rejection from the $81.50 key resistance zone built around the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average.“Going further, a sustained break below $72 will prompt a quick drop to the horizontal support of $70.”“If this $70 level creates demand, WTI can resume its advance towards the broken-support-turned-resistance zone of the 5-week EMA $77, followed by the 50-Day EMA of 79.50 and extend its rebound toward the 100-week Simple Moving Average of $82.90.”Dixit, however, cautions that if bulls fail to defend the $72&amp;$70 support, “the next bearish wave will lead WTI to reach the 200 week SMA of $65.50.”Natural Gas: Market Settlements and Activity On the natural gas front, prices have tumbled for a third week in a row, forcing America’s premier heating fuel down 17% on the week and more than 50% lower over a three-week period.Gas futures’ benchmark February contact on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.761 per million British thermal units after officially settling Friday’s session at $3.71 per mmBtu. February gas was down 10 cents, or 2.6% on the day. For the week, it was off 76.50 cents, or 17.1%.The tumble came as market participants looked beyond the weekly draw in U.S. gas inventories reported by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, to focus on more unseasonable warmth expected for this winter.Natural Gas: Price OutlookDixit says natural gas could return to above $4, although the chance for a sustained push higher appeared small for now.“As long as prices keep above $3.60, some upward move towards $3.88 followed by a gap area of $4.2 is likely,” he said.“Yet, sustainability below $3.60 may extend the drop to $3.03.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold futures’ benchmark February contract on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,870.50 per ounce after officially ending Friday’s session at $1,869.70. For the day, February gold was up $29.10, or 1.6%.For the week, it rose around 2.4%, rising for a sixth time in seven weeks. Friday’s session peak of $1,870.15 was just shy of Wednesday’s high of $1,871.30 — which was the loftiest level for Comex gold since June 17.The spot price of gold, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,865.97., up $32.92, or 1.8%, on the day. For the week, it rose 2.1%. Spot gold’s intraday peak for Friday was $1,869.88 - also the highest since June 17.Gold: Price Outlook Gold bulls will need to defend the $1,850-$1,830 support areas in order to keep alive the momentum in the yellow metal and test the next level of $1,896.“Spot gold is known to spend a couple of weeks into momentum distribution and accumulation which is mostly perceived as indecision. This often happens before the next leg up begins.”“Substantial buying above the $1,900 line will bring the much-needed $1,940-$1,970 bull targets in closer proximity.”The uptrend will be invalidated by any breakthrough below $1,825, Dixit warns.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesExplainer-Why the U.S.-Mexico energy spat is a tough nut to crackVenezuela owes over $20 million to law firms on guarding overseas assets]"

It conveys the idea of family bonds that encourage people to be responsible for each other.After an all-hands call at Salesforce on Thursday in which Benioff reportedly dodged questions about recently announced layoffs in a rambling, two-hour speech, the appropriateness of that concept came into question.A day earlier, the software giant said it would cut about 10% of its workforce, noting customers were “taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions"" in a ""challenging"" environment.In an email to staff about the thousands of layoffs on Wednesday, Benioff again evoked “Ohana” and the idea of family bonds:“The employees being affected aren’t just colleagues,” he wrote. “They’re friends. They’re family. Please reach out to them. Offer the compassion and love they and their families deserve and need now more than ever. And most of all, please lean on your leadership, including me, as we work through this difficult time together.”But judging by reactions to his speech and the unanswered questions, employees were not feeling the “Ohana.” On an internal Slack channel intended for questions during the meeting, according to Insider, one employee asked:""Given how little of this call has addressed the layoffs, the questions asked in this channel, and the 'family' who were laid off, should we consider retiring the phrase 'Ohana?'""Other posts in the Slack channel reportedly included, ""Is Marc filibustering 47,600+ employees right now by talking in circles and avoiding the topic at hand?” and “I’m sure many of the 10s of thousands of people on this call could be getting things done rather than listening to an unstructured conversation about the business when most people came with very specific questions they hoped would be addressed.""Benioff did seem to briefly refer to the layoffs in his speech, but in a way that likened them to deaths, according to Insider:Story continues""At the kickoff every year, you know, we, um, have a moment where we always say goodbye to everyone who's died during the year,” he said. “And, um, loss is really difficult, and losing folks, and especially losing our trusted colleagues and our managers or employees, it's very similar, uh, in a lot of ways for me. We need to kind of acknowledge that and give ourselves time to mourn and kind of be able to move forward.""A company blog post from 2017 entitled “The Real Meaning Behind 'Salesforce Community'"" states: “In Hawaiian culture, Ohana represents the idea that families—blood-related, adopted, or intentional—are bound together, and that family members are responsible for one another. When [Beniofff] created Salesforce in 1999, he made sure that ‘Ohana’ was in the company’s foundations.”Salesforce did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comments.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: San Francisco being hit with a ‘brutal’ storm so severe that a meteorologist says is ‘one of the most impactful’ he’s ever seenHow will the ultrawealthy ride out the recession? 1,200 investors worth $130 billion have one big strategyBlaming Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the COVID vaccine is ‘wildly and irresponsibly speculative,’ says expertMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$8.1m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Moody's Moody's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Non-Executive Chairman, Raymond McDaniel, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$302 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$290. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Moody's insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Moody's Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Moody's shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of Moody'sAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Moody's insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$110m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Moody's Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Moody's. For example, Moody's has 2 warning signs (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of how political influence shapes the global economy and go directly to 5 Most Politically Influential Countries in the World.A country’s political power over other countries allows it to exert its influence on their policymaking as well as rally them towards common causes. Many countries have their local spheres of political influence. For instance, China, India and Russia hold considerable sway regionally, with the US dominating the global political landscape. Impact of US Political HegemonyGlobalization has been the most important result of US political influence, especially since 1990. It has been the result of US-led trade liberalization, leading to countries opening up their economies for free global trade. Trade openness has grown by 8% for the past 10 years, with 130 countries rising in economic prosperity since 2009. It has been a win-win for the world, with corporations in advanced economies expanding their businesses in developing economies, all the while creating new jobs in the developing world. Not only that, a significant percentage of the workforce in advanced economies are involved in industries whose products and services are exclusively used in other countries. The figure is 10% for the United States and close to 30% for Germany, per the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD also observes that companies in exporting industry also pay higher than average wages than companies in other industries. Further, globalization is also closing the wage gap between advanced and developing economies. Currently, wages for jobs are 2.5 times higher in advanced developed-economies than in advanced developing-economies but owing to factors like trade openness and outsourcing, wages have grown by 8% in advanced developing-region of Asia compared to 1.5% in western countries from 1999-2009, according to Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Story continuesOn the other hand, corporations from advanced countries have grown by an average of 9% for the past decade in emerging economies. The US has the second-highest number of Fortune-500 companies operating globally, at 122 as of 2021. The top 5 corporations with the biggest market caps are all American with the exception of Saudi Aramco. These include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).This allows the country considerable leverage in sanctioning other economies like Russia when they violate international law. For instance, after Russia invaded Ukraine, the majority of US corporations seized their business operations in the country and left, making a significant dent on the Russian economy.The Emerging Political CompetitorPolitical influence largely relies on military and economic power, and other soft-power elements like culture. However, economic power is the strongest predictor of political power, a worldview held by both Marxists and Classical Liberals. In this sense, the US political hegemony is increasingly being challenged by an emerging China, which is the second biggest economy in the world. China’s lightning-fast growth is largely attributed to globalization, when the country opened up to the world in the late 70s. It is set to surpass the US economically by 2030, given no significant externalities, according to organizations like Euler Hermes and Center for Economic and Business Research.This has led to many political pundits suggesting that China will naturally compete with the US to leave its own political imprint on the world. Others, however, believe that China may stick to the classical principle of non-intervention.However, China is increasingly making its presence felt beyond Asia through investments in regions like Africa. Its FDI in Africa increased by 44% between 2014 and 2018, with Nigeria being the top destination for Chinese money, at an inflow of $14.2 billion. Meanwhile, the US investment in the region has dropped by 30%.The increasing rivalry, exacerbated by intellectual-property theft on part of China, is also leading to the US starting a shift of its supply chains from China, which have been the core to its economic growth. The first significant decline in China’s share in US imports came in 2019, with Chinese exports to the latter dropping by 17%, according to RaboBank. The supply chains, for the most part, have been moving to Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan, which gained 20%, 16% and 10%, respectively, from China’s lost share. The process was further accelerated due to extended Covid restrictions in the country that were relaxed in December, 2022. With this backdrop, let’s move down to the 25 most politically influential countries in the world.25 Most Politically Influential Countries in the WorldOur MethodologyFor our list of the 25 most politically influential countries in the world, we’ve ranked them based on the averaged-out scores from two reports -  The Brand Finance’s Global Soft Power Index, 2022 and 2021 CEO-World report of most influential countries. Brand Finance’s report measures countries’ soft power based on metrics like media influence, diplomatic influence and relations, economic strength, innovation and technology companies among various others, with the overall score ranging from 0-100. The CEO-World report, on the other hand, measures countries’ influence based on a global-perception survey carried out with the participation of over 280,000 veterans and experts in fields like economics, international relations, diplomacy and culture. Its scores also range from 0-100. Here are the 25 most politically powerful countries in the world:25. EgyptPolitical-Influence Score: 57.27Egypt is the sixth most advanced country in Africa. It is also the second biggest economy on the continent behind Nigeria. Egypt’s political influence mainly stems from the Suez Canal, which is one of the most important trade routes in the world.24. AustriaPolitical-Influence Score: 58.07Austria is located in the Southern region of Central Europe. It is a member state of the European Union and as such, considered quite influential within the EU. 23. BrazilPolitical-Influence Score: 58.24Brazil is the biggest country in Latin America in terms of the size of the economy, land mass and population. These factors allow the country to wield significant political influence over the region as well as the world. It is an active member of the UN and is also an important BRICS member. 22. TurkeyPolitical-Influence Score: 59.79Turkey is located at the crossroads of Asia and Europe. Being a member of NATO and the G20, Turkey holds considerable sway in world affairs. On top of that, the country’s influence in the Islamic world is also worthy of mention. It has historically been closely engaged with fellow-Muslim countries like Pakistan. 21. DenmarkPolitical-Influence Score: 60.41Denmark is located in the Scandinavian region of Europe. As a member of the European Union and NATO, Denmark plays an important role in shaping policy at the regional and international level. It is also a leader in several important international organizations, such as the United Nations, where it has served on the Security Council and played a role in peacekeeping operations. 20. NorwayPolitical-Influence Score: 61.13Norway is another Scandinavian country on the list. The country’s membership in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Economic Area (EEA) allows it meaningful political influence in Europe. It is also a NATO member and is therefore an important player in global security affairs.19. The NetherlandsPolitical-Influence Score: 61.88The Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe. It is another member of the EU and NATO. It is only behind Germany, France and Italy in terms of its influence in the EU, as determined by ECFR’s EU Coalition Explorer. 18. SwedenPolitical-Influence Score: 62.67Sweden is another Scandinavian country on the list and one of the most politically influential countries in the world in general and in Europe in particular. Like many other countries on the list, Sweden is an EU and NATO member, which enables the country to have significant political capital. 17. United Arab EmiratesPolitical-Influence Score: 64.97The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the most economically powerful countries in the world. It is a member of OPEC and its oil resources make it one of the most politically important countries in the world. OPEC countries’ reduction or increase of oil production is pivotal to the global energy prices. 16. AustraliaPolitical-Influence Score: 65.22Australia is the biggest country in Oceania. The country has global political capital but it is especially influential in the Asia-Pacific amid the rise of China and its regional implications. In this regard, Australia is a party to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD). 15. SpainPolitical-Influence Score: 65.86Spain is another one of the most politically influential countries in the world, largely due to its importance in the EU. The country is located in Southern Europe. 14. Saudi ArabiaPolitical-Influence Score: 66.09Saudi Arabia is the biggest economy in the Middle East and the most powerful member of OPEC, accounting for the biggest share of 34% of the group’s overall oil output. This makes the Kingdom the dominant player in OPEC, in practice. Saudi Arabia’s 11% share in global oil output offers the country great political leverage. Additionally, Saudi Arabia owns $116.5 billion worth of US debt, allowing it financial, and consequently, political leverage over the latter. 13. IndiaPolitical-Influence Score: 66.15India is the sixth largest economy and the second most populous country in the world. The US sees India as an important geopolitical partner in competition against China. However, India, despite its newfound importance with the US, was the pioneer of the non-aligned movement, a strategic position that endures to this day. It has allowed India to craft a friendship with the West while simultaneously being a close Russian partner in military-arms purchases. India, like Brazil, is also a member of BRICS. Additionally, the country is a party to QUAD.India’s economy is also one of the fastest growing in the world, with an expanding middle class, skilled workers and huge demand. It has led to companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) opening up facilities in the country. 12. South KoreaPolitical-Influence Score: 66.69South Korea is located in the Far East. The country is one of the closest security partners with the US, primarily due to its historical dispute with North Korea. It is also a prominent member of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), an organization that promotes trade and cooperation among member states.Speaking of trade, South Korea is highly important in high-tech production. It accounted for 6% of the overall global output in the Knowledge-and-Technology-Intensive (KTI) industries in 2019 and was responsible.11. IsraelPolitical-Influence Score: 66.99Israel is the most technologically advanced country in the Middle East. A less-than-friendly neighborhood, combined with Israel’s own unique geo-military situation, has compelled the country to acquire global political capital to rally the world on its side. Additionally, it is a key non-NATO ally of the US in the region, owing to the US interests in the Middle East and powerful pro-Israel lobbying groups in the US like Christians United for Israel (CUFI) and American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), with the former being the largest one in America. 10. SwitzerlandPolitical-Influence Score: 67.27Switzerland is one of the most politically influential countries in the world, thanks largely to its historic neutrality in world affairs, which allows it to reach across the entire geopolitical landscape diplomatically. In addition, being a member of the World Trade Organization, the country plays an important role in global policy-making.9. ItalyPolitical-Influence Score: 70.65Italy is another Southern European country on the list of the most politically influential countries in the world. The country plays an active role at international institutions such as the UN. 8. CanadaPolitical-Influence Score: 72.76Canada is located in North America and being a G7 economy, it is one of the most politically influential nations in the world. It is also a member of NATO. 7. JapanPolitical-Influence Score: 76.58Japan is another country from the Far East. Apart from being the third biggest economy in the world after the US and China, Japan is also an important US ally. 6. RussiaPolitical-Influence Score: 77.19Russia stretches across Asia and Europe. It is the second-biggest military power in the world, and as such, is politically prominent. Its military might is the remnant of its cold-war legacy, when it was the counterbalancing superpower to the US. After the cold war, countries like Poland and Romania gained independence. However, Russia still has regional influence over countries like Belarus. Russia’s political influence has experienced a dramatic decline following its invasion of Ukraine. However, it still holds considerable global influence through its veto power in the UN and permanent membership. The current Russian war has also led to its economic influence significantly falling, with American corporations like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) closing their operations in the country. Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Politically Influential Countries in the World.

(Photo by Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) - Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesFrontline support from Silicon Valley giants has helped halve the number of Russian cyber attacks on Ukraine, new figures show.Millions of dollars-worth of cyber security help given by Microsoft and Amazon to Kyiv has dramatically reduced the number of cyberattacks by making it harder for Moscow to mount digital offensives.Statistics published by Ukraine’s government show that while the country suffered more than 2,100 separate cyberattacks last year, the frequency per month halved in the months following the outbreak of war.It came as some of the world’s biggest technology companies mobilised to support Kyiv, with Microsoft and Amazon donating around $400m of digital support between them. Big Tech’s help was crucial in helping fend off the worst of the ongoing Russian cyber-assault.Cyber attacks surged as Russian tanks rolled across its eastern borders in February 2022. Kyiv suffered nearly 290 separate assaults in that month alone, as Moscow deployed its digital weaponry alongside traditional firepower.However by August the number had dropped to around 140 attacks per month, according to figures from Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team.A Ukrainian government source said Russia has been targeting “military but civil infrastructure” in a bid to undermine the resolve of Ukrainians.Western governments and private companies alike have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital support, with Amazon and Microsoft alone accounting for around £400m of backing.Microsoft president Brad Smith said that his company’s support for Ukraine’s government amounted to $400m (£333.5m) since the invasion, adding that support during 2023 would be extended “free of charge”.“The continued defence of Ukraine depends in part on a critical digital alliance of countries, companies and nonprofits,” he said in November.Amazon said in December it has committed around $75m (£63m) in support to Ukraine, including providing some of its Snowball devices for copying vital computer files out of Ukrainian data centres, allowing people to move crucial information online.Story continuesJeff Bezos’s company has also helped migrate Ukrainian government operations into its cloud, Amazon Web Services. Mikhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said in December that this support had “made one of the biggest contributions to Ukraine’s victory.”Google has organised charitable donation efforts during 2022 totalling $45m (£37.5m), it said, along with a further $5m raised by the advertising technology company’s employees.The company has also cracked down on Russian propaganda on Google Search as well as in YouTube videos.Russia pioneered the tactic of deploying cyberattacks alongside real-world military aggression, first showcasing this approach in 2008 when it invaded the Georgian province of South Ossetia. Russian hackers successfully targeted digital infrastructure including computer servers belonging to news agencies and government departments in a bid to paralyse Georgia.Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine were both home to groups of organised cyber criminals with links to the Russian government.Industry sources said that some online criminal gangs were co-opted into attacking Ukrainian targets selected by Russian intelligence agencies following Vladimir Putin’s invasion.US cyber security company Mandiant, which is a Google subsidiary, published research last week detailing how Russian hackers from a criminal gang nicknamed Turla had tried to compromise the computer servers of Ukrainian businesses.Booby-trapped USB sticks planted near the buildings of targeted Ukrainian companies were loaded with malware. Hackers hoped curious staff would plug them into computers and unintentionally unleash computer viruses saved on them.John Hultquist, Mandiant’s vice president of threat intelligence, said: “Obviously there's the relationship between state actors and criminals in Russia to consider,” adding that Russian spy agency the FSB had “teamed up with criminals it was supposed to hunt”.Aside from major tech companies, Western governments have also provided crucial behind-the-scenes cyber security support to Ukraine.Whitehall has contributed around £6.5m in cyber support to Ukraine, including specialised antivirus software.Lindy Cameron, chief executive of GCHQ agency the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said when the government revealed the donations: “The NCSC is proud to have played a part in supporting Ukraine’s cyber defenders. They have mounted an impressive defence against Russian aggression in cyberspace, just as they have done on the physical battlefield.”The NCSC is Britain’s cyber security agency, charged with using hackers’ skills to work in defence of Britain and British interests.The US also proffered help. As well as defensive support, US Cyber Command has carried out offensive cyber operations against Russia.General Paul Nakasone told Sky News last summer: “We've conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum; offensive, defensive, [and] information operations.”Ukraine recently rejected a Russian ceasefire proposal timed to coincide with the Russian Orthodox Christmas, with president Volodymyr Zelensky saying the truce was an attempt to stop his country recapturing occupied territory.]"

See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over five years Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings per share dropped significantly, falling to a loss, with the share price also lower. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Walgreens Boots Alliance's TSR for the last 5 years was -42%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders are down 29% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 18%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 7% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Walgreens Boots Alliance better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Walgreens Boots Alliance   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco Sysco Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Sheila Talton, for US$186k worth of shares, at about US$82.14 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$78.71. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Sheila Talton was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Sysco insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$68m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Sysco Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Our analysis of Sysco insider transactions leaves us cautious. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Simon Property Group How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Simon Property Group is:56% = US$2.3b ÷ US$4.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.56 in profit.Does Simon Property Group Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Simon Property Group has a superior ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Simon Property Group by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Simon Property Group's Debt And Its 56% Return On EquityIt seems that Simon Property Group uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 6.10. Its ROE is clearly quite good, but it seems to be boosted by the significant use of debt by the company.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to American International Group's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for American International Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:37% = US$15b ÷ US$41b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.37 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 37% ROEFirst thing first, we like that American International Group has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, American International Group's considerable five year net income growth of 59% was to be expected.We then compared American International Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 13% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AIG? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is American International Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?American International Group's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 11%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 89% of its profits. So it looks like American International Group is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, American International Group has paid dividends over a period of nine years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 28% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 9.9% over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that American International Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

(NYSE:TJX) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-tjx-companies-inc-120055374.html,1673179255,STORY,['TJX'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.22bUS$3.01bUS$3.85bUS$4.56bUS$4.86bUS$5.09bUS$5.28bUS$5.46bUS$5.62bUS$5.77bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 4.69%Est @ 3.88%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.91%Est @ 2.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$2.1kUS$2.6kUS$3.0kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$29bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$43bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$72b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$82.7, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.032. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation.

36,9809d1b6-422d-3140-80e0-5d1ac3d5bed0,NOV,2023-01-08,NOV (NYSE:NOV) Might Have The Makings Of A Multi-Bagger,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nov-nyse-nov-might-makings-124754439.html,1673182074,STORY,['NOV'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, NOV (NYSE:NOV) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NOV is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.019 = US$145m ÷ (US$9.8b - US$2.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, NOV has an ROCE of 1.9%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 7.0%. Check out our latest analysis for NOV roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NOV compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NOV here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIt's great to see that NOV has started to generate some pre-tax earnings from prior investments. While the business is profitable now, it used to be incurring losses on invested capital five years ago. In regards to capital employed, NOV is using 58% less capital than it was five years ago, which on the surface, can indicate that the business has become more efficient at generating these returns. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.What We Can Learn From NOV's ROCEIn the end, NOV has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 43% in the last five years. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching NOV, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

45,2344ffd1-6734-38ea-b2c2-6f905df38499,MDT,2023-01-08,Positive week for Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) institutional investors who lost 21% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-medtronic-plc-nyse-140043253.html,1673100043,STORY,['MDT'],"[Every investor in Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$4.2b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 21% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Medtronic. View our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Medtronic. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Medtronic's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Medtronic is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 4.4% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Medtronic plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$97m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Medtronic. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

""Secondly, it's what our customers are asking for.""Goodyear revealed a new ""demonstration tire"" at CES comprised of 90% sustainable material content. It was just in January 2022 that the company unveiled a 70% sustainable material tire.A NASCAR crew member performs work on Goodyear Racing Eagle tires at Texas Motor Speedway on September 25, 2022 in Fort Worth. (Photo: Michael C. Johnson-USA TODAY Sports)The latest iteration is composed of ""ingredients"" like soybean oil and rice husk waste.""As we look at soybean oil, it makes a tire more pliable in cold conditions and that gives it more grip,"" Kramer explained. ""And on rice husk ash, we use it in place of petro-based silica. And what that does for us is actually improves rolling resistance on the tread. So this is a way of actually moving to those bio-based materials and not giving up any performance, and in fact, in many cases, enhancing performance.""According to Kramer, Goodyear remains on track to release a tire made from 100% sustainable materials by 2030.'Input costs have gone up so dramatically'The company's latest innovation push comes amid several challenging quarters as global economies slow, inflation remains stubbornly high, and consumers push back on price hikes.In late October 2022, Goodyear revealed third-quarter tire unit volumes fell 3% from the prior fiscal quarter. Replacement tire volume dropped 9%, under-performing a 3.5% decline for the overall industry. Adjusted net income declined 43% year on year to $116 million, while earnings came in shy of analyst estimates.The company predicted many of the ""underlying"" trends it saw in its business for the third quarter would continue into the fourth quarter.Story continuesGoodyear shares lost about 53% in 2022.Kramer shared that inflation remains a headwind for Goodyear, but maintained that he isn't seeing consumers push back too hard at inflation-based price increases.""We look very closely at tread wear as we take tires off as they get replaced,"" he said. ""And I would tell you, we're not seeing tread wear going down to levels beyond what is normal. And that tells me that consumers are still in the mode of changing tires at a normal cycle. That's a really good thing. And yes, tire pricing has gone up, but that's also because as we said earlier, those input costs have gone up so dramatically.""Wall Street, nonetheless, looks to be taking a wait-and-see approach on Goodyear before becoming more constructive on the stock.""While Goodyear continues to impress in its ability to generate price/mix gains in excess of tire raw materials inflation — and this is significantly differentiated versus its last experience with rising commodity costs over the 2017-2019 timeframe — the higher-than-expected general inflationary backdrop (impacting many areas of its business, including freight, labor, and, perhaps most notably, energy costs such as electricity and natural gas, particularly in Europe) has proven more difficult to offset via price increases,"" JP Morgan Analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.—Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Is Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $17.76, but it is currently trading at US$10.97 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -14% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although GT is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to GT, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GT for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.If you'd like to know more about Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

48,0c6657a7-859f-3e59-815a-abf27ccb1264,MOS,2023-01-08,The 7 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-fertilizer-stocks-buy-171118672.html,1672852278,STORY,"['FMC', 'AVD', 'MOS', 'CF', 'NTR', 'UAN', 'CTVA']","[The best fertilizer stocks to buy shot up the charts last year, albeit for astoundingly horrific reasons. As the world’s top fertilizer exporter, Russia played an integral role in the broader food supply chain. However, when it decided to exercise its imperialistic ambitions by invading Ukraine, the crisis effectively blackmailed the planet.To maintain the modern world order of eschewing violence for diplomacy (except for certain extreme conditions), the free world couldn’t just let the Russians do what they pleased. Predictably, then, following several rounds of punitive economic sanctions, Moscow retaliated with its own export bans. While the Kremlin did not explicitly ban fertilizers, it gradually restricted the commodity’s transportation.Of course, because the underlying compost represents a critical cog in the food production value chain, agriculture garnered tremendous interest. In particular, investors may be able to bank on the best fertilizer stocks to buy for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMOSMosaic$42.77NTRNutrien$72.08CFCF Industries$81.74UANCVR Partners$104.43CTVACorteva$59.33FMCFMC Corp.$123.70AVDAmerican Vanguard$21.66Mosaic (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBased in Tampa, Florida, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) mines phosphate and potash. Additionally, the company collects urea for fertilizer through various international distribution networks. Per its public profile, Mosaic’s claim to fame among the best fertilizer stocks to buy is that it represents the largest U.S. producer of potash and phosphate fertilizer. In 2022, MOS gained a bit over 9% of equity value.At the moment, Gurufocus.com notes that Mosaic features eight positive signs with no yellow or red flags. As I mentioned in prior articles, that’s a rare status. Typically, even industry leaders will carry some weakness or vulnerability. Fundamentally, MOS attracts bullish investors for its cheap valuation, passive income trek, and stability in the balance sheet.Story continuesTo emphasize, Mosaic represents an objectively undervalued market idea. For instance, the market prices MOS shares at 4.6 times forward earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 5.82 times. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg Mosaic as a consensus moderate buy. Perhaps most impressively, they target a price of $65, above 48% from its end-of-2022 price.Nutrien (NTR)A photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.comOperating out of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Nutrien (NYSE:NTR) represents a Canadian fertilizer company. Notably, Nutrien is the largest producer of potash and the third-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world. Per its corporate profile, the enterprise features over 2,000 retail locations across North America, South America, and Australia with more than 23,500 employees. In 2022, NTR lost 4% of its market value.Financially, Nutrien enjoys a similar profile to Mosaic. Like its sector rival, Nutrien commands an objectively undervalued business. Currently, the market prices NTR at 5.5 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 13.4 times. As well, the company’s price-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.2 times, below the sector median of 0.84 times.To be fair, Nutrien doesn’t own the most stable balance sheet. However, it makes for this shortfall with a solid growth picture. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 13.7%, above the sector median of 7.65%. Finally, covering analysts peg NTR as a consensus moderate buy with a $101.13 price target (up 38.5%). Thus, it ranks among the best fertilizer stocks to buy.CF Industries (CF)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA major player among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) calls Deerfield, Illinois home. The company is a manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products. Thanks to the relevance of the underlying industry, CF generated strong returns for investors, moving up nearly 21% last year.As with other ideas listed among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, CF Industries benefits from an objectively cheap profile. Presently, Wall Street prices CF at 5.6 times trailing earnings. As mentioned above, the sector median is 13.4 times. As well, CF pips Nutrien with a slightly lower PEG ratio at 0.18 times. This stat rates favorably lower than over 89% of industry players.Still, not everyone looks at the company with rose-tinted glasses. As of this writing, TipRanks notes that CF carries a consensus analyst view of hold. However, the consensus price target stands at $114.25. Based on CF’s close at the end of last year, investors may be looking at a 34% upside potential.CVR Partners (UAN)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) manufactures and provides nitrogen fertilizer products. When the dust settled in 2022, CVR carried a market capitalization of just over $1 billion. For the year, UAN ended up gaining over 18% of equity value, making it one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.Again, similar to its peers, CVR enjoys an objectively undervalued business. Presently, Wall Street prices shares at 4.2 times trailing earnings. This stat ranks favorably below over 91% of companies in the agricultural industry. In addition, CVR commands a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 3.25 times. This compares very favorably to the sector median value of 11.8 times.To be clear, CVR’s balance sheet ranks as middling, meaning it could use some work. However, investors will be pleased that its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 17.2%, beating out nearly 75% of its rivals. Finally, its return on equity of almost 70% reflects a vastly superior capacity to convert equity financing into profits. Thus, UAN makes for a strong overall case as one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.Corteva (CTVA)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comOne of the trickier names among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) originally represented the agricultural unit of DuPont (NYSE:DD) prior to its spin-off as an independent company. Primarily, Corteva focuses on chemicals and seeds. However, it also launched a new above-ground nitrogen stabilizer one day prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Make of that what you will.Now, the challenge for prospective investors of CTVA is whether to pursue the stock’s momentum. In 2022, Corteva gained over 25% of its equity value. On paper, this performance makes CTVA one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy. That said, the company takes a step away from its peers, ranking as objectively overvalued. For instance, the market prices CTVA at 19 times forward earnings and 31.4 times trailing earnings.However, the enterprise carries decent stability in the balance sheet, particularly an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.61 times. This ranks better than over 66% of the competition. Also, covering analysts rate the shares as a consensus strong buy.FMC Corp (FMC)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, FMC Corp (NYSE:FMC) is a chemical manufacturing company that originated as an insecticide producer. Currently, the company offers solutions for various industries, including biofertilizers which help farmers improve their crops’ resilience to drought. At the end of last year, FMC carried a market cap of $15.6 billion. In 2022, it returned 13.3% of equity value for stakeholders.Similar to Corteva, FMC doesn’t exactly own an undervalued business. At best, based on Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, FMC is exactly that – fairly valued. However, the enterprise makes up for this miss with solid profitability metrics. For example, the company’s net margin stands at 11.6%, above almost 71% of the industry.In addition, analysts overall remain bullish on FMC’s prospects, rating it a consensus moderate buy. Also, one important consideration is that hedge funds have been gradually building their position in FMC since the first quarter of last year. With the smart money moving in, FMC may very well be one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.American Vanguard (AVD)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comFor those that want to take a potshot among the best fertilizer stocks to buy, American Vanguard (NYSE:AVD) may offer an interesting opportunity. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, American Vanguard produces agrochemicals and pesticide delivery systems. As well, under its Agrinos business unit, AVD develops liquid fertilizers for plant nutrition. In 2022, AVD gained a remarkably robust 33.9%.Of course, with such strong performances, there are two ways to assess the underlying investment. On the pessimistic side, it’s possible that AVD could be due for a correction. After all, fears of a global recession dominated last year’s business headlines. Still, on the optimistic front, AVD could carry momentum into this year and perhaps beyond.As a relatively small player (featuring a market cap of only $642 million), no analyst presently covers AVD. Nevertheless, this framework could change soon enough. That’s because in the past three earnings reports, the company beat per-share profitability expectations. Therefore, AVD could be one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy for risk-tolerant investors.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:PFE) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 2.5% on the 3rd of March to $0.41, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.40. This takes the dividend yield to 3.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. View our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Pfizer was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 36.5% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 50%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.88 total annually to $1.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.2% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Pfizer has been growing its earnings per share at 27% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Pfizer Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Past rounds have seen drugmakers cut prices by as much as 62% after negotiations with officials.""We will continue to collaborate with the Chinese government and all relevant stakeholders to secure an adequate supply of Paxlovid in China. We remain committed to fulfilling the COVID-19 treatment needs of Chinese patients,"" Pfizer said in a statement, without elaborating.The NHSA said Paxlovid would continue to be eligible to be paid for by state medical insurance until the current planned end-date to the temporary measures of March 31.While the talks on Paxlovid failed, they succeeded with two other COVID-19 treatment drugs -- herbal medication Qingfei Paidu granules and Chinese drugmaker Genuine Biotech's Azvudine -- which will be included in the list's update, the regulator said.Three years into the pandemic, China began pivoting away from its signature ""zero COVID"" policy last month after historic protests against the economically-damaging curbs that had been championed by President Xi Jinping.The sudden loosening of restrictions has fueled a giant wave of infections and prompted many to turn to underground channels to procure remedies such as Paxlovid, which a clinical trial has found to have reduced hospitalisations in high-risk patients by around 90%.Story continuesBoxes of Paxlovid are changing hands for as much as 50,000 yuan ($7,313.15), more than 20 times the original price of 2,300 yuan, according to local media reports and social media posts.Beijing has been largely resistant to Western vaccines, but has greenlighted foreign oral treatments Paxlovid and Merck's Molnupiravir. It approved Paxlovid in February.Reuters reported on Saturday, citing sources, that China is in talks with Pfizer to secure a licence that will allow domestic drugmakers to manufacture and distribute a generic version of Paxlovid.Last month, China Meheco Group Co Ltd said on Wednesday it signed an agreement with Pfizer to import and distribute Paxlovid in mainland China.Pfizer also signed a deal in August for Chinese drugmaker Zhejiang Huahai to produce Paxlovid in mainland China solely for patients there.

(NYSE:PNC) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase PNC Financial Services Group's shares before the 13th of January to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of February.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.50 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, PNC Financial Services Group has a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current stock price of $164.21. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether PNC Financial Services Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. PNC Financial Services Group paid out a comfortable 42% of its profit last year.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see PNC Financial Services Group's earnings per share have risen 13% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, PNC Financial Services Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs PNC Financial Services Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Companies like PNC Financial Services Group that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. In summary, PNC Financial Services Group appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks PNC Financial Services Group is facing.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) share price is up 94% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 34% (ignoring dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Intuitive Surgical managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.8% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 69.34.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Intuitive Surgical's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Intuitive Surgical shareholders can take comfort that their trailing twelve month loss of 17% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 18%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. Is Intuitive Surgical cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Story continuesBut note: Intuitive Surgical may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession. Investment advisory Barclays forecasts that 2023 will be one of the worst years for the global economy in forty years. Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession). Similarly, investors prefer to solidify their portfolios with recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In).

With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”13. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

(NASDAQ:ORLY) operates as a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States.

O’Reilly Automotive continues to grow its store base and has recently announced an expansion into Mexico. The company operates in an industry where competition has historically remained rational through the economic cycle.”10.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT), compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Verizon Communications is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.083 = US$27b ÷ (US$375b - US$53b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 8.3%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 8.0%. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceIn the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Verizon Communications Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Verizon Communications doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 8.3% from 13% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 1.1% to shareholders over the last five years. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Verizon Communications that you might find interesting.While Verizon Communications isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

66,a37da89d-90b9-35ac-9c2e-6bc65eeec4be,NVDA,2023-01-08,NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporations-nasdaq-nvda-stocks-120024442.html,1673179224,STORY,['NVDA'],"[NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up by a considerable 27% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to NVIDIA's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:28% = US$6.0b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 28% ROEFirst thing first, we like that NVIDIA has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 19% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, NVIDIA's considerable five year net income growth of 23% was to be expected.As a next step, we compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 29% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is NVIDIA Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?NVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1%, meaning that it has the remaining 93% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 2.6% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 53%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of McKesson, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McKesson?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in McKesson. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McKesson, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. McKesson is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McKessonWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McKesson Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$48m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McKesson. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McKesson better, we need to consider many other factors.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Exelon, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Exelon ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Exelon?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Exelon. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Exelon's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Exelon. The company's largest shareholder is Wellington Management Group LLP, with ownership of 9.2%. With 9.1% and 7.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ExelonThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Exelon Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$44m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Exelon. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

(NYSE:UAA) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Under Armour’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Under Armour What Is Under Armour Worth?According to my valuation model, Under Armour seems to be fairly priced at around 13.31% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Under Armour today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $9.49, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Under Armour’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Under Armour?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Under Armour's revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UAA’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAA, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Under Armour, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in Under Armour, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:PRU) share price has gained 11% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 19% in that half decade.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial While Prudential Financial made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.In the last half decade, Prudential Financial saw its revenue increase by 1.6% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. Given this fairly low revenue growth (and lack of profits), it's not particularly surprising to see the stock down 3% (annualized) in the same time frame. Investors should consider how bad the losses are, and whether the company can make it to profitability with ease. It could be worth putting it on your watchlist and revisiting when it makes its maiden profit.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPrudential Financial is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Prudential Financial the TSR over the last 5 years was 2.9%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Prudential Financial shares lost 7.9% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 18%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 0.6% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Prudential Financial is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession. Investment advisory Barclays forecasts that 2023 will be one of the worst years for the global economy in forty years. Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession). Similarly, investors prefer to solidify their portfolios with recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In). Some of the best recession stocks to buy for 2023 include Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Story continuesOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 14 stocks that are recession proof. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like alcohol, consumer staples, healthcare, and finance. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 RecessionPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashBest Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession14.

Alcohol demand surges during recessions, making Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) one of the best stocks to buy before a recession hits in 2023. Consumer demand for Diageo products remains resilient worldwide.

With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”13. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) develops, manufactures, and sells healthcare products worldwide.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best stocks for a recession-proof portfolio given its defensive nature. On January 5, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022.

(NYSE:WMT), compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q3 2022 increased to $4 billion from $3.78 billion in Q2 2022. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

80,13635621-6aa2-3042-9687-fc1c8be8868d,MCD,2023-01-08,Jim Cramer’s Recession-Proof Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-recession-proof-stock-184341395.html,1673117381,STORY,"['^DJI', 'CVX', 'KO', 'AAPL', 'PG', 'AXP', 'CAT', 'MCD']","[In this article, we discuss Jim Cramer's recession-proof stock picks. To skip to the top four stocks in this list, go to Jim Cramer's Top 4 Recession-Proof Stock Picks.Warning bells for recession started ringing in 2022 and they haven’t stopped since. As if investors weren’t already spooked enough, a fresh warning comes straight from the horse’s mouth. On January 2, IMF’s head Kristalina Georgieva warned the world that 2023 would be tougher than the previous year because the three major economies of the world — the US, the EU and China — are slowing down simultaneously. The head of the IMF believes that in 2023, one-third of the world economy would be in recession.“Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,” Georgieva added.She also said that China’s economic growth will be equal to or below the global economic growth for the first time in 40 years. Over the past few decades, China has been posting record economic growth and has stunned the world with its economic performance. However, the coronavirus outbreak, real estate crisis and severe regulatory pressures spooking the technology companies in the country have wreaked havoc on the country’s growth trajectory.IMF’s chief also said that the US economy looks strong and it could avoid recession. She said the labor market in the country remains strong. However, this strong labor market is something that could bring more pain for investors in the months to come.“This is … a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,” Georgieva said.Major investment firms and economic institutions are now joining the recession chorus. According to Bloomberg, Barclays Capital believes 2023 would be the worst year for the world economy in four decades, while Ned Davis Research Inc. thinks there’s a 65% chance of a worldwide economic downturn. Fidelity International thinks we are headed for a hard landing.Story continuesInflation Expected to Slow DownA latest report from the Dutch financial services firm ING said that inflation might start to come down in the US and there are chances that the Federal Reserve will start decreasing interest rates before eventually halting the hikes. However, the report said that inflation in Europe would take some time to recede.An Unexpected Positive DevelopmentThere’s at least one positive news lately: an unexpected late start to the winter season is keeping natural gas prices low, calming investors around the world who were expecting a major energy crunch during the start of the winter.Jim Cramer's Playbook for RecessionJim Cramer has a huge following online and hundreds of thousands of people listen to his commentary of the US and global stock market and economic situation. In November last year, Jim Cramer shared his playbook for inflation in a program and talked frankly about his strategy to survive through a recession. Cramer said that the Federal Reserve’s chair Jerome Powell doesn’t like inflation at all and he wants investors’ stock portfolios to go down.Cramer said that the Fed is not expected to stop rate hikes anytime soon, which means you should keep selling tech stocks and flock to defensive stocks in sectors like oil, banks, healthcare and consumer products. Cramer said that stocks in these sectors can go up despite inflation because companies in these sectors are more “conservative.”Jim Cramer then talked about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and said that the index is full of relatively cheap stocks. He said that some believe the 30 companies in the Dow are vulnerable to recession. But Cramer believes “that’s just not true, that’s wrong.” Cramer thinks the Dow companies can handle recessions pretty well and recommended investors to pick stocks from the index to prepare for a recession.Our MethodologyIn this article, we picked stocks that are recession-proof based on the investment philosophy of Jim Cramer we talked about above. Cramer is bullish on these stocks, and we have mentioned his thesis for each of these stocks.Jim Cramer's Recession0Proof Stock Picks11. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) makes it to our list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks because the company is part of the Dow Jones index, which Cramer believes you should look for if you want to find recession-proof stocks, as mentioned in the introduction of this article. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is on Jim Cramer radar for quite some time now. In October 2022, Jim Cramer expressed his surprise when American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock tanked after earnings. He said at that time that American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock was a buy and praised the company for hiking its dividend in January. He also said that the company is set to profit as consumers increase travel.A total of 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of the third quarter of 2022.10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Jim Cramer loves Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has been recommending the stock publicly as well as to his investing club. In October, Jim Cramer said that “Apple is at the root of everything” and the stock’s decline has become synonymous with the decline of the entire market. That proved to be true as the stock market ended lower on the first day of 2023, mainly due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s slump. Cramer also said in the same program that Apple is the “greatest stock of all time.”Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a key part of the Dow Jones index, and the company also pays a dividend. These two factors make Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a recession-proof stock, according to Jim Cramer.Hedge funds seem to agree with Cramer. At the end of the third quarter, 140 hedge funds reported having stakes in Apple, compared to 128 funds in the previous quarter. This shows a sharp increase in hedge fund sentiment around Apple shares.9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)As we mentioned in the introduction of this article, Jim Cramer recommends oil stocks to prepare for the upcoming recession. Since Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most important oil stock in the Dow Jones index, we added it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks. Jim Cramer has been a fan of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) for a long time. In April last year, Jim Cramer praised Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s dividend yield and buybacks and said that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most attractive of the large cap stocks in the market.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an ideal stock for recessions. The company has been increasing its dividend for 35 years now. In the third quarter, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) easily crushed analyst estimates and its net income came in at $11.23 billion. Revenue in the period jumped 49%.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)In July last year, Jim Cramer discussed in detail why he thinks The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a suitable stock pick for recessions. Jim Cramer said that in recessions you should hide behind defensive, recession-proof stocks, and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a “textbook” example of such stocks. Cramer said that the beverage business is not a hostage to the economy, by which he means that the business continues to thrive irrespective of the economic conditions since people continue to consume basic beverages like Coca Cola.Cramer said that the economic slowdown could cause a slump in prices of commodities like aluminum and sugar, which would help The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offset the losses it might face due to rising inflation.Recently, UBS analyst Peter Grom and his team said in a note that consumer staples were clear winners in 2022 and they believe many stocks in the group are expected to outperform the market again in 2023. The firm’s analysts are bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), in addition to many other consumer companies.7. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) made it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks due to obvious reasons. The company is a solid dividend payer, it has loads of cash and it is operating in a segment which is not directly affected by recessions. Last month, Jim Cramer recommended McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and said that it is a classic defensive stock that typically continues performing well during tough economic times.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been increasing its dividend for the last 28 consecutive years.A total of 53 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 920 funds reported having stakes in McDonald’s at the end of the September quarter, compared to 50 funds in the previous quarter.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)In October, in a lightning round in his program, Jim Cramer said that he prefer The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) over Walmart. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also a key part of the Dow Jones index, which is the favorite index of Cramer to find stocks for a recession. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best stocks to buy during difficult times since the company has upped its dividend for 66 years in a row. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.41% as of January 3.A total of 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of the third quarter.5. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Jim Cramer was extremely bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) last month as he spoke about the company in a program at CNBC. Cramer said that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the great industrial companies. He said people are “ignoring” Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) and the stock is undervalued. He also thinks that President Biden’s infrastructure plan would help the company.What makes Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) a recession-proof stock is its steady dividend and recession-proof business dynamics. The Down Jones component company has been increasing its dividends consistently for the past 28 years. The demand for its construction equipment keeps rising as the government and private sector initiates more construction projects.In the next part of the article we will discuss the remaining four stocks in this list.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 31% over five years, which is below the market return. But if you include dividends then the return is market-beating. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 7.4%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for PACCAR While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, PACCAR achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PACCAR has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for PACCAR the TSR over the last 5 years was 60%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that PACCAR has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 12% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

84,13635621-6aa2-3042-9687-fc1c8be8868d,AXP,2023-01-08,Jim Cramer’s Recession-Proof Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-recession-proof-stock-184341395.html,1673117381,STORY,"['^DJI', 'CVX', 'KO', 'AAPL', 'PG', 'AXP', 'CAT', 'MCD']","[In this article, we discuss Jim Cramer's recession-proof stock picks. To skip to the top four stocks in this list, go to Jim Cramer's Top 4 Recession-Proof Stock Picks.Warning bells for recession started ringing in 2022 and they haven’t stopped since. As if investors weren’t already spooked enough, a fresh warning comes straight from the horse’s mouth. On January 2, IMF’s head Kristalina Georgieva warned the world that 2023 would be tougher than the previous year because the three major economies of the world — the US, the EU and China — are slowing down simultaneously. The head of the IMF believes that in 2023, one-third of the world economy would be in recession.“Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,” Georgieva added.She also said that China’s economic growth will be equal to or below the global economic growth for the first time in 40 years. Over the past few decades, China has been posting record economic growth and has stunned the world with its economic performance. However, the coronavirus outbreak, real estate crisis and severe regulatory pressures spooking the technology companies in the country have wreaked havoc on the country’s growth trajectory.IMF’s chief also said that the US economy looks strong and it could avoid recession. She said the labor market in the country remains strong. However, this strong labor market is something that could bring more pain for investors in the months to come.“This is … a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,” Georgieva said.Major investment firms and economic institutions are now joining the recession chorus. According to Bloomberg, Barclays Capital believes 2023 would be the worst year for the world economy in four decades, while Ned Davis Research Inc. thinks there’s a 65% chance of a worldwide economic downturn. Fidelity International thinks we are headed for a hard landing.Story continuesInflation Expected to Slow DownA latest report from the Dutch financial services firm ING said that inflation might start to come down in the US and there are chances that the Federal Reserve will start decreasing interest rates before eventually halting the hikes. However, the report said that inflation in Europe would take some time to recede.An Unexpected Positive DevelopmentThere’s at least one positive news lately: an unexpected late start to the winter season is keeping natural gas prices low, calming investors around the world who were expecting a major energy crunch during the start of the winter.Jim Cramer's Playbook for RecessionJim Cramer has a huge following online and hundreds of thousands of people listen to his commentary of the US and global stock market and economic situation. In November last year, Jim Cramer shared his playbook for inflation in a program and talked frankly about his strategy to survive through a recession. Cramer said that the Federal Reserve’s chair Jerome Powell doesn’t like inflation at all and he wants investors’ stock portfolios to go down.Cramer said that the Fed is not expected to stop rate hikes anytime soon, which means you should keep selling tech stocks and flock to defensive stocks in sectors like oil, banks, healthcare and consumer products. Cramer said that stocks in these sectors can go up despite inflation because companies in these sectors are more “conservative.”Jim Cramer then talked about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and said that the index is full of relatively cheap stocks. He said that some believe the 30 companies in the Dow are vulnerable to recession. But Cramer believes “that’s just not true, that’s wrong.” Cramer thinks the Dow companies can handle recessions pretty well and recommended investors to pick stocks from the index to prepare for a recession.Our MethodologyIn this article, we picked stocks that are recession-proof based on the investment philosophy of Jim Cramer we talked about above. Cramer is bullish on these stocks, and we have mentioned his thesis for each of these stocks.Jim Cramer's Recession0Proof Stock Picks11. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) makes it to our list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks because the company is part of the Dow Jones index, which Cramer believes you should look for if you want to find recession-proof stocks, as mentioned in the introduction of this article. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is on Jim Cramer radar for quite some time now. In October 2022, Jim Cramer expressed his surprise when American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock tanked after earnings. He said at that time that American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock was a buy and praised the company for hiking its dividend in January. He also said that the company is set to profit as consumers increase travel.A total of 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of the third quarter of 2022.10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Jim Cramer loves Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has been recommending the stock publicly as well as to his investing club. In October, Jim Cramer said that “Apple is at the root of everything” and the stock’s decline has become synonymous with the decline of the entire market. That proved to be true as the stock market ended lower on the first day of 2023, mainly due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s slump. Cramer also said in the same program that Apple is the “greatest stock of all time.”Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a key part of the Dow Jones index, and the company also pays a dividend. These two factors make Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a recession-proof stock, according to Jim Cramer.Hedge funds seem to agree with Cramer. At the end of the third quarter, 140 hedge funds reported having stakes in Apple, compared to 128 funds in the previous quarter. This shows a sharp increase in hedge fund sentiment around Apple shares.9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)As we mentioned in the introduction of this article, Jim Cramer recommends oil stocks to prepare for the upcoming recession. Since Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most important oil stock in the Dow Jones index, we added it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks. Jim Cramer has been a fan of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) for a long time. In April last year, Jim Cramer praised Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s dividend yield and buybacks and said that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most attractive of the large cap stocks in the market.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an ideal stock for recessions. The company has been increasing its dividend for 35 years now. In the third quarter, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) easily crushed analyst estimates and its net income came in at $11.23 billion. Revenue in the period jumped 49%.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)In July last year, Jim Cramer discussed in detail why he thinks The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a suitable stock pick for recessions. Jim Cramer said that in recessions you should hide behind defensive, recession-proof stocks, and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a “textbook” example of such stocks. Cramer said that the beverage business is not a hostage to the economy, by which he means that the business continues to thrive irrespective of the economic conditions since people continue to consume basic beverages like Coca Cola.Cramer said that the economic slowdown could cause a slump in prices of commodities like aluminum and sugar, which would help The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offset the losses it might face due to rising inflation.Recently, UBS analyst Peter Grom and his team said in a note that consumer staples were clear winners in 2022 and they believe many stocks in the group are expected to outperform the market again in 2023. The firm’s analysts are bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), in addition to many other consumer companies.7. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) made it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks due to obvious reasons. The company is a solid dividend payer, it has loads of cash and it is operating in a segment which is not directly affected by recessions. Last month, Jim Cramer recommended McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and said that it is a classic defensive stock that typically continues performing well during tough economic times.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been increasing its dividend for the last 28 consecutive years.A total of 53 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 920 funds reported having stakes in McDonald’s at the end of the September quarter, compared to 50 funds in the previous quarter.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)In October, in a lightning round in his program, Jim Cramer said that he prefer The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) over Walmart. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also a key part of the Dow Jones index, which is the favorite index of Cramer to find stocks for a recession. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best stocks to buy during difficult times since the company has upped its dividend for 66 years in a row. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.41% as of January 3.A total of 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of the third quarter.5. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Jim Cramer was extremely bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) last month as he spoke about the company in a program at CNBC. Cramer said that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the great industrial companies. He said people are “ignoring” Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) and the stock is undervalued. He also thinks that President Biden’s infrastructure plan would help the company.What makes Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) a recession-proof stock is its steady dividend and recession-proof business dynamics. The Down Jones component company has been increasing its dividends consistently for the past 28 years. The demand for its construction equipment keeps rising as the government and private sector initiates more construction projects.In the next part of the article we will discuss the remaining four stocks in this list. All these stocks belong to the healthcare sector. These stocks were recommended by Jim Cramer in a recent program, in which he said that healthcare stocks remained steady in 2022 because they “tend to be recession-resistant stocks.” Let’s find out more. Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's Top 4 Recession-Proof Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:12 Best Performing Growth Stocks in 2022Ken Fisher's Growth Stocks25 Largest Nordic Companies Disclosure.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Mondelez International's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:12% = US$3.1b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Mondelez International's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Mondelez International's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 14%. This probably goes some way in explaining Mondelez International's moderate 6.7% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Mondelez International's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 7.0% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MDLZ worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MDLZ is currently mispriced by the market.Is Mondelez International Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Mondelez International has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 45% (or a retention ratio of 55%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Moreover, Mondelez International is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 51% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Mondelez International is predicted to rise to 17% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Mondelez International's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession. Investment advisory Barclays forecasts that 2023 will be one of the worst years for the global economy in forty years. Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession). Similarly, investors prefer to solidify their portfolios with recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In). Some of the best recession stocks to buy for 2023 include Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Story continuesOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 14 stocks that are recession proof. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like alcohol, consumer staples, healthcare, and finance. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 RecessionPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashBest Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession14. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a London-based company that produces, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages under the Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal, Don Julio, Ciroc, Buchanan's, Casamigos, J&amp;B, and Ketel One brands. Alcohol demand surges during recessions, making Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) one of the best stocks to buy before a recession hits in 2023. Consumer demand for Diageo products remains resilient worldwide. Although earnings had been fluctuant in the past, they always rebounded well, and will potentially be solid in the coming economic downturn.On January 4, Credit Suisse analyst Sanjeet Aujla raised the price target on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) to 4,500 GBp from 4,400 GBp and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 20 hedge funds held stakes worth $527.4 million in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 22 funds in the prior quarter worth $887.3 million. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.35 million shares worth $229.2 million. Like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is one of the best recession stocks to invest in. Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”13. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based company that develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products. It operates through three segments – Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and Specialty Products Division. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

The company has a history of 27 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it a reliable income stock to pick up for the volatile market environment. On December 6, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers raised the firm's price target on Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) to $90 from $85 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) was part of 40 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 32 in the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 8.45 million shares worth $604.2 million. Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) declined 22.7% after reporting first quarter operating results that were below expectations. The company also lowered guidance on macroeconomic concerns, with management citing softness across their product portfolio, especially for their discretionary categories, as retailers work on reducing inventory levels.”12. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) is a California-based company that sells discount retail apparel and home fashion accessories under the Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS brand names. It is one of the best stocks to buy for the 2023 recession, as customers tend to gravitate towards off-price stores during difficult times. As of December 19, Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) continues to be seen as a retail sector winner amid the holiday season and continuing inflationary headwinds.On November 21, Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih raised the price target on Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) to $127 from $98 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares. The company's Q3 earnings report ""was the second proof point that the balance of power has shifted in Off-Price's favor,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 46 funds in the prior quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 3.95 million shares worth $333 million. Carillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) topped the contribution list as this discount clothing and accessories retailer rebounded from oversold conditions after reporting a weak quarter. Ross continues to follow its deep discount strategy, offering consumers bargains on clothing as it executes a “packaway” inventory strategy, scooping up inventory when its buyers perceive bargains in the marketplace, then passing savings on to customers with low-cost retail locations.”11. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) operates as a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States. For full-year 2022, the company expects revenue to be between $14.1 billion and $14.3 billion, versus a consensus of $14.16 billion and GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $32.35 to $32.85, compared to the prior view of $31.25 to $31.75 and a consensus of $31.86. During recessions, customers tend to fix their old vehicles instead of purchasing new ones, which skyrockets demand for companies like O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY). On January 5, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem raised the price target on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) to $925 from $850 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. Despite industry-leading comps and positive share gains, the analyst believes a case can be made that O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) under-earned in 2022 and in 2023, he sees the benefits of a solid, needs-based category, little evidence of pricing roll back, and potential tailwinds from share gains and improving margins. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), compared to 41 funds in the last quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.47 million shares worth $1 billion. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) outperformed the Consumer Discretionary sector because its business is expected to be more resilient in an economic downturn. The company’s second quarter earnings were slightly below consensus estimates; however, the outlook for the rest of the year showed steady growth despite difficult comparisons with the second half of 2021. O’Reilly Automotive continues to grow its store base and has recently announced an expansion into Mexico. The company operates in an industry where competition has historically remained rational through the economic cycle.”10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the best stocks to buy for the 2023 recession, as demand for cheap food surges during periods of economic volatility and high unemployment. On December 15, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and five of its suppliers signed a deal to purchase almost 190 megawatts of power from Blue Jay Solar Farm.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) will announce its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in. Income stocks are a good hedge against market volatility, as dividends help a portfolio that suffers from share price losses. The company has increased its exposure to alcoholic beverages over the last two years as well. On December 20, Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said he expects a more challenging backdrop for the global consumer in FY23 as input costs remain high and companies will be looking to raise prices in some cases. In this context, his top names in beverages include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), where he sees category momentum, continuous investment, and solid execution driving growth. The analyst has an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares with a $69 price target. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 59 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 60 funds in the last quarter.

Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) develops, manufactures, and sells healthcare products worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.

The macro backdrop remains constrained for medical supplies and devices, but the analyst is ""generally constructive"" on the sector, seeing improving volume trends, solid labor challenges, and ""potentially stabilizing"" supply chain and inflationary cost trends. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was part of 62 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 61 in the preceding quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best stocks for a recession-proof portfolio given its defensive nature. On January 5, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022. The company completed more than 6,000 deliveries via drone during the year from its 36 drone delivery hubs across seven states. As of the end of 2022, locations in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia provided drone delivery.Credit Suisse analyst Karen Short on December 19 assumed coverage of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) with an Outperform rating with a price target of $170, up from $160. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been securing ""meaningful"" market share since early 2021 and the analyst sees it as ""a well-positioned defensive name in an uncertain macro backdrop"". According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 68 hedge funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q3 2022 increased to $4 billion from $3.78 billion in Q2 2022. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational company that provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide. It operates through five segments – Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a dividend king, with 67 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt. The consumer staples sector was an obvious winner compared to primary indexes in 2022 as investors turned defensive, picking up stocks like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). On December 6, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers raised the firm's price target on Procter &amp; Gamble to $162 from $156 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 69 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of September 2022, compared to 71 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $712 million. In addition to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the premier recession stocks to consider.

87,13635621-6aa2-3042-9687-fc1c8be8868d,KO,2023-01-08,Jim Cramer’s Recession-Proof Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-recession-proof-stock-184341395.html,1673117381,STORY,"['^DJI', 'CVX', 'KO', 'AAPL', 'PG', 'AXP', 'CAT', 'MCD']","[In this article, we discuss Jim Cramer's recession-proof stock picks. To skip to the top four stocks in this list, go to Jim Cramer's Top 4 Recession-Proof Stock Picks.Warning bells for recession started ringing in 2022 and they haven’t stopped since. As if investors weren’t already spooked enough, a fresh warning comes straight from the horse’s mouth. On January 2, IMF’s head Kristalina Georgieva warned the world that 2023 would be tougher than the previous year because the three major economies of the world — the US, the EU and China — are slowing down simultaneously. The head of the IMF believes that in 2023, one-third of the world economy would be in recession.“Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,” Georgieva added.She also said that China’s economic growth will be equal to or below the global economic growth for the first time in 40 years. Over the past few decades, China has been posting record economic growth and has stunned the world with its economic performance. However, the coronavirus outbreak, real estate crisis and severe regulatory pressures spooking the technology companies in the country have wreaked havoc on the country’s growth trajectory.IMF’s chief also said that the US economy looks strong and it could avoid recession. She said the labor market in the country remains strong. However, this strong labor market is something that could bring more pain for investors in the months to come.“This is … a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,” Georgieva said.Major investment firms and economic institutions are now joining the recession chorus. According to Bloomberg, Barclays Capital believes 2023 would be the worst year for the world economy in four decades, while Ned Davis Research Inc. thinks there’s a 65% chance of a worldwide economic downturn. Fidelity International thinks we are headed for a hard landing.Story continuesInflation Expected to Slow DownA latest report from the Dutch financial services firm ING said that inflation might start to come down in the US and there are chances that the Federal Reserve will start decreasing interest rates before eventually halting the hikes. However, the report said that inflation in Europe would take some time to recede.An Unexpected Positive DevelopmentThere’s at least one positive news lately: an unexpected late start to the winter season is keeping natural gas prices low, calming investors around the world who were expecting a major energy crunch during the start of the winter.Jim Cramer's Playbook for RecessionJim Cramer has a huge following online and hundreds of thousands of people listen to his commentary of the US and global stock market and economic situation. In November last year, Jim Cramer shared his playbook for inflation in a program and talked frankly about his strategy to survive through a recession. Cramer said that the Federal Reserve’s chair Jerome Powell doesn’t like inflation at all and he wants investors’ stock portfolios to go down.Cramer said that the Fed is not expected to stop rate hikes anytime soon, which means you should keep selling tech stocks and flock to defensive stocks in sectors like oil, banks, healthcare and consumer products. Cramer said that stocks in these sectors can go up despite inflation because companies in these sectors are more “conservative.”Jim Cramer then talked about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and said that the index is full of relatively cheap stocks. He said that some believe the 30 companies in the Dow are vulnerable to recession. But Cramer believes “that’s just not true, that’s wrong.” Cramer thinks the Dow companies can handle recessions pretty well and recommended investors to pick stocks from the index to prepare for a recession.Our MethodologyIn this article, we picked stocks that are recession-proof based on the investment philosophy of Jim Cramer we talked about above. Cramer is bullish on these stocks, and we have mentioned his thesis for each of these stocks.Jim Cramer's Recession0Proof Stock Picks11. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) makes it to our list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks because the company is part of the Dow Jones index, which Cramer believes you should look for if you want to find recession-proof stocks, as mentioned in the introduction of this article. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is on Jim Cramer radar for quite some time now. In October 2022, Jim Cramer expressed his surprise when American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock tanked after earnings. He said at that time that American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock was a buy and praised the company for hiking its dividend in January. He also said that the company is set to profit as consumers increase travel.A total of 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of the third quarter of 2022.10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Jim Cramer loves Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has been recommending the stock publicly as well as to his investing club. In October, Jim Cramer said that “Apple is at the root of everything” and the stock’s decline has become synonymous with the decline of the entire market. That proved to be true as the stock market ended lower on the first day of 2023, mainly due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s slump. Cramer also said in the same program that Apple is the “greatest stock of all time.”Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a key part of the Dow Jones index, and the company also pays a dividend. These two factors make Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a recession-proof stock, according to Jim Cramer.Hedge funds seem to agree with Cramer. At the end of the third quarter, 140 hedge funds reported having stakes in Apple, compared to 128 funds in the previous quarter. This shows a sharp increase in hedge fund sentiment around Apple shares.9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)As we mentioned in the introduction of this article, Jim Cramer recommends oil stocks to prepare for the upcoming recession. Since Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most important oil stock in the Dow Jones index, we added it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks. Jim Cramer has been a fan of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) for a long time. In April last year, Jim Cramer praised Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s dividend yield and buybacks and said that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most attractive of the large cap stocks in the market.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an ideal stock for recessions. The company has been increasing its dividend for 35 years now. In the third quarter, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) easily crushed analyst estimates and its net income came in at $11.23 billion. Revenue in the period jumped 49%.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)In July last year, Jim Cramer discussed in detail why he thinks The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a suitable stock pick for recessions. Jim Cramer said that in recessions you should hide behind defensive, recession-proof stocks, and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a “textbook” example of such stocks. Cramer said that the beverage business is not a hostage to the economy, by which he means that the business continues to thrive irrespective of the economic conditions since people continue to consume basic beverages like Coca Cola.Cramer said that the economic slowdown could cause a slump in prices of commodities like aluminum and sugar, which would help The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offset the losses it might face due to rising inflation.Recently, UBS analyst Peter Grom and his team said in a note that consumer staples were clear winners in 2022 and they believe many stocks in the group are expected to outperform the market again in 2023. The firm’s analysts are bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), in addition to many other consumer companies.7. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) made it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks due to obvious reasons. The company is a solid dividend payer, it has loads of cash and it is operating in a segment which is not directly affected by recessions. Last month, Jim Cramer recommended McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and said that it is a classic defensive stock that typically continues performing well during tough economic times.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been increasing its dividend for the last 28 consecutive years.A total of 53 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 920 funds reported having stakes in McDonald’s at the end of the September quarter, compared to 50 funds in the previous quarter.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)In October, in a lightning round in his program, Jim Cramer said that he prefer The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) over Walmart. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also a key part of the Dow Jones index, which is the favorite index of Cramer to find stocks for a recession. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best stocks to buy during difficult times since the company has upped its dividend for 66 years in a row. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.41% as of January 3.A total of 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of the third quarter.5. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Jim Cramer was extremely bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) last month as he spoke about the company in a program at CNBC. Cramer said that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the great industrial companies. He said people are “ignoring” Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) and the stock is undervalued. He also thinks that President Biden’s infrastructure plan would help the company.What makes Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) a recession-proof stock is its steady dividend and recession-proof business dynamics. The Down Jones component company has been increasing its dividends consistently for the past 28 years. The demand for its construction equipment keeps rising as the government and private sector initiates more construction projects.In the next part of the article we will discuss the remaining four stocks in this list. All these stocks belong to the healthcare sector. These stocks were recommended by Jim Cramer in a recent program, in which he said that healthcare stocks remained steady in 2022 because they “tend to be recession-resistant stocks.” Let’s find out more. Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's Top 4 Recession-Proof Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:12 Best Performing Growth Stocks in 2022Ken Fisher's Growth Stocks25 Largest Nordic Companies Disclosure.

To be clear, this narrative involves heavy risk. Each of the market ideas on this list carries the potential of delivering double-digit returns. However, taking potshots necessarily entails greater-than-average danger.Still, what makes 2023 so compelling is that several enterprises feature extremely discounted prices. True, discounts alone don’t mean much because businesses can always slip even more. However, not all companies face the same fundamental factors. Certain entities or industries have become more relevant than others, leading to an interesting discussion regarding the best stocks to invest in for the next 12 months.GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$88.51LNGCheniere Energy$139.98WHRWhirlpool$147.68VVVValvoline$33.41SMRNuScale Power$10,56IMAXIMAX.$15.04ROVRRover Group$4.22InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comTo say that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered a brutal 2022 would be a gross understatement. Last year, the GOOG Class C shares gave up nearly 39% of equity value. Granted, it’s not the absolute worst performer within the broader technology sphere. Nevertheless, Alphabet consistently attracted investors over the years until the wheels fell off in late 2021.It’s not just technical rumblings that hurt the enterprise. Toward the end of last year, Alphabet courted high-level criticism, with many voices urging the firm to take aggressive action. By that, we’re talking about layoffs. In addition, activist investors took issue with the company’s Other Bets unit of longshot endeavors.However, faced with myriad uncertainties, I’m confident Alphabet will regain its mojo. As I’ve mentioned before, the company’s Google ecosystem practically owns the internet. Moreover, people will be searching through its YouTube platform to find advice on various topics, particularly business help (as layoffs start to mount). Thus, GOOG represents one of the best stocks to invest in for its comeback potential.Story continuesCheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comUnless you’ve been deliberately ignoring the news throughout 2022, you’re going to know why I selected Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) as one of the best stocks to invest in. It all has to do with the asset that shares the same name as the company’s ticker symbol. With chaos erupting globally because of Russia’s ill-advised decision to invade Ukraine, liquefied natural gas may see an upswing.True, throughout the troubles last year, western European countries began fast-tracking alternatives to Russian hydrocarbons. This pivot included renewable energy infrastructures. However, any dramatic transitions will take time. In the meantime, Russia still commands considerable leverage regarding its LNG exports. Unfortunately, the war shows no sign of ceasing. And it appears that Russian President Vladimir Putin stubbornly locked his legacy in with this senseless military conflict.It’s a cynical framework but it’s also unavoidable. Unless some miracle materializes, global LNG supplies will effectively diminish because of Russia’s energy blackmail. Therefore, basic supply and demand dynamics imply LNG will be one of the best stocks to invest in.Whirlpool (WHR)a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and moreSource: shutterstock.com/Digital GeneticsAt first glance, appliance manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) seems like an utterly ridiculous idea. For one thing, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more boring entity. Secondly, Whirlpool symbolizes an asset class that’s often taken for granted. Here, you’re not going to find the next innovation in digital technologies or an earth-shattering medical breakthrough. Instead, you’re dealing with refrigerators and washing machines.Before you swipe lift, however, consider the basic principles of product engineering. No matter how well-manufactured something is, it’s going to break down at some point. Further, this breakdown period may be pushed forward depending on usage magnitude and frequency.Now, thinking fourth dimensionally, the mass work-from-home experiment translates to common household devices operating much more frequently than anticipated. Therefore, if an appliance were to fail in 2024 based on normal usage, it could fail instead in 2023. Of course, we’re talking about just one appliance. But at scale, this storyline could translate to spiked demand for WHR. That’s why this oddball could rank among the best stocks to invest in.Valvoline (VVV)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comBorrowing the same underlying principle as Whirlpool, Valvoline (NYSE:VVV) should benefit from the increased usage-and-frequency thesis. To better gauge the viability of this specific reasoning, let’s go back to the initial onslaught of the coronavirus. Seemingly overnight, vehicle miles traveled crumbled as government agencies imposed restrictions on non-essential travel. Further, the aforementioned work-from-home experiment made the morning commute an archaic relic.However, the labor market may be returning to normal expectations (as in, back to the office). As Reuters pointed out, one of the clear disadvantages of remote operations is lost productivity. For certain industries such as finance, remote work poses compliance challenges. As well, those logging in from home expose their companies to cybersecurity threats.Experts call this expanded attack surfaces. But upper management can mitigate this risk by simply recalling their employees.For Valvoline, that a majority of drivers still use combustion vehicles represents an upside catalyst waiting in the wings. Thus, the automotive oil and lubricant provider should rank among the best stocks to invest in.NuScale Power (SMR)A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIf 2022 taught us anything, it’s that political correctness alone should not be the arbiter of national energy policy. For instance, at the start of last year, the Washington Post reported that Germany was shutting down additional nuclear power plants. Of course, just two months later, war erupted practically in its backyard, leading to an energy crisis.That’s why I believe NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) represents one of the best stocks to invest in. Leveraging an innovation called small modular reactors, NuScale’s nuclear facilities feature a small footprint (relative to their traditional counterparts). This means SMRs can be developed closer to sources of demand, facilitating greater efficiencies. As well, NuScale delivers advanced safety protocols, helping to ensure proper operations throughout.And fundamentally, nothing comes close to the astounding energy density of nuclear fuel. For instance, one uranium fuel pellet creates as much energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Eventually (probably soon), international policymakers will wake up to scientific realities. That would make SMR a compelling candidate for the best stocks to invest in.Imax (IMAX)the exterior of an Imax theaterSource: imageAllan / Shutterstock.comAdvanced film projection specialist Imax (NYSE:IMAX) suffered a rather harsh performance in 2022. Shares lost 22.5% of equity value, which is conspicuously worse than the benchmark equities index. Further, much of the losses came recently. In the trailing month to the end-of-the-year session, IMAX tumbled almost 14%. The main culprit centered on a lackluster debut of Avatar: The Way of Water.It’s not that the so-called Avatar 2 was a bad film (though it could have used, you know, some editing). Rather, it just didn’t meet incredibly lofty expectations. Plus, Covid-19-related headwinds in the China box office didn’t help matters. Nevertheless, among covering analysts, IMAX enjoys a consensus strong buy rating. In other words, you don’t want to miss the forest from the trees. For starters, Avatar 2 received robust revenue from its second weekend, which occurred during the holidays. And more recent data suggests the film continues to chug along.More importantly, let’s not forget the core attraction. Pound for pound, Imax delivers a reasonably priced entertainment experience. Plus, people can use a delightful distraction if a recession materializes. Therefore, IMAX is one of the best stocks to invest in.Rover (ROVR)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockJust to get the disclosure out of the way upfront, Rover (NASDAQ:ROVR) got the brown stuff beat out of it. I mean, just in the worst way possible. In 2022, ROVR hemorrhaged over 64% of its equity value. For some folks, it might appear like a lost cause. For those that don’t want to deal with it, I totally understand.Nevertheless, Rover – which runs an online marketplace for people to buy and sell pet care services – presents an enticing profile. Essentially, Rover acts just like a freelancer platform. However, rather than swapping cash for Excel spreadsheet-related tasks, Rover connects pet owners with pet service providers. Because Americans collectively spend $123 billion on their furry friends, ROVR deserves consideration despite its volatility.It’s possible that the Covid-19 crisis allowed worker bees to take care of their own pets. However, with the possibility of more back-to-office recalls this year, pet care will become vital. Of course, ROVR remains risky. However, fourth-dimensional thinking possibly makes it one of the best stocks to invest in.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession. Investment advisory Barclays forecasts that 2023 will be one of the worst years for the global economy in forty years. Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession). Similarly, investors prefer to solidify their portfolios with recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In). Some of the best recession stocks to buy for 2023 include Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Story continuesOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 14 stocks that are recession proof. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like alcohol, consumer staples, healthcare, and finance. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 RecessionPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashBest Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession14. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a London-based company that produces, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages under the Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal, Don Julio, Ciroc, Buchanan's, Casamigos, J&amp;B, and Ketel One brands. Alcohol demand surges during recessions, making Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) one of the best stocks to buy before a recession hits in 2023. Consumer demand for Diageo products remains resilient worldwide. Although earnings had been fluctuant in the past, they always rebounded well, and will potentially be solid in the coming economic downturn.On January 4, Credit Suisse analyst Sanjeet Aujla raised the price target on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) to 4,500 GBp from 4,400 GBp and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 20 hedge funds held stakes worth $527.4 million in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 22 funds in the prior quarter worth $887.3 million. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 1.35 million shares worth $229.2 million. Like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is one of the best recession stocks to invest in. Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”13. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based company that develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products. It operates through three segments – Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and Specialty Products Division. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is one of the best recession-proof stocks to invest in this year. The company has a history of 27 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it a reliable income stock to pick up for the volatile market environment. On December 6, Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers raised the firm's price target on Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) to $90 from $85 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time.

Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession).

To skip to the top four stocks in this list, go to Jim Cramer's Top 4 Recession-Proof Stock Picks.Warning bells for recession started ringing in 2022 and they haven’t stopped since. As if investors weren’t already spooked enough, a fresh warning comes straight from the horse’s mouth. On January 2, IMF’s head Kristalina Georgieva warned the world that 2023 would be tougher than the previous year because the three major economies of the world — the US, the EU and China — are slowing down simultaneously. The head of the IMF believes that in 2023, one-third of the world economy would be in recession.“Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,” Georgieva added.She also said that China’s economic growth will be equal to or below the global economic growth for the first time in 40 years. Over the past few decades, China has been posting record economic growth and has stunned the world with its economic performance. However, the coronavirus outbreak, real estate crisis and severe regulatory pressures spooking the technology companies in the country have wreaked havoc on the country’s growth trajectory.IMF’s chief also said that the US economy looks strong and it could avoid recession. She said the labor market in the country remains strong. However, this strong labor market is something that could bring more pain for investors in the months to come.“This is … a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,” Georgieva said.Major investment firms and economic institutions are now joining the recession chorus. According to Bloomberg, Barclays Capital believes 2023 would be the worst year for the world economy in four decades, while Ned Davis Research Inc. thinks there’s a 65% chance of a worldwide economic downturn. Fidelity International thinks we are headed for a hard landing.Story continuesInflation Expected to Slow DownA latest report from the Dutch financial services firm ING said that inflation might start to come down in the US and there are chances that the Federal Reserve will start decreasing interest rates before eventually halting the hikes. However, the report said that inflation in Europe would take some time to recede.An Unexpected Positive DevelopmentThere’s at least one positive news lately: an unexpected late start to the winter season is keeping natural gas prices low, calming investors around the world who were expecting a major energy crunch during the start of the winter.Jim Cramer's Playbook for RecessionJim Cramer has a huge following online and hundreds of thousands of people listen to his commentary of the US and global stock market and economic situation. In November last year, Jim Cramer shared his playbook for inflation in a program and talked frankly about his strategy to survive through a recession. Cramer said that the Federal Reserve’s chair Jerome Powell doesn’t like inflation at all and he wants investors’ stock portfolios to go down.Cramer said that the Fed is not expected to stop rate hikes anytime soon, which means you should keep selling tech stocks and flock to defensive stocks in sectors like oil, banks, healthcare and consumer products. Cramer said that stocks in these sectors can go up despite inflation because companies in these sectors are more “conservative.”Jim Cramer then talked about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and said that the index is full of relatively cheap stocks. He said that some believe the 30 companies in the Dow are vulnerable to recession. But Cramer believes “that’s just not true, that’s wrong.” Cramer thinks the Dow companies can handle recessions pretty well and recommended investors to pick stocks from the index to prepare for a recession.Our MethodologyIn this article, we picked stocks that are recession-proof based on the investment philosophy of Jim Cramer we talked about above. Cramer is bullish on these stocks, and we have mentioned his thesis for each of these stocks.Jim Cramer's Recession0Proof Stock Picks11. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) makes it to our list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks because the company is part of the Dow Jones index, which Cramer believes you should look for if you want to find recession-proof stocks, as mentioned in the introduction of this article. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is on Jim Cramer radar for quite some time now. In October 2022, Jim Cramer expressed his surprise when American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock tanked after earnings. He said at that time that American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stock was a buy and praised the company for hiking its dividend in January. He also said that the company is set to profit as consumers increase travel.A total of 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of the third quarter of 2022.10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Jim Cramer loves Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has been recommending the stock publicly as well as to his investing club. In October, Jim Cramer said that “Apple is at the root of everything” and the stock’s decline has become synonymous with the decline of the entire market. That proved to be true as the stock market ended lower on the first day of 2023, mainly due to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s slump. Cramer also said in the same program that Apple is the “greatest stock of all time.”Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a key part of the Dow Jones index, and the company also pays a dividend. These two factors make Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a recession-proof stock, according to Jim Cramer.Hedge funds seem to agree with Cramer. At the end of the third quarter, 140 hedge funds reported having stakes in Apple, compared to 128 funds in the previous quarter. This shows a sharp increase in hedge fund sentiment around Apple shares.9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)As we mentioned in the introduction of this article, Jim Cramer recommends oil stocks to prepare for the upcoming recession. Since Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most important oil stock in the Dow Jones index, we added it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks. Jim Cramer has been a fan of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) for a long time. In April last year, Jim Cramer praised Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)’s dividend yield and buybacks and said that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most attractive of the large cap stocks in the market.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an ideal stock for recessions. The company has been increasing its dividend for 35 years now. In the third quarter, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) easily crushed analyst estimates and its net income came in at $11.23 billion. Revenue in the period jumped 49%.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)In July last year, Jim Cramer discussed in detail why he thinks The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a suitable stock pick for recessions. Jim Cramer said that in recessions you should hide behind defensive, recession-proof stocks, and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a “textbook” example of such stocks. Cramer said that the beverage business is not a hostage to the economy, by which he means that the business continues to thrive irrespective of the economic conditions since people continue to consume basic beverages like Coca Cola.Cramer said that the economic slowdown could cause a slump in prices of commodities like aluminum and sugar, which would help The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offset the losses it might face due to rising inflation.Recently, UBS analyst Peter Grom and his team said in a note that consumer staples were clear winners in 2022 and they believe many stocks in the group are expected to outperform the market again in 2023. The firm’s analysts are bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), in addition to many other consumer companies.7. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) made it to the list of Jim Cramer’s recession-proof stocks due to obvious reasons. The company is a solid dividend payer, it has loads of cash and it is operating in a segment which is not directly affected by recessions. Last month, Jim Cramer recommended McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock and said that it is a classic defensive stock that typically continues performing well during tough economic times.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has been increasing its dividend for the last 28 consecutive years.A total of 53 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 920 funds reported having stakes in McDonald’s at the end of the September quarter, compared to 50 funds in the previous quarter.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)In October, in a lightning round in his program, Jim Cramer said that he prefer The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) over Walmart. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is also a key part of the Dow Jones index, which is the favorite index of Cramer to find stocks for a recession. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best stocks to buy during difficult times since the company has upped its dividend for 66 years in a row. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.41% as of January 3.A total of 69 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of the third quarter.5. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Jim Cramer was extremely bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) last month as he spoke about the company in a program at CNBC. Cramer said that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the great industrial companies. He said people are “ignoring” Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) and the stock is undervalued. He also thinks that President Biden’s infrastructure plan would help the company.What makes Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) a recession-proof stock is its steady dividend and recession-proof business dynamics. The Down Jones component company has been increasing its dividends consistently for the past 28 years. The demand for its construction equipment keeps rising as the government and private sector initiates more construction projects.In the next part of the article we will discuss the remaining four stocks in this list.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession. Investment advisory Barclays forecasts that 2023 will be one of the worst years for the global economy in forty years. Ned Davis Research put the chances of a crushing global downturn at 65%. Similarly, Fidelity International thinks a hard landing seems inevitable. As the Federal Reserve sticks with its most aggressive fiscal policy in decades, Wall Street consensus is that a mild recession will strike globally even if inflation has peaked.Market experts think there is a 7-in-10 probability that the US economy will slip into a recession in 2023, and they are trimming demand expectations and slashing inflation forecasts in light of tremendous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The median estimates suggest that gross domestic product will average a meagre 0.3% in 2023, including an annualized 0.7% drop in the second quarter and flat data in the first and third quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the GDP, is expected to grow just barely in the middle half of 2023.Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, told Bloomberg on December 20: “The US economy is facing big headwinds from surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, and weak export markets abroad. Businesses have turned cautious about adding to inventories and hiring, and will likely delay construction and other capex plans with credit more expensive and order books shrinking.”During periods of recession and general market volatility, individuals tend to pile into defensive assets like gold (see 13 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For Recession). Similarly, investors prefer to solidify their portfolios with recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In). Some of the best recession stocks to buy for 2023 include Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Story continuesOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 14 stocks that are recession proof. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like alcohol, consumer staples, healthcare, and finance. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 RecessionPhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashBest Stocks To Buy Before the 2023 Recession14. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a London-based company that produces, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages under the Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Crown Royal, Don Julio, Ciroc, Buchanan's, Casamigos, J&amp;B, and Ketel One brands. Alcohol demand surges during recessions, making Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) one of the best stocks to buy before a recession hits in 2023. Consumer demand for Diageo products remains resilient worldwide. Although earnings had been fluctuant in the past, they always rebounded well, and will potentially be solid in the coming economic downturn.On January 4, Credit Suisse analyst Sanjeet Aujla raised the price target on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) to 4,500 GBp from 4,400 GBp and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 20 hedge funds held stakes worth $527.4 million in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 22 funds in the prior quarter worth $887.3 million.

With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”13. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based company that develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products.

Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) is a California-based company that sells discount retail apparel and home fashion accessories under the Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS brand names. It is one of the best stocks to buy for the 2023 recession, as customers tend to gravitate towards off-price stores during difficult times. As of December 19, Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) continues to be seen as a retail sector winner amid the holiday season and continuing inflationary headwinds.On November 21, Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih raised the price target on Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) to $127 from $98 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares.

Ross continues to follow its deep discount strategy, offering consumers bargains on clothing as it executes a “packaway” inventory strategy, scooping up inventory when its buyers perceive bargains in the marketplace, then passing savings on to customers with low-cost retail locations.”11. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) operates as a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States.

The company’s second quarter earnings were slightly below consensus estimates; however, the outlook for the rest of the year showed steady growth despite difficult comparisons with the second half of 2021. O’Reilly Automotive continues to grow its store base and has recently announced an expansion into Mexico. The company operates in an industry where competition has historically remained rational through the economic cycle.”10.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) will announce its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in.

Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) develops, manufactures, and sells healthcare products worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Healthcare is a defensive market sector, which means firms like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) perform well despite a recession backdrop. On December 9, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a $0.51 per share quarterly dividend, an 8.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.47. The dividend is distributable on February 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 13.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 9.12 million shares worth $883.2 million. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), among others, is a good example.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best stocks for a recession-proof portfolio given its defensive nature. On January 5, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022.

(NYSE:WMT), compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q3 2022 increased to $4 billion from $3.78 billion in Q2 2022. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc.
