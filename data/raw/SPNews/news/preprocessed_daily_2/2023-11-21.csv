Some of the best CBI programs are attractive not only for the prospect of global mobility and expanded business opportunities but also due to the potential tax advantages they offer. These tax benefits often encompass lower personal income tax rates, exemptions on foreign-source income, as well as the absence of capital gains and inheritance taxes.', ""CBI programs typically involve making a qualifying investment, such as contributing to a national development fund, purchasing real estate, or other approved investment methods. Following the investment, applicants undergo a comprehensive vetting process to ensure they meet the program's eligibility criteria."", 'High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) and Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) are well aware of the importance of spreading their investments across a variety of asset classes and geographical regions to reduce risk.

However, as of 2023, this allocation has increased to an average of 9.1%, and financial advisors predict it will further rise to 9.6% by 2024. There are several compelling reasons behind the inclusion of alternative investments in client portfolios, with portfolio diversification (50%) being a key factor in reducing volatility, along with the pursuit of new growth opportunities (50%).', 'The report also indicates that HNWI practices are determined to increase their exposure to alternative investments across various strategies over the next two years. Private equity is at the forefront, with 50% of advisors and executives planning to enhance their allocations, followed by private real estate (45%) and direct investments/co-investing (32%). An overwhelming majority of surveyed HNWI practices (94% or more) anticipate either maintaining or expanding their positions in all types of alternative investment opportunities, excluding hedge funds.', 'Citizenship by investment combines the advantages of acquiring citizenship or residency with the potential for financial gains, when primarily opted through real estate investments. This approach melds aspects of immigration and investment strategies, with some degree of overlap, even though it may not fit neatly within the conventional category of ""alternative investments"" in the financial industry. However, its categorization can vary depending on the context, as it effectively serves both purposes concurrently.', 'Beyond diversifying wealth, HNWIs and UHNWIs are now highly attuned to the profound impact of taxation on their fortunes. They diligently seek tax-efficient strategies that enable them to minimize their tax liabilities while maximizing their financial gains.', 'Many CBI programs open up a pathway to secure favorable tax treatment, granting access to more advantageous tax regimes that encompass policies aimed at reducing or entirely exempting income, capital gains, inheritance, and wealth from taxation.', 'By obtaining citizenship or residency in countries with favorable tax arrangements, HNWIs and UHNWIs can legally curtail their tax burdens. This strategic approach empowers them to structure their investments and income in a manner that mitigates the impact of high-tax environments in their home countries, effectively safeguarding and nurturing their wealth.', 'A selection of notable consulting firms that HNWIs and UHNW might find appealing are Verisk Analytics, Inc.

The retreat in bond yields, on continued hopes that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hiking campaign might be nearing an end, has been a significant contributor to the stock rally.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is the outperformer this month, climbing 9.9%, while the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones have risen 7.6% and 5.7%, respectively. With this surge, many ETFs have hit new 52-week high lately or are near their one-year peak. Growth ETFs have taken charge.

The unemployment rate ticked higher as auto strikes weighed on the labor market last month. A continued high level of unfilled job openings and solid private sector balance sheets indicate a “soft” economic landing.Additionally, the fall in oil prices has lent support to the stock market upturn. Concerns about demand, especially from China and the United States, have led to a decrease in oil prices, which in turn could help to ease inflation worries and bolster investor confidence (read: Oil Falls Below $80: ETF Areas to Win/Lose).Further, better-than-expected earnings added to the strength.

Following the mixed inventory numbers, futures settled with a loss week over week, overwhelmed by high production and predictions of insipid weather-related demand.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose 60 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Nov 10. The build compared with the five-year (2018-2022) average net injection of 20 Bcf and last year’s growth of 66 Bcf for the reported week.The latest increase puts total natural gas stocks at 3,833 Bcf, which is 198 Bcf (5.4%) above the 2022 level and 203 Bcf (5.6%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 111.1 Bcf per day, up 1 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to higher shipments from Canada and an increase in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption rose to 111.3 Bcf from 104.6 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting increased residential/commercial usage and higher power burn.', 'Natural gas prices trended downward last week following the latest inventory build. Futures for December delivery ended Friday at $2.960 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating some 2% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is the result of record output and mixed weather predictions.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With forecasts for above-normal temperature in the West offsetting the cooler weather elsewhere, usage of the commodity to generate electricity is expected to be tepid.Moreover, despite record-high lower-48 natural gas production, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down more than 27% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. While falling from their April highs, LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, with union workers planning to resume strikes at LNG facilities in Australia, flows to export plants might be threatened, thereby driving up commodity prices.', 'Following last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down almost 34% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for holding on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of the company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 33.6%. Valued at around $8.1 billion, RRC has gained 19.5% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%.

It’s quite possible that in the near term, speculators could be looking for a quick profit. However, over the long run, it’s difficult to see a circumstance where the discount retail chain recovers. I am bearish on BIG stock because of its spiraling business.', 'Usually, bad news directly impacting a company is responsible for its volatility. Certainly, Big Lots offers plenty to make all but the most intrepid speculators sweat. For example, year-to-date BIG stock has cratered 72%. However, it was a competitor that perhaps broadcasted the loudest warning.', 'Recently, TipRanks reporter Radhika Saraogi stated that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) succumbed to red ink following its third-quarter earnings disclosure and, more importantly, its Q4 sales expectations. On paper, the Q3 results were fairly solid. Adjusted earnings per share landed at $1.53, beating analysts’ target of $1.52. On the top line, sales of $160.8 billion exceeded the consensus view of $159.72 billion.', 'However, it was the current-quarter guidance that sent jitters. Management disclosed expectations of weak consumer spending for the upcoming holiday season. It also revealed a lower-than-expected Fiscal 2024 EPS forecast. Subsequently, WMT tanked as investors digested the news.', 'Still, in the long run, Walmart should be fine. It’s a massive big-box retailer, a one-stop shop for consumers across the income spectrum. Unfortunately, the same confidence cannot be applied to BIG stock.', 'If a powerhouse like Walmart anticipates a weak holiday season, that doesn’t speak highly about Big Lots. Per TipRanks data, after Q4 2021, the embattled retailer has posted consecutive losses per share. Unless it rights the ship quickly, more pain could be on the way.', 'Looking at the framework for BIG stock from a fundamental perspective, it almost seems as if the enterprise is fighting against a downward spiral. Amid tough pressure points like stubbornly-high inflation and fierce retail competition, a less-equipped firm like Big Lots sits at a disadvantage.', 'To be sure, BIG stock has gained in the past week. Much of this may stem from contrarian bullish activity in the options market. Specifically, many pessimists have sold calls against BIG, betting that it won’t rise above $5 by certain expiration dates. However, as the security marches higher toward this level, the bears may be forced to cover their position.', 'Therefore, it’s important to remember that selling BIG stock now may come at the penalty of an opportunity cost. Nevertheless, the fundamentals seem exceedingly ugly. In particular, Big Lots’ gross profit margin hit 41.57% in its second quarter of Fiscal 2020. Since then, however, its gross margin has tumbled to 33% in Q2 2023.', 'In contrast, Walmart – while printing a lower overall gross margin of 24.6% as of the latest reading – has seen this metric stabilize over several years. This consistency affords confidence for investors. On the other hand, the lack of consistency, along with a recent deterioration, casts a dark cloud over BIG stock.', 'Now, at first glance, BIG stock might seem like a bargain to novice investors. After all, the security trades hands at a subterranean trailing-year revenue multiple of 0.02x. In contrast, the specialty retail sector’s average price-to-sales ratio stands at 0.68x. Seems like a killer deal, right?', 'Well, the problem is that because Big Lots’ annual revenue tally has been declining since Fiscal Year 2021, the low multiple is deceptive. In this case, it may be better to seek a higher sales premium but with a superior probability of growth. At the very least, investors should consider enterprises that enjoy stable revenue trajectories, not negative ones.', 'Turning to Wall Street, BIG stock has a Moderate Sell consensus rating based on zero Buys, three Holds, and three Sell ratings. The average BIG stock price target is $6.26, implying 53.8% upside potential.', 'In recent sessions, BIG stock popped higher, likely due to options market speculation. Because of the power of such speculation, it should be respected. At the same time, the fundamentals arguably should be respected more. Here, the Big Lots narrative is suspect because of its contracting revenue and gross margin, along with other headwinds.', 'Disclosure']"

While consumers seem to be ready to increase spending during this holiday season, wallets will certainly be hurt as inflation remains steady for necessities like food. Stacey Widlitz, SW Retail Advisors Chief International Store Hunter, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into where consumers will be looking for the best deals and which retailers poised to capitalize on current economic trends during this holiday season.', 'On where consumers are focused Widlitz explains: ""Obviously consumers are spending on necessities, you know, we\'re talking about disinflation and that\'s great, but the bottom line is food costs are up 20% on a two-year basis and that\'s not declining, that\'s just stagnating. So the consumer is still feeling it and still spending on their basics. I think you\'re going to see a lot of that this holiday season. You\'re already seeing with the likes of Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) they\'re pushing hard on food and basics and health.""', 'Watch the video above to find out which retailers Widlitz are in the best position for what consumers want right now.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- So give us like the big picture, first of all, going into this holiday season. Given what we've heard from the retailers so far where they're definitely sounding a little bit cautious, but given also some of the survey results that show higher spending is coming."", ""STACEY WIDLITZ: Absolutely. And we've heard different stories from different retailers. Obviously, consumers are spending on necessities. We're talking about disinflation and that's great but the bottom line is, food costs are up 20% on a two-year basis and that's not declining, that's just stagnating. So the consumer is still feeling it and still spending on their basics. And I think you're going to see a lot of that this holiday season."", ""And you've already seeing with the likes of Target and Walmart they're pushing really hard on food, and basics, and health. I think the discretionary part of the business everybody said it's still weak, Home Depot, big ticket stuff is weak, Williams-Sonoma, their comps are down double digits on furniture. So there are issues out there."", 'But clearly these stocks have rallied and particularly the underdog retail stocks have rallied 15% to 30%, some of them, because expectations are low. And also, inventories are really lean, very clean going into holiday. So I think investors are giving a pass to the retailers for perhaps disappointing sales as long as their margins are intact.', '- And Stacey, so against that backdrop, we got Black Friday, Cyber Monday coming up here. What are you expecting there.', 'STACEY WIDLITZ: Oh, yeah. My two favorite days of the year.', '[CHUCKLES]', 'So I think, again, as we see inventories, super lean across the board going into these holidays, I think that we might see a little less promotions across the board than usual. You might see a little more up to 40% off, rather than 40% off everything. But some retailers and some brands as usual take the opportunity to throw a 20% off to get the consumer interested, to get them in the store or online to buy other things. But again, I do think this year, that mix shift toward necessities will continue.', ""- Stacy, when you look at who's doing it right, right now or maybe is it the intersection of doing it right and being in the right place in terms of just what consumers want right now. Is there an example or examples that you can think of."", ""STACEY WIDLITZ: Sure, there are several. But Walmart comes to mind. They reported comps that beat and the stock traded down 8% because they've really had the wind to their back. Because inflation that's been up high singles food inflation, double digits over the past two years, has been driving their comp naturally. So that's been a huge tailwind for them."", ""That's coming to an end. And they've talked about that. And at the same time, discretionary hasn't picked up yet. So I think the guys who had this food exposure, things are going to get tougher for them, and also you look at the likes of Target. So their comps were down, their traffic continues to be down. Meanwhile, TJX, Walmart traffic remains up."", ""I think you want to own the players that still have the momentum in their traffic, as we're going into a tougher environment, and you can't push pricing along to the consumer like these brands had. Don't forget, over the last couple of years, we had the likes of Coors, and Tapestry, Coach, Ralph Lauren, who increased prices 20%, 30%. So the consumer's had enough and is pushing back.""]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the multi billionaire dollar hedge fund and what its founder believes is in store for the markets and the economy, then take a look at Citadel Stock Holdings: 5 Biggest Energy Stocks. "", ""With the third quarter hedge fund filing season with us in full flow, it's time to take a look at what the master investors are doing. This year has been a topsy turvy ride for stock markets, and it can very well be argued that had investors not piled into technology stocks in H1 2023 due to the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence, then until November, stocks would have been flat or down."", 'However, November is proving to be a boon for markets. This is because the inflation data for October not only showed a marked sequential drop from September but also ended up undershooting consensus estimates. This caused stocks to rally, with major U.S. stock indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 rising by more than a percent within an hour of opening. With the latest inflation data, the focus on Wall Street has now shifted to when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates as opposed to whether it will deliver another rate hike.', 'One of the biggest threats to the dissipating economic clouds right now is the global energy industry. The energy sector was dead center of the 2022 stock market sell off, the effects of which are still lingering as the S&P 500 is still down from its December 2021 closing. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global energy supply chains and it saw global oil prices shoot up. This ended up pushing inflation to record high levels and spurred central banks to deal hefty economic blows by jacking up the policy rate.', ""With less than half a quarter left until 2023's close, there is a risk that a resurgence in global oil prices could make inflation rear its head once again. If it does, then markets might very well start to fall again as investors price in higher interest rates. Right now, particularly after the bombshell October inflation report, this might be particularly painful for investors since November is perhaps the first time in more than a year that they can wholeheartedly look forward to stock market growth."", ""Yet, as the conventional energy segment is as turbulent as ever, there is a lot of optimism in the clean and alternative energy area. This is because according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Employment report, more than half of the total energy industry employment growth in last year was in sectors such as solar panels, electric cars, metal mining, and heat pumps. All these sectors are part of the renewable energy industry, and they seek to decrease the world's reliance on polluting petroleum fuels. The IEA outlines that solar energy led within the alternative energy sector as it employed four million people."", ""Even though the stock market might fall and cause losses all around, this doesn't mean that everyone loses money. One of the best examples of this fact is billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel Investment Group. Citadel is the ninth biggest hedge fund in the world in terms of net assets, as it controlled $62 billion as of June 2023. The firm's investment portfolio, which is measured through its direct stock holdings and the non market value of options, sat at $466 billion as of Q3 2023 end. So why is Mr. Griffin's fund the right one to study if one wants to know how to make money when others are losing it? Well, the answer is simple. Citadel was the world's best performing hedge fund in 2022, a torrid time for the industry overall that saw hundreds of billions of dollars in losses."", 'So, what does the investment guru believe is in store for us in the future? Well, Mr. Griffin believes that one of the most important indicators that we need to be watching right now is the labor market as according to him:', ""And I think there's a couple of really important questions that will come into bear at that moment in time that should influence one's view as to how deep this recession is going to be. Number 1 is what's going to happen to the fiscal policy of the United States. For choice, we think next year fiscal policy will not tighten that much. We're heading into a presidential election. It's really hard for politicians on either side of the aisle. What we need to do, which is to reign in our deficit spending in front of a presidential election. It's just going to be really hard politically to get there next year on that front."", ""The second real question next year is how much will companies start to unwind the labor hoarding that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been really hard to hire people. And as such large companies have been really reticent to let people go no matter what the circumstances are. So even if margins are contracting, even if you have gains from automation, people have been very reticent to let people go. Now we're starting to see for the first time that unwinding of that labor hoarding. What we don't know is how much of that labor hoarding as taken place. And what worries me, in a hybrid work environment, or work from home environment, the cultural or social contract that holds people together in a company is unquestionably weaker. I mean we've all read about companies that have fired thousands of people on Zoom calls. There's no sense of 'that's Jane, whose worked down the hall with me for years and I'm going to go the extra distance to try to keep Jane employed here'. It's like 'here's the email to all, here's the video conference for the bunch of people, and goodbye'."", ""It's a very different moment in American employment history, where I believe the bond between the company and the employee has become far weaker. And that worries me in terms of the willingness of corporate America to make cuts on their workforce they just won't have made at other similar points in the labor market cycle."", ""With the business world being as dynamic as ever and some interesting times ahead of us, we decided to look at Ken Griffin's top energy stock picks and the leading names are PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), BP p.l.c.

If you want to skip our overview of Stanley Druckenmiller's 2023 stock portfolio, then take a look at the\xa05 Stocks Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Just Bought and Sold. "", ""The third quarter of the 2023 hedge fund filing season is one of the more important ones that we've come across. This is because the third quarter was the first time in months that it appeared that the stock market might be entering a new era. Before developments in November, investors were uncertain about the trajectory that the Federal Reserve might take with its future interest rate decisions. While inflation has dropped in America for most of the year, a robust job market and the recent conflict in the Middle East have nevertheless created uncertainty that the Fed might be back with its interest rate gavel faster than investors can say 'recession.'"", 'However, now not only is inflation undershooting consensus estimates but prices higher up in the supply chain are also falling. At the same time, crude oil is also becoming cheaper, and while all these signals also herald the start of a recession, they make it abundantly clear that if future data releases follow this trend, then the Fed will have few reasons to continue raising interest rates', ""This environment makes the current hedge fund filing season even more important. This is because it's when the funds might be starting to reposition their investment portfolios to account for the changing financial conditions. One hedge fund boss who has seen his fair share of fame in the financial industry is Stanely Druckenmiller. Mr. Druckenmiller ran his own fund for years before retiring and pooling his personal money into the Duquesne Family Office. Running a family office saves him from the stress that comes with managing outsider money, and judging by the family office's latest SEC filings, it appears that Mr. Druckenmiller is doing quite well for himself."", ""His firm's Q3 2023 SEC filings reveal that the investment portfolio was worth $2.7 billion. This marked a small $100 million drop over the second quarter and a sizeable $1 billion increase over the third quarter of 2022. Mr. Druckenmiller had quite a busy third quarter as he added dozens of new companies to his portfolio and completely existed even dozens more. For instance, during the third quarter of 2023, the Duquesne Family Office bought shares of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG), Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), and Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR). These firms belong to a wide variety of sectors, indicating an agnostic approach that appears to be driven by fundamentals as opposed to broader economic trends."", ""As to what's on Mr. Druckenmiller's mind these days, here's what he had to say during a recent fireside chat along with billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. According to the billionaire:"", ""I did an interview, about a year ago, and said for the first time I was more worried about growth in this country than inflation. That has a dangling participle to it because that was sort of an intermediate forecast, wrong on growth, right on finflation by the way, very wrong on growth. But going forward, I would say this. I grew up in the 70s, that's when I started in the business. And you had a few periods where inflation came down from like seven to three or seven to four, and thy thought they had it bet and Arthur Burns put his foot on the gas and as everybody knows now it ended up you 12 or 13 before Volcker came in and smashed it. That's a big debate now for money managers. I don't have to answer that question yet, but since you asked it, I guess I do because we're in front of a bunch of smart people. I would say this: Under a Trump administration, what I would be terrified of because he's a big spender, he doesn't believe in the Federal Reserve, we go back to the Arthur Burns model times two. So, you have fiscal recklessness, un abandon, just like he's run his business. And on top of that, he puts a puppet into the Federal Reserve. Under that model, you have to be open minded to eight to ten percent inflation, a takeoff like you did in the 70s after probably an intermediate lull here after a year or two. You didn't give me a third option, which I would say is a non-Trump Republican. There are candidates out there where I could see the opposite. You get the debt blowup and something really horrible happens, and you potentially get deflation. But, under that case I guess my central case would be somewhere in the three or four area. Again, don't trade on any on this, we're just talking about the future and we'll change our mind five times between now and then."", ""So, with Mr. Druckenmiller being as prescient as ever, it's absolutely essential to know which stocks he's buying and which stocks he's selling.

It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Starbucks basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Starbucks, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.1%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

Cohen suggested that it might be a momentary setback or what he called ""a fake scare,"" catching people off guard temporarily before a market rebound. He emphasized that this downturn would likely be short-lived, foreseeing a quick recovery possibly by the first quarter of the following year. Mr. Cohen remains optimistic about the economy, expressing a ""pretty positive"" outlook despite uncertainties.

It offers clothes, accessories, jewelry, and drinks. All are subject to different variables that affect them at different times.

Recently, President New Energy Gavin Rennick of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB) made a significant move by selling 6,675 shares of the company's stock. This transaction, executed on November 20, 2023, has raised questions and speculation among market watchers."", ""Gavin Rennick serves as the President of New Energy at Schlumberger Limited, a role that places him at the forefront of the company's ventures into renewable energy and sustainability initiatives. His position involves steering the company's strategy and operations in the burgeoning new energy sector, which is increasingly important as the world shifts towards cleaner energy sources. Rennick's insider status and his recent stock sale thus carry weight, as they may reflect his confidence in the company's direction and financial health."", 'Schlumberger Limited is a global giant in the oilfield services sector, providing technology, project management, and information solutions to the oil and gas industry. With operations in over 120 countries, SLB offers a wide array of services, including drilling, production, and processing to the exploration and production (E&P) companies. As the energy landscape evolves, SLB has been expanding its reach into new energy ventures, positioning itself as a key player in the transition to a more sustainable energy future.', ""The insider transaction history for SLB reveals a pattern that could be telling for investors. Over the past year, there has been a notable imbalance between insider sells and buys, with 26 insider sells compared to a single insider buy. This trend could be interpreted in various ways, but it often suggests that insiders, who are privy to the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings, may see the current stock price as favorable for liquidating some of their holdings."", ""When examining the relationship between insider transactions and stock price, it's crucial to consider the context. Gavin Rennick's sale of 6,675 shares follows a year where he sold a total of 62,225 shares and made no purchases. This pattern of behavior could indicate a lack of intent to increase his stake in the company at current prices or could be part of a personal financial management strategy."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, SLB shares were trading at $52.88, giving the company a substantial market cap of $75.336 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 18.25, which is above the industry median of 9.23 but below the company's historical median. This suggests that while SLB is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers, it may still be undervalued based on its own historical standards.The price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.03 indicates that SLB is Fairly Valued according to the GuruFocus Value, which is calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates."", ""The GF Value serves as a benchmark for investors, and a price-to-GF-Value ratio close to 1 suggests that the stock is trading at a price that aligns with its intrinsic value. This could mean that the market has efficiently priced in SLB's current fundamentals and future prospects as estimated by analysts."", ""The sale of 6,675 shares by President New Energy Gavin Rennick is a move that warrants attention from SLB investors and market analysts alike. While insider sells can be motivated by various personal or strategic reasons, they are always worth noting, especially when they follow a consistent pattern over time. With SLB's focus on new energy and its current valuation metrics, investors should keep a close eye on insider activity as it may offer valuable insights into the company's confidence in its strategic direction and growth potential. As always, such transactions should be considered as part of a broader investment strategy and not as sole indicators of a stock's future performance."", 'Warning!

If everyone around them is going for little splurges like face masks, it's easier to justify shelling out for another perfume."", ""It’s also a sign of the times, as people return to working and socializing in person. However, the pandemic provided an initial boost to the cosmetics industry; Target's beauty sales shot up 19% in 2020."", 'Many remote workers went for beauty products to spruce up for Zoom meetings during the shutdown, said Charm.', 'Since then, growth in the category has remained strong. It has now slowed down a bit but won’t go away anytime soon as self-care and wellness trends “are strengthening,” according to Charm.', 'Beauty products get shoppers in the door too, which then leads to more sales of other items.', 'For example, Kohl’s formed a partnership with Sephora back in 2021 in an attempt to attract new customers.', 'On a call with investors in August, CEO Tom Kingsbury said Sephora at Kohl\'s is ""exceeding"" expectations — with a 90% uptick in total beauty sales compared to last year — and is ""bringing in new customers that are shopping more frequently.""', 'Kingsbury added that Sephora customers are typically a younger and more diverse crowd.

As you're all aware, in March, we announced my pending retirement as CEO. At that time, Tony Spring became President and CEO-Elect of Macy's, Inc., and Adrian Mitchell was promoted to the dual role of COO and CFO. While I remain the CEO through the end of this fiscal year, today marks my last earnings call. Between now and then, I will work to ensure a smooth and successful holiday season, which for many starts with our iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year, we had the incomparable share as our headliner. Following Thanksgiving, we enter our most important sales period. Across nameplates, we have refined our gift assortment and improved our shopping experience."", ""We know our customer is looking for value, so we have simplified our promotions. We are confident the strategic changes we have made will be well received by our customers. I'm now going to turn the call over to Tony to discuss our Q3 results, holiday plans by nameplate and how he's thinking about the future. From there, Adrian will go over our five value creation levers and outlook for the remainder of the year. And then, I'll close with reflections on my time as CEO. With that, Tony, I'm going to hand it over to you."", ""Tony Spring: Good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking Jeff for his support. Jeff, as we sit here today on your last earnings call, it has been a privilege working with you. Throughout the years, you've illustrated what it takes to be a successful and empathetic CEO. From everyone across the Macy's, Inc. family, thank you for your service. And on your last call, I'm pleased to report the third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $0.21 was above our expectations. Our sales, gross margin, and SG&A rates were all better than expected. We also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. We ended the quarter in a clean inventory position, down 6% to last year and down 17% to 2019 with Macy's and Bloomingdale's aged inventory down a combined 26%."", ""By nameplate, Macy's net sales declined 7.9%, and comparable sales declined 6.7% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Sales results exceeded expectations with strength in beauty, particularly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, women's career sportswear, and men's tailored clothing. Women's casual sportswear, big ticket and handbags were challenged. In late October, Nike arrived in 75 stores and online and we introduced UGG Home in 200 stores and online. Both are off to a strong start. At our off-price division Backstage, comparable owned sales outperformed the Macy's full-line stores in which they operate by about 720 basis points. At Bloomingdale's, results were roughly in line with our expectations as we lapped last year's 150th anniversary celebration, which included over 8.6 billion organic media impressions."", ""Net sales declined 2.6%, and comparable sales were down 4.4% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Beauty, women's contemporary apparel, and shoes were top performing categories, while men's, home, and designer handbags were more challenged. During the quarter, we added several exciting new brands such as Veronica Beard, Hatch and Alex Mill. We also launched an Aqua collaboration with Kerri Rosenthal in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Bloomingdale's outlet comparable sales outperformed full-line Bloomingdale's stores by about 860 basis points. Bluemercury had its 11th consecutive quarter of growth, with both net and comparable sales of 2.5%. Customers responded well to skincare and color cosmetics, which are our largest categories. And feedback on Cerulean 6, its recently launched proprietary bath and body brand, has been positive."", 'During the quarter, Bluemercury also unveiled a redesigned luxury store and spa experience in New Canaan, Connecticut. This will serve as the prototype for future locations. Looking to holiday, our outlook, which Adrian will discuss shortly, assumes that our customer cross-nameplate continues to be under pressure and discerning and how they spend in discretionary categories we offer. We have the flexibility to react to customer demand with increased open-to-buy reserves versus last year. We will be nimble and competitive with promotions as needed while sustaining healthy gross margins and plan to end the fourth quarter in an appropriate inventory position. Each nameplate in our portfolio is focused on providing the best experience for their respective customer this holiday season, with new and exciting gifts across the value spectrum.', 'And we\'re ready to fulfill our customers\' needs online, in-store, and through our gift guides. At Macy\'s, the messaging around ""Give Love. Give Style"" holiday campaign, first introduced last year, has evolved. We have clear customer-facing language that drives authority, discovery, and conversion. In the fourth quarter, we over-indexed in beauty with sales penetration in this top-performing category typically rising by approximately 300 basis points compared to the balance of the year. This year, we have new partners like JLo Beauty and are offering Make Your Own gift stations and exclusive sets from many of the biggest brands in the industry including CHANEL, Dior and La Mer. Outside of beauty, we have updated our private brand Cashmere, refined our fine and fashion jewelry selection, including offering Pandora in more stores and online, and added exclusive Disney 100th anniversary product and experiences to our gifting selections.', 'At Bloomingdale\'s, we\'re embracing retail as theater through our ""Best Holiday Ever"" campaign, which features in-store and digital activations. Throughout the season, customers can look forward to exciting curated gift assortments from our top brands, including MFK, [Montclair] (ph), and Baccarat, as well as immersive shopping experiences and celebrations including our Wonka-inspired collection featuring exclusive products from David Yurman, Kurt Geiger, [Reese] (ph), and more. At Bluemercury, we\'re featuring new brands in critical skincare, body and fragrance, including SkinMedica, Aesop, and D.S. & Durga. Our customers have the opportunity to experience new in-person spa treatments, complimentary gift consultations, and exclusive loyalty member activations.', ""Looking beyond holiday, I am confident we can evolve Macy's, Inc. into a more relevant destination of choice for our customers and partners. The fundamentals are there. We have a balanced portfolio of nameplates, each with its own identity. This is a distinct advantage. We can learn from each other without becoming one another as we remove silos to optimize our collective customer insights. We are also balancing art and science. I like to say that this is STEAM, not STEM. We are embracing data science tools, including AI and machine learning, to drive more accurate and agile decision-making based on changes in demand. This, married with the art of human judgment, helps us become more proactive and customer influenced. We're emphasizing variety versus redundancy."", ""The customer today does not want an endless aisle. They want the best aisle, which provides an improved assortment, leveraging the use of data-driven tools working closely with our vendor partners. Our balanced approach rooted in customer insights will help us strengthen our core business and scale our five growth vectors, which I'll delve into now, starting with Macy's private brand reimagination. We launched our new private brand, On 34th, in August. Then in September, we rolled out the next phase of the I.N.C. reimagination, further elevating our design strategy and fashion offering. We've been pleased with the performance of both and are taking learnings to fuel our comprehensive private brand strategy. In our second growth vector, small-format stores, we continue to open new Macy's and Bloomie's locations."", ""As a reminder, these average roughly one-fifth the size of our full-line stores. Our portfolio of small-format stores continues to generate year-over-year comparable owned-plus-licensed sales growth. Customers appreciate the store environment, service, and ease of checkout, while feedback on shopping inspiration and styling ideas has been steadily improving. Today, we operate 15 small-format locations, including 12 Macy's and three Bloomie's. In the third quarter, we opened a small-format Macy's in Las Vegas, Chicagoland and Boston. And this month, we opened another in San Diego and a new Bloomie's in Seattle. This is our first physical brick-and-mortar Bloomingdale's representation in the market and it's off to a great start. As announced in October, we plan to open up to 30 additional small-format Macy's locations through fall 2025, and are committed to expanding Bloomie's as well."", ""Touching on the remaining growth vectors, Macy's digital marketplace continues to scale. It had over 1,500 brands on the platform at the end of the third quarter and grew gross merchandise value by approximately 22% on a consecutive quarterly basis. Bloomingdale's introduced its marketplace in July and had 55 curated brands available at the end of the quarter. Across both marketplaces, we're experiencing healthy cross-shopping, resulting in higher average order value and increased units per order. Turning to our fourth growth vector, luxury. We view Bloomingdale's as a winning option for multi-branded upscale retail. Our mix of aspirational products across categories and price points combined with a modern personalized shopping experience resonates with our customers."", ""Bluemercury is establishing itself as a skincare authority with a leading assortment of cutting-edge derma products and services, and Macy's Beauty as an accessible luxury beauty destination with the power to scale elevated brands. We view our positioning and offerings across all three nameplates as a competitive advantage as the luxury business continues to normalize. We remain confident in luxury's long-term growth potential. Our fifth growth vector is personalized offers and communications. Our team has been testing and learning throughout the year, including the recent launch of several new multi-touch journeys. We're seeing positive signals and are excited to move from testing to scaling in 2024. Before handing it over to Adrian, I want to thank our teams for their hard work and dedication to our customers."", ""And, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to our new Bloomingdale's CEO, Olivier Bron. With 20-plus years of international retail and consulting experience, Olivier brings a differentiated global view that will further elevate Bloomingdale's. I am confident in our leadership team and their ability to navigate an uncertain environment, macroeconomic challenges, and industry headwinds. We are committed to making the appropriate strategic investments to fuel our ongoing evolution and achieve low single-digit sales growth beginning in 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Adrian."", ""Adrian Mitchell: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing our five value creation levers, I would like to thank Jeff for his partnership, guidance, and support. When I joined the company three years ago, it was because of the quality of the team led by Jeff and his commitment to transforming Macy's, Inc. into a modern omnichannel retailer. Under Jeff's leadership, we have returned the company to financial health and operational stability and have established the foundation for growth. Now, let's discuss third quarter results and our five value creation levers. First, omnichannel sales. Net sales of $4.86 billion declined 7.1% versus the prior year. Comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis decreased 6.3%."", ""Owned AUR rose 5.2%, driven primarily by changes in product and category mix. Other revenues of $178 million were 3.7% of net sales. Macy's Media Network revenue grew $5 million, or 16%, from the prior year and was better than our expectations. Credit card revenues of $142 million, or 2.9% of net sales, declined $64 million or 100 basis points versus last year. The decline was primarily due to higher bad debt assumptions within the portfolio as expected. Credit card revenues as well as delinquency rates and bad debt levels within the portfolio were in-line with our expectations. Our card holders have the capacity to spend on their proprietary and co-brand cards. FICO scores for new accounts have risen over the last three years and are higher than the overall receivable portfolio, which is largely prime."", ""Looking to the remainder of the year, there is no change to our annual credit card revenue assumption as a percent of net sales or expected delinquency rates and bad debt levels. The second value creation lever is gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 40.3%, 160 basis points higher than last year. Merchandise margin improved 110 basis points, largely due to lower permanent markdowns within the Macy's nameplate. Improved freight expense also benefited merchandise margin during the quarter. Partially offsetting these benefits were anticipated changes in category mix inclusive of the transitional impacts of our private brand reimagination as we exit brands and, as discussed on our second quarter call, a shift in the timing of shortage recognition informed by June physical inventory counts."", 'The third quarter shortage impact and our annual shortage assumption remain materially unchanged from our prior expectations. Compared to last year, delivery expense as a percent of net sales improved 50 basis points, primarily reflecting improvement in merchandise allocations resulting in reductions in packages per orders and distance traveled. This work is closely tied to the third value creation lever, inventory productivity. Our supply chain is flowing smoothly. End-of-quarter inventory was down 6% year-over-year and down 17% versus 2019, inclusive of the typical seasonal build for holiday. Trailing 12-month inventory turn was up 1% to last year. Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&A of $2 billion declined $48 million or 2% from prior year.', 'SG&A dollars benefited from our commitment to ongoing expense discipline. Versus our prior expectations, SG&A dollars were favorable due to a roughly $10 million timing shift of certain previously forecasted expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of total revenue was 40.5%, 230 basis points higher than last year, reflective of the year-over-year decline in sales. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.21 versus $0.52 last year, benefiting from better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&A rates, improved interest expense and a low tax rate. The shift in timing of $10 million of SG&A expenses, combined with the lower interest expense and tax rate, contributed roughly $0.10 to EPS versus our prior expectations.', ""Lastly, the fifth value creation lever, capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated $158 million of operating cash flow versus $488 million last year; had $749 million of capital expenditures; free cash flow, inclusive of proceeds from real estate, was an outflow of $555 million; and we have paid $135 million in dividends. Liquidity and a healthy balance sheet remain top priorities. We continue to deploy capital prudently to ensure financial flexibility and to invest in long-term growth. Now, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year outlooks. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales of $7.95 billion to $8.25 billion, including the 53rd week. Our sales outlook reflects our confidence in Macy's, Inc. as a gift-giving destination, including the expected increase in beauty sales penetration, particularly fragrances."", 'Gross margin rate to be at least 220 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we experienced higher markdowns and promotions as we took actions to respond to the heightened competitive environment. Our gross margin outlook gives us the latitude to respond to changes in the promotional landscape. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85 to $2.10, which takes into account the previously discussed $10 million shift in timing of certain SG&A expenses into the fourth quarter as well as an incremental $15 million of combined investments in marketing and our growth vectors. Together, these items are anticipated to impact fourth quarter EPS by $0.07. End-of-quarter inventory is roughly flat to last year and down approximately 18% to 2019.', 'Inventories reflect a higher penetration of transitional and seasonal merchandise relative to last year and a build in our reimagined private brand portfolio, and the anticipated closure of less than 10 locations in early 2024. Taking into account third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook, this brings our full year expectations to net sales of $22.9 billion to $23.2 billion; a comparable sales decline on a 52-week owned-plus-licensed basis of 6% to 7%; other revenue to be about 3.2% of net sales, with credit card revenues accounting for roughly 81%; a gross margin rate of 38.4% to 38.5%; SG&A as a percent of total revenue to be about 35.2% to 35.5% or 36.4% to 36.6% as a percent of net sales; asset sale gains of approximately $45 million; adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.9% to 9.1% or 9.1% to 9.4% as a percent of net sales; and interest expense of approximately $140 million.', 'After interest and taxes, we are narrowing our annual adjusted diluted EPS outlook to $2.88 to $3.13, which includes an updated annual diluted share expectation of 278 million shares. As we position for sales growth next year and beyond, our decisions are centered on our customer. We must deliver relevant products, strong value and a more enjoyable shopping experience. From optimizing our physical footprint to providing compelling experiences across channels, to modernizing technology, to driving efficiencies, to automating personalized offers and communications, we are committed to bringing more inspiration on a daily basis to our customers. We look forward to sharing more on how that ladders to long-term profitable growth on our fourth quarter call.', ""And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Jeff one last time."", 'Jeff Gennette: Thank you, Adrian. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to comment on my seven years as CEO. While I did not achieve everything I had set out to accomplish, I am proud of my contributions. We exited the pandemic a healthier and more agile company, leaning into data-driven tools and processes to guide a renewed focus on expense and inventory disciplines. In addition, we significantly improved the health of our balance sheet, paid down debt, pushed out material debt maturities to 2027 and extended the term of our asset-based credit facility. We invested in our colleagues across the company and strengthened our culture of inclusivity. We introduced our social purpose platform, Mission Everyone, directing $5 billion through 2025 to partners, products, people and programs that help create a more equitable and sustainable future.', ""We also reached 99% pay equity across gender and race and launched S.P.U.R. Pathways, which provides funding to diverse-owned and underrepresented businesses.

And will shoppers find bargains this year?,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-black-friday-shoppers-bargains-193355255.html,1700249635,STORY,['M'],"['(Adds estimated numbers in paragraph 13)', 'By Juveria Tabassum, Savyata Mishra', 'Nov 16 (Reuters) - Retailers are preparing for what they hope will be yet another record-setting global shopping spree on Black Friday, the fourth Friday of November, which this year is Nov. 24. Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season. Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.', ""WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?"", 'Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued. Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.', '""What we know is Black Friday, because it\'s so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?"", 'Retailers including Best Buy, Macy\'s, H&M and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu are already touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores. Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it. Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.', 'ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR?', 'Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.', 'But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.', 'Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.', 'Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.', 'Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.', 'Among them is Kohl\'s, which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.', ""Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics."", ""WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR? Several major retailers from Dollar General to Walmart and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites."", ""Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom compared to last year."", 'Adobe said online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture.', 'HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND? Holiday sales online and in U.S. stores are expected to rise between 3% and 4% during November and December, their slowest pace in five years, according to a forecast by the NRF.', 'Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.', 'An estimated 132 million Americans plan to shop the pre-holiday sales such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2023, from an estimated 140 million shoppers last year, according to a report by fintech firm Finder.', 'In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.', 'WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS? With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.', 'Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.', ""WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR? IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple's iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China."", 'Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard. Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel\'s ""Spider-Man 2"".', 'Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?"", 'Macy\'s CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. ""We\'re in the midst of that along with our competitors, customers are taking advantage of that.""', 'Mattel President Steve Totzke told Reuters on Monday that he is expecting a strong Black Friday and run-up to the holidays even as the toymaker warned of slowing demand for the toy industry last month.', '($1 = 0.8048 pounds) (Reporting by Juveria Tabassum and Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru, Richa Naidu in London, additional reporting by Helen Reid in London; Editing by Josie Kao)']"

And you're putting more dollars in food, and energy, and interest rates, and that's really impacting the sentiment and psyche of the consumer."", ""ED YRUMA: For Walmart, they introduced this theme, and we've started to grapple with it, of what happens to grocery in a deflationary environment? It's clearly been a nice tailwind for them. They benefited because you drive more footsteps in the door and then you can buy other things within the store. So Walmart has clearly been a strong beneficiary, I think, of stronger grocery trends."", ""Now, they would argue that if we get deflation, then that's more money that the consumer can spend elsewhere, and hopefully spend at Walmart. But I think it's just a different shift that the investors are having to grapple with."", ""ZACHARY WARRING: They're definitely going in the right direction.

So that's why you're seeing the reaction to the stock in after hours."", ""But we'd like to see their bigger brands-- so, obviously, Old Navy had pretty strong sales this quarter relative to other retailers.

While I remain the CEO through the end of this fiscal year today marks my last earnings call. Between now and then, I will work to ensure a smooth and successful holiday season, which for many starts with our iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year, we had the incomparable share as our headliner. Following Thanksgiving, we enter our most important sales period. Across nameplates, we have refined our gift assortment and improved our shopping experience. We know our customer is looking for value, so we have simplified our promotions. We are confident the strategic changes we have made will be well received by our customers. I'm now going to turn the call over to Tony to discuss our third quarter results, holiday plans by nameplate and how he's thinking about the future. From there, Adrian will go over our 5 value creation levers and outlook for the remainder of the year, and then I'll close with reflections on my time as CEO. With that, Tony, I'm going to hand it over to you."", 'Antony Spring', ""Good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking Jeff for his support. Jeff, as we sit here today on your last earnings call, it has been a privilege working with you. Throughout the years, you've illustrated what it takes to be a successful and empathetic CEO. And from everyone across the Macy's Inc. family, thank you for your service. And on your last call, I'm pleased to report that third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $0.21 was above our expectations. Our sales, gross margin and SG&A rates were all better than expected. We also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. We ended the quarter in a clean inventory position, down 6% to last year and down 17% to 2019 with Macy's and Bloomingdale's aged inventory data combined 26%. By nameplate, Macy's net sales declined 7.9% and comparable sales declined 6.7% on an owned plus licensed basis. Sales results exceeded expectations with strength in beauty, particularly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, women's career sportswear and men's tailored clothing. Women's casual sportswear, big ticket and handbags were challenged. In late October, Nike arrived in 75 stores and online, and we introduced UGG Home in 200 stores and online. Both are off to a strong start. At our Off-Price division, Backstage, comparable owned sales outperformed the Macy's full-line stores in which they operate by about 720 basis points. At Bloomingdale's, results were roughly in line with our expectations as we lapped last year's 150th anniversary celebration, which included over 8.6 billion organic media impressions. Net sales declined 2.6% and comparable sales were down 4.4% on an owned plus licensed basis. Beauty, women's contemporary, apparel and shoes were top-performing categories while men's, home and designer handbags were more challenged. During the quarter, we added several exciting new brands such as Veronica Beard, Hatch and Alex Mill. We also launched an Aqua collaboration with Kerri Rosenthal in honor of breast cancer awareness month. Bloomingdale's outlet comparable sales outperformed full-line Bloomingdale stores by about 860 basis points. Bluemercury had its 11th consecutive quarter of growth, with both net and comparable sales up 2.5%. Customers responded well to skin care and color cosmetics, which are our largest categories. And feedback on Trillian 6, its recently launched proprietary Bath & Body brand has been positive. During the quarter, Bluemercury also unveiled a redesigned luxury store in spa experience in New Canaan, Connecticut. This will serve as the prototype for future locations. Looking to holiday, our outlook, which Adrian will discuss shortly assumes that our customer across nameplate continues to be under pressure and discerning in how they spend in discretionary categories we offer. We have the flexibility to react to customer demand with increased open-to-buy reserves versus last year. We will be nimble and competitive with promotions as needed while sustaining healthy gross margins and plan to end the fourth quarter in an appropriate inventory position. Each nameplate in our portfolio is focused on providing the best experience for the respective customer this holiday season with new and exciting gifts across the value spectrum. And we're ready to fulfill our customers' needs online, in-store and through our gift guidance. At Macy's, the messaging around Give Love. Give Style, holiday campaign first introduced last year has evolved. We have clear customer-facing language that drives authority, discovery and conversion. In the fourth quarter, we over-indexed in beauty with sales penetration in this top-performing category typically rising by approximately 300 basis points compared to the balance of the year. This year, we have new partners like JLO Beauty and are offering Make Your Own Gift Stations and inclusive sets for many of the biggest brands in the industry, including Chanel, De York and La Mer. Outside of Beauty, we have updated our private brand, Cashmere. We find our fine and fashion jewelry selection including offering Pandora and more stores and online and added exclusive Disney 100th anniversary product and experiences to our gifting selections. At Bloomingdale's, we're embracing retailer theater through our best holiday of our campaign which features in-store and digital activations. Throughout the season, customers can look forward to exciting curated gift assortments from our top brands, including MMK, Mind Flayer and (inaudible) as well as immersive shopping experiences and celebrations, including our Walk Inspired collection featuring exclusive products from David Yurman, Kurt Geiger, Reese and more.At Bluemercury, we're featuring new brands in critical skin care, body and fragrance including SkinMedica, Assaf, and D. S. & Durga. Our customers have the opportunity to experience new in person spa treatments, complementary gift consultations and exclusive loyalty member activations. Looking beyond Holiday, I am confident we can evolve Macy's Inc. into a more relevant destination of choice for our customers and partners. The fundamentals are there. We have a balanced portfolio of nameplates, each with its own identity. This is a distinct advantage. We can learn from each other without becoming one another as we remove silos to optimize our collective customer insights. We are also balancing art and science. I'd like to say that this steam not stem. We are embracing data science tools, including AI and machine learning to drive more accurate and agile decision-making based on changes in demand. This married with the art of human judgment helps us become more proactive and customer influence. We're emphasizing variety versus redundancy. The customer today does not want an endless aisle. They want the best style, which provides an improved assortment, leveraging the use of data-driven tools, working closely with our vendor partners. Our balanced approach rooted in customer insights will help us strengthen our core business and scale our 5 growth vectors, which I'll delve into now, starting with Macy's private brand reimagination. We launched our new private brand On 34th in August. And in September, we rolled out the next phase of the Inc Reimagination, further elevating our design strategy and fashion offering. We've been pleased with the performance of both and are taking learnings to fuel our comprehensive private brand strategy. In our second growth vector, small format stores, we continue to open new Macy's and Bloomies locations. As a reminder, these average roughly 1/5 the size of our full-line stores. Our portfolio of small format stores continue to generate year-over-year comparable owned plus license sales growth. Customers appreciate the store environment, service and ease of checkout while feedback on shopping inspiration and styling ideas has been steadily improving. Today, we operate 15 small-format locations, including 12 Macy's and 3 Bloomie's. In the third quarter, we opened a small format, Macy's in Las Vegas, Chicagoland and Boston. And this month, we opened another in San Diego and the new Bloomie's in Seattle. This is our first physical brick-and-mortar Bloomingdale representation in the market, and it's off to a great start.As announced in October, we plan to open up to 30 additional small-format Macy's locations through fall 2025 and are committed to expanding Bloomie's as well. Touching on the remaining growth vectors, Macy's digital marketplace continues to scale. It had over 1,500 brands on the platform at the end of the third quarter and grew gross merchandise value by approximately 22% on a consecutive quarterly basis. Bloomingdale's introduced its marketplace in July and had 55 curated brands available at the end of the quarter. Across both marketplaces, we're experiencing healthy cross-shopping, resulting in higher average order value and increased units per quarter. Turning to our fourth growth vector, Luxury. We view Bloomingdale's as a winning option for multi-branded upscale retail. Our mix of aspirational products across categories and price points, combined with a modern personalized shopping experience resonates with our customers. Bluemercury is establishing itself as a skin care authority with a leading assortment of cutting-edge derma products and services. And Macy's beauty is an accessible luxury beauty destination with the power to scale elevated brands. We view our positioning and offerings across all 3 nameplates as a competitive advantage as the Luxury business continues to normalize. We remain confident in Luxury's long term growth potential. Our fifth growth vector is Personalized Offers and Communications. Our team has been testing and learning throughout the year, including the recent launch of several new multi-touch journeys. We're seeing positive signals and are excited to move from testing to scaling in 2024. Before handing it over to Adrian, I want to thank our teams for their hard work and dedication to our customers. And I'd like to extend a warm welcome to our new Bloomingdale's CEO, Olivier Bron with 20-plus years of international retail and consulting experience, Olivier brings a differentiated global view that will further elevate Bloomingdale's. I am confident in our leadership team and their ability to navigate an uncertain environment, macroeconomic challenges and industry headwinds. We are committed to making the appropriate strategic investments to fuel our ongoing evolution and a few low single-digit sales growth beginning in 2024.With that, let me turn it over to Adrian."", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing our 5 value creation levers, I would like to thank Jeff for his partnership, guidance and support. When I joined the company 3 years ago, it was because of the quality of the team, led by Jeff and his commitment to transforming Macy's Inc. into a modern omnichannel retailer.Under Jeff's leadership, we have returned the company to financial health and operational stability and have established the foundation for growth. Now let's discuss third quarter results and our 5 value creation levers. First, omnichannel sales. Net sales of $4.86 billion declined 7.1% versus the prior year. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 6.3%. Owned AUR rose 5.2%, driven primarily by changes in product and category mix. Other revenues of $178 million were 3.7% of net sales. Macy's Media Network revenue grew $5 million or 16% from the prior year and was better than our expectations. Credit card revenues of $142 million or 2.9% of net sales, declined $64 million or 100 basis points versus last year. The decline was primarily due to higher bad debt assumptions within the portfolio as expected. Credit card revenues as well as delinquency rates and bad debt levels within the portfolio were in line with our expectations.Our cardholders have the capacity to spend on their proprietary and co-brand cards. FICO scores for new accounts have risen over the last 3 years and are higher than the overall receivable portfolio, which is largely prime. Looking to the remainder of the year, there is no change to our annual credit card revenue assumption as a percent of net sales or expected delinquency rates and bad debt levels.The second value creation lever is gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 40.3%, 160 basis points higher than last year. Merchandise margin improved 110 basis points, largely due to lower permanent markdowns within the Macy's nameplate. Improved freight expense also benefited merchandise margin during the quarter. Partially offsetting these benefits were anticipated changes in category mix inclusive of the transitional impacts of our private brand, Reimagination as we exit brands and as discussed on our second quarter call, a shift in the timing of shortage recognition informed by June physical inventory counts. The third quarter shortage impact and our annual shortage assumption remained materially unchanged from our prior expectations. Compared to last year, delivery expense as a percent of net sales improved 50 basis points primarily reflecting improvement in merchandise allocations resulting in reductions in packagings for orders and distance traveled. This work is closely tied to the third value creation lever, inventory productivity. Our supply chain is flowing smoothly. -- end-of-quarter inventory was down 6% year-over-year and down 17% versus 2019, inclusive of the typical seasonal build for Holiday. Trailing 12-month inventory turn was up 1% to last year. Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&A of $2 billion declined $48 million or 2% from prior year. SG&A dollars benefited from our commitment to ongoing expense discipline versus our prior expectations, SG&A dollars were favorable due to a roughly $10 million timing shift of certain previously forecasted expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percent of total revenue was 40.5%, 230 basis points higher than last year, reflective of the year-over-year decline in sales. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.21 versus $0.52 last year, benefiting from better-than-expected sales, gross margin and SG&A rates, improved interest expense and a low tax rate. The shift in timing of $10 million of SG&A expenses, combined with the lower interest expense and tax rate contributed roughly $0.10 to EPS versus our prior expectations.Lastly, the fifth value creation lever, capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated $158 million of operating cash flow versus $488 million last year, had $749 million of capital expenditures, free cash flow inclusive of proceeds from real estate with an outflow of $555 million, and we have paid $135 million in dividends. Liquidity and a healthy balance sheet remain top priorities. We continue to deploy capital prudently to ensure financial flexibility and to invest in long-term growth.Now let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year outlooks. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales of $7.95 billion to $8.25 billion, including the 53rd week. Our sales outlook reflects our confidence in Macy's, Inc. as a gift-giving destination, including the expected increase in beauty sales penetration, particularly fragrances. Gross margin rate to be at least 220 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we experienced higher markdowns and promotions as we took actions to respond to the heightened competitive environment. Our gross margin outlook gives us the latitude to respond to changes in the promotional landscape.Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85 to $2.10, which takes into account the previously discussed $10 million shift in timing of certain SG&A expenses into the fourth quarter as well as an incremental $15 million of combined investments in marketing and our growth vectors. Together, these items are anticipated to impact fourth quarter EPS by $0.07. End of quarter inventory is roughly flat to last year and down approximately 18% to 2019. Inventories reflect a higher penetration of transitional and seasonal merchandise relative to last year and a build in our reimagined private brand portfolio and the anticipated closure of less than 10 locations in early 2024. Taking into account third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook, this brings our full year expectations to net sales of $22.9 billion to $23.2 billion, a comparable sales decline on a 52-week owned plus licensed basis of 6% to 7%. Other revenue to be about 3.2% of net sales with credit currency revenues accounting for roughly 81%. A gross margin rate of 38.4% to 38.5%. SG&A as a percent of total revenue to be about 35.2% to 35.5% or 36.4% to 36.6% as a percent of net sales. Asset sale gains of approximately $45 million.Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 8.9% to 9.1% or 9.1% to 9.4% as a percent of net sales and interest expense of approximately $140 million. After interest and taxes, we are narrowing our annual adjusted diluted EPS outlook to $2.88 to $3.13 which includes an updated annual diluted share expectation of 278 million shares. As we position for sales growth next year and beyond, our decisions are centered on our customer. We must deliver relevant products, strong value and a more enjoyable shopping experience from optimizing our physical footprint, to providing compelling experiences across channels, to modernizing technology, to driving efficiencies, to automating personalized offers and communications, we are committed to bringing more inspiration on a daily basis to our customers. We look forward to sharing more on how that ladders to long-term profitable growth on our fourth quarter call. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Jeff, one last time."", 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""Thank you, Adrian. Before turning to Q&A, I would like to comment on my 7 years as CEO. While I did not achieve everything I had set out to accomplish, I am proud of my contributions. We exited the pandemic, a healthier and more agile company, leaning into data-driven tools and processes to guide a renewed focus on expense and inventory disciplines. In addition, we significantly improved the health of our balance sheet, paid down debt, pushed out material debt maturities to 2027 and extended the term of our asset-based credit facility. We invested in our colleagues across the company and strengthened our culture of inclusivity. We introduced our social purpose platform, Mission Every One directing $5 billion through 2025 to partners, products, people and programs that help create a more equitable and sustainable future. We also reached 99% pay equity across gender and race and launched S.P.U.R. Pathways which provides funding to diverse owned and underrepresented businesses. And we have a very committed leadership team with strong continuity shifting to Tony, who is ready to lead Macy's, Inc. to profitable sales growth. I would like to thank the Board of Directors for their guidance and support, our senior management team for their leadership and dedication and our colleagues across stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. It has been an honor to work with such a talented team. I am confident the foundation is in place to build on Macy's legacy as a cornerstone of American culture and style. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan."", 'Matthew Robert Boss', ""Sorry to see you go, Jeff, and congrats, Tony. So maybe Tony, can you elaborate on the scale opportunity that you've cited from the portfolio approach maybe how you see your 3 nameplates positioned in the Holiday and also the ability for them to drive the low single-digit growth next year? And then Adrian, could you outline fourth quarter gross margin drivers and just how best to think about gross margin opportunity multiyear?"", 'Antony Spring', ""Thanks, Matt, for the question. We remain excited about the power of the Macy's Inc. portfolio. Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury are 3 of the most important names in retail. We speak to 40 million customers at Macy's 4 million customers of Bloomingdale's and upwards of 1 million customers at Bluemercury. Between the 3 nameplates, we offer a range of price points from off-price to luxury. This year, we're excited about the gift assortments at all 3 nameplates. The improvement in our gift-giving assortments in the Beauty & Fragrance area at Macy's, the expansion of cosmetics and Cashmere, the expansion of toys with our celebration of Disney's 100th anniversary and the opportunity that we see in fine and fashion jewelry with the expansion of Pandora. At Bloomingdale's, we've partnered with Wonka to do an incredible Carousel in 59th Street and online as well as expand our gift assortment across the entire chain. And finally, Bluemercury, our new product type store in New Canaan, Connecticut, I think, sets the standard for what upscale beauty retailing can be in the future. With regard to 2024, we'll talk more about that on the fourth quarter call, but I would only remind the group that we're in the early innings on our 5 growth vectors, and we see plenty of opportunity across each and every one of them."", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""Matt, the first thing we would say on gross margin is that as we think about the risk and opportunities in the fourth quarter, that's reflected in our outlook. And as you know, we've done a lot of work the last several years around this topic of gross margin, whether it be the composition of our assortment, the focus on delivering value or even improving our shopping experience. What's most encouraging going into the fourth quarter is how we think about our inventory. So we start the fourth quarter in a solid inventory position, inventory down 6% year-over-year, down 17% to 2019. Now as we think about kind of where we are with regards to gross margin, we're controlling what we can control. We recognize that the consumer is under pressure. We recognize that there's uncertainty in the environment that we're operating in. We recognize that there's pressure on discretionary, but from our perspective, we have a lot of optionality. We have the ability to adjust. We have flexibility. As we think about the transition from the fourth quarter to next year, the thing that we feel good about is that we have a seasonally appropriate target ending in the fourth quarter. We expect to be about flat to last year but down approximately 18% to 2019. So we're very focused on gross margin. We're very focused on profitability and looking forward to the holiday season."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.', 'Oliver Chen', ""And team, congrats Jeff. It's been great working with you. Congratulations on what's next. So I would love your thoughts, Jeff and Adrian on what's happening with the consumer and also traffic has been pretty bumpy as we look across the sector and many positives and negatives with the health of the consumer, would love your thoughts there. And then, Tony, as we look ahead, which areas of the product assortment do you think have the greatest opportunity are you less excited about? Then Adrian regarding the credit card trends that you're seeing, higher bad debt assumptions and delinquency rates were as you expected. Have trends stabilized here? What should we know about your expectations ahead with those assumptions as well?"", 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""Oliver. I think it's really, as we've talked about with the consumers. So very uncertain times, the consumer is still under pressure, that is nothing new on that. We're reading and monitoring the same signals that you are. The consumers are dealing with many of the same headwinds we've been talking about. There's some additional ones. Student loan repayments, obviously, is one rising interest rate in that environment, some geopolitical issues. But all that's baked into our guidance. And we've been clear on that really for the last number of quarters. So we do expect that the consumer is under pressure. They are, in some cases, continue to shift into experiences and away from our discretionary categories. But because of the broad bandwidth, the customers we serve, what Tony talked about earlier, when you look at kind of off-price or luxury, we have lots of categories, and we're getting more categories when you think about what we're building in our prowess with marketplace. So the big thing that is going to enable all that is our liquidity and really where the -- where inventory is right now. We're obviously controlling that well. We're controlling gross margin well. We really had the opportunity and the liquidity to jump on trends and expect us to continue to do that."", 'Antony Spring', ""Oliver, an answer to your question about the categories. The piece that I love about department store retailing is that we can shift to where the customer is going. And while I certainly love the Beauty and Fragrance business this time of the year because it adds 300 points of penetration to the Macy's business or accentuates the power of Bluemercury or the Luxury Fragrance business at Bloomingdale's. I embrace all the categories. And the reality is if we do a good job as a leadership team, we have the agility to move inventory, move marketing, move web exposure, move presentation in stores to the businesses that are trending best. You've certainly heard us talk with confidence about our opportunities in private brands. We're in the early stages of a Reimagination, pleased with the growth of On 34th Street in its first few months, the Reimagination of INC and more to come, but we also love market brands. We want to be the best partner out there to the retail community. And so we're going to be flexible in our financial models. We're going to keep pursuing our go-get list of brands that we want to be a part of Macy's, Bloomingdale's or Bluemercury and expect that we will have the brands and the products that customers expect from each of these 3 nameplates."", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""And however, just to close out on credit card, no changes with regards to credit card. We spoke on our last earnings call about our outlook for the balance of the year and Q3 was very much in line with our expectations. And as we think about Q4, very much in line with our expectations. As we think about what this means into next year, there's just a number of unknowns that remain out there. And as we get a better sense as to what's happening with the Bureau's decision on late fees and a number of those other factors, we'll share more of a perspective on 2024 and beyond."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.', 'Brooke Siler Roach', ""I wanted to follow up on Oliver's question about the consumer and get your thoughts on what you're seeing from consumer discretionary demand across income cohorts relative to what we saw a few months ago. Have there been any changes in conversion or traffic across each of these cohorts? And how is that driving your strategy for the holiday season? And then as a follow-up, Adrian, can you provide your updated thoughts on the levers that you can pull to protect profitability and EBITDA dollar generation next year if the macro backdrop or credit outlook weakens further."", 'Antony Spring', ""Thank you, Brook, for the question. I think the consumer remains under pressure. We know the discretionary categories remain challenging. And yet as a modern department store, we have the ability to be in multi-brand and multi-category, multichannel and cater in off-price all the way to luxury with content the customer is interested in. And certainly, the gift-giving period, even in a year where discretionary categories are more challenged. This is the time of year where they come to life. Gift Giving Christmas, Coins on Hanukkah they still come and our stores and our sites and our teams are prepared for the holiday with 26% less aged inventory this year, and I think a refreshed assortment of content across all 3 nameplates. There's no doubt that there's a normalization happening in the luxury sector and answer to your point about the different income brackets. However, we believe in luxury long term. And I think the opportunity is there even in a challenged environment for each of our brands to capture more points of distribution. Adrian?"", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""Thanks, Tony. Brook, really good question as it relates to 2024. We remain committed to low single-digit growth beginning next year and also low double-digit EBITDA margin over time. Right now, we're controlling what we can control. We're working to maintain a healthy balance sheet. We're putting in place more and more operating disciplines around inventory management, expense management, we're investing in our growth vectors and investing in the fourth quarter in our growth vectors as we move from testing to scaling in 2024. As we stand here today on this call, the primary headwind to achieving low double-digit EBITDA in 2024 is really around credit card revenues, inclusive of the pending credit card late fee ruling that still has not been released but our fundamentals remain intact. We're excited about what we're seeing with our growth levers, the development and scaling of that is on track, and that's why we're leaning into some additional investments in the fourth quarter. We're encouraged."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Ashley Helgans of Jefferies.', 'Ashley Elizabeth Helgans', ""To start we're just curious what kind of promotional levels you're embedding in the fourth quarter guide? I know you mentioned the guide gave you some flexibility to respond to the promotional environment. And then also, we wanted to ask about your expectations for holiday shopping cadence this year with more pressure on the consumer and higher rates, do you expect to be able to shop closer to holiday than they have in the past couple of years?"", 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""Actually, let me take the second part of your question, and I'll throw the first part to Tony. So when you look at the pace of our -- of the holiday shopper clearly next week and the following week are really critical. So when you think about Black Friday, the competitive landscape has really shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. We're in the midst of that along with our competitors. Customers are taking advantage of that but there is a [pilgrimage] that goes to brick-and-mortar in our sites for Black Friday and that full weekend. We're well ready for that. And in Cyber Week obviously, starting with Cyber Sunday, Cyber Monday, really important. Then we go into a 10-day or so low which is very typical. We're ready for that in terms of where customers are resetting. We're resetting for the last 10 days. That's a really important time frame for us. .And one thing that sets up well for all retailers is that full weekend before Christmas with Christmas dropping to a Monday. So we -- all that is anticipated I think the big thing that you're going to see is really powerful assortments across all 3 of our brands as well as the really focus on simplified values and how we're communicating that. So we are well ready."", 'Antony Spring', ""And I would add to Jeff's comments that the benefit of being a department store again, is that we can handle the range of these cycles. I'm 36 years into this, and I haven't known the fourth quarter that isn't competitive and isn't promotional. That being said, our guidance and margin gives us the opportunity to offer compelling value to have a strong Black Friday and take advantage of, as Jeff described, the extra days in front of the Christmas holiday season. Our website is prepared to deliver on time. Our gift guides have got a nice range of products and price points that I think show compelling value as well as the degree of newness that we just didn't have last year."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Michael Binetti of Evercore ISI.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""Jeff, congrats on the retirement. It's been a pleasure. And Tony, we very much look forward to working with you ahead. I guess, Adrian, just to clarify one thing, the low single-digit sales growth that's referencing net sales for next year, I'm assuming you're excluding the other revenue line because of credit. But if that's true, could you -- would you mind just helping us think even if at a high level through the contributors that you see between comps, new store contribution, new store productivity, I know we have small-format stores coming on, smaller but more productive. You mentioned some store closures. So maybe just a little even qualitatively, what some of the contributions we should think about are? And then I'm curious about the SG&A leverage point as you think ahead to next year based on some of the qualitative comments you gave to Brook there. You guys have really hustled and taken out a lot of costs, you found a lot of efficiency. Obviously, the magnitude of sales declines this year has made SG&A deleverage point. But maybe help us through this, think through scenarios if comps are slightly negative next year versus slightly positive next year. Is there a point that you feel comfortable saying SG&A can leverage in a couple of scenarios next year?"", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""Mike, as it relates to growth, we've been pretty consistent with our investments in our core business and our growth levers. And what Tony talked about a little bit earlier, is really the scaling and maturation of a lot of those growth vectors. So when you think about small format stores, you think about growing our core business, you think about the health of our different channels, it's all focused on better shopping experience, value for the consumer and continuing to strengthen our assortment. Those are the things that give us confidence about growth next year, and we'll certainly share the composition of that as we get into 2024 in the Q4 earnings call.Expense discipline is always a top focus for us. We spoke earlier this year to the $200 million of capturability in 2023 that's about $300 million to $350 million in 2024. SG&A leverage is just a good retail business. So expense discipline is really important for us. we're continuing to lean into opportunities to drive greater productivity within the business. And that's what will lead for us to a double-digit EBITDA profile over time."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.', 'Arian Razai', ""This is Arian Razai for Bob Drbul. Jeff, it was a pleasure working with you. Adrian, can you please speak to units. We've been hearing that the industry units have been trending down low single digits. Do you see any reduction in the average basket? Just wanted to hear your thoughts. And if I may, on the broader consumer health, what are the expectations for tourist traffic for the holidays? Are there any sequential improvement embedded in the guidance?"", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""Yes. As we think about units, what we saw was in the fourth -- in the third quarter, AUR was up mid-single digits, sales down. So obviously, we would expect our unit volume to actually be down. As you think about the consumer, we think the consumer is -- remains under pressure, and I think most importantly, the consumer is discerning. No change in what we've spoken to about the consumer. We expect that to extend into next year, but we do expect the consumer to continue to be challenged."", 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""Let me take your tourism question. So when you look at kind of -- you look at tourism domestically and international, let's talk about international. It just continues to be below 2019 levels. Q3, we did see an uptick, which was encouraging, particularly in Latin and Central America, some countries in Europe, that has benefited our downtown stores when you think about the kind of tourist destinations, some of these downtown metro cities because our flagships did outperform the fleet in Q3. But we're not anticipating a meaningful benefit for the balance of this year. And we're hopeful that we've always talked about the fact that with tourism being 3-plus percent of our overall business international tourism that we will -- that will be a tailwind. So we do expect an uptick in '24 and beyond there."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Charles Grom of Gordon Haskett.', 'Greg Sommer', 'This is Greg Sommer on for Chuck. I was hoping if you could just provide any color on if you saw any variability in the quarter as we saw like warmer pockets of weather around the country or even as student loans kicked off when the repayments restarted?', 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""Yes. When I said just on overall common sales and profit in Q2. It was better than our expectations. So we were strategic with our promotions. That definitely helped us drive conversion. We're not commenting on kind of the monthly performance, but the overall quarter performed better than expectations. I think the main point is that we're definitely ready for holiday. And we're confident in our curated offering, strong value that we're going to be providing the customer So pleased with the quality of the assortment as Tony and Adrian and both spoke to are building flexibility to respond to other customer signals. And that inventory position that we have and our commitment to really staying liquid to respond to the changing customer behavior across all of our categories and price points is going to be critical."", 'Antony Spring', ""And I would just add that the work the team has done to have more transitional products. And even in a quarter where the weather was a little warmer than we would have liked, we saw a great sweater selling. So that's one of the things we've come to accept is we don't control the weather, but we can diversify our assortment to take advantage of opportunities for gift-giving and self-purchase."", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""The only other thing I would add is to your question about student loan repayments, it's really difficult to determine the specific impacts due to student loan payments. But as we think about the 2023 outlook for the balance of the year and the fourth quarter, that's very much reflected in our outlook. And also incorporates the variable of student loans. This would be a pretty important consideration as we get into 2024 as well, but we're just continuing to monitor it pretty closely."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.', 'Alexandra Ann Straton', ""Perfect. And Jeff, congrats on a great career at Macy's. It's been great getting to work with you. Really just a couple for me. First, I think you highlighted Backstage and Bloomie's outlet as outperforming the full line this quarter. I'm just wondering, has that been the case for some time? Or was there some sort of step change this quarter that you'd highlight as well as just how you're thinking about those banners heading into holiday. And then secondly, many wholesalers have trimmed their order book outlook from 3 months ago in their latest earnings reports citing weaker partner orders. Is there anything you can share even qualitative on how you're ordering or thinking about the front half inventory buys."", 'Antony Spring', ""Thanks, Alex, for the question. We feel good about the business at both Backstage and Bloomingdale's outlets. There isn't a quarterly change because they've been performing all year long. I think it speaks to the value-conscious consumer. And we're glad that we have both of these nameplates having an offering in the sector. In the case of Backstage, it's inside of our four wall stores, and we know that the Backstage customer also a full-line customer. So bringing them in for value, it gives us the opportunity. Certainly, as you look at the fourth quarter, to sell them other gifts in size and color and breadth and variety that we wouldn't have necessarily in a freestanding store. And conversely, at Bloomingdale's, you're providing access to a brand that I think is on the upswing. And there is still a consumer, I think that at times is price sensitive. So how do we cater to that customer and ultimately bring them over to the full-price brand at the appropriate point in time. So we feel good about both Backstage and Bloomingdale's lower price.Just, I guess, in follow-up to the second part of your question, we intend to be the better wholesale partner out there. And when I say wholesale partner, that doesn't mean that we won't have a concession relationship, a consignment relationship or hybrid relationship, our objective is to have the best relationship. We don't view it as a zero-sum game. And while there are going to be times where we are adding orders and canceling orders, we try to do it with great transparency. And what I found is our partners appreciate our willingness to forecast with them and talk about our future objectives. As Adrian said, our commitment is to get the low single-digit growth next year, which means we need brand partners in the wholesale market we're betting on both bases in Bloomingdale's."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""And Jeff, best of luck. As you think about Tony and Adrian, the opportunities on the real estate side, you've obviously had some -- a small -- a short time period of the small-format stores but as you think of the landscape opportunity for Bloomingdale's and for Macy's and what the assortment could look like, how do you envision it? What does it mean for margins? And just in the near term, as you think about the first half of 2024, does the cadence of orders or how you're thinking about the ordering patterns, do they change at all from the back half of 2023?"", 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""Yes. Let me take the first part of your question, which would be on the real estate side. So obviously, Dana, we look at our portfolio very closely. And what's the value to operate in a particular unit, what's the monetization opportunity with that? The thing that you're hearing from us is really taking a full market view and really looking at all of our assets that serve customers in the market, and that's our digital assets, our mall-based assets as well as this emerging opportunity that we see in small-door format. So when you look at the Macy's brand is in 49 of the top 50 metro markets. So from that perspective, we're well placed. There's always opportunities to look at individual units and expect that we'll continue to do that. So when you think about when we announced the Polaris strategy, we announced [how many] door closures? We've closed 8 of those. And you've also heard that what we're doing in the small-door format on the Macy's side, we've opened 12 through the fourth quarter of this year. Then intent is to open up to 30 by the end of '25. Very excited about what Bloomie's is doing. So if you think about Bloomie's, Bloomie's is in a substantially less number of the major metro markets in the country. And we just hit a milestone in the last week by opening Bloomie's in Seattle and pleased to say that, that has gotten off to a great start. So there is opportunities in bring in order, but coupled with our products in digital to be able to create 2 powerhouse national omnichannel brands that really span the level of price points and customers and categories that we continue to traffic in."", 'Antony Spring', ""And let me add, obviously, I have a soft spot for Bloomingdale's. So I believe there's growth opportunity digitally, physically in both small-format stores and in our off-price division. As Jeff mentioned, we cover a fraction of the country, but we're going to be surgical in how we expand. We've done too good a job, I think, in having a highly productive portfolio of stores to sacrifice that now.Expect also that we're going to continue to lean into the opportunity to expand margin. That is both in the pricing science as well as in the mix of products that we sell. Sometimes I think AUR gets mistaken for charging the customer more. I just want to emphasize, we will be competitive on price, but we will look for opportunities to expand our AUR and expand our margin through the mix of categories and the types of products that we sell. Remember, we're in the early stages of new order at Macy's. We've seen the margin expansion that we enjoyed at Bloomingdale's through having greater visibility to our assortment through assortment visualization."", 'Dana Lauren Telsey', 'Got it. And then ordering patterns as you think about it for the first half of the year?', 'Jeffrey Gennette', ""So Dana, we're not commenting on the ordering patterns of next year. But what I would say, I want to emphasize one thing that Tony brought up, which was the level of transition that we're having. The balance is our assortments in seasonless content I think when we were looking back at the first quarter of '24, we ran out of cold weather units faster than we should have. And so we commented about that on our first quarter call. Obviously, that comes with getting the right receipt in the fourth quarter, carrying the right level of units in all cold weather categories, transitional categories, for the warmer parts of the country. I think the team has done a good job on that this year, and that should be a nice tailwind for us going into the 2024 time -- in terms of the content of rest of the orders, stay tuned for the fourth quarter call where we will review all that detail."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Gaby Carbone of Deutsche Bank.', 'Gabriella Olivia Carbone', 'Congratulations, Jeff. So you just touched on this a bit, but I was wondering if you can dig into the potential levers that you have for additional improvement in the gross margin rate as you look to next year. If you could maybe walk us through the biggest buckets there, that would be helpful.', 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""So I'll comment on a few things. Even though we haven't shared the gross margin outlook for next year, as Tony pointed out, it's a big focus for us. the one discipline that will not go away is our discipline on inventory management. And that has been very helpful to us in terms of margin expansion with our pricing science, our discipline on having less markdowns than what we had prepandemic. So that will continue to be a strength for us. As Tony talked about, there are other opportunities around mix, there are other opportunities around how we manage our delivery expense. There are just a number of initiatives that we're going after to increase our retail margin, reduce our delivery expense and ultimately increase our gross margin but it starts with inventory discipline and working capital discipline on that balance sheet and then making good choices about our assortment and managing the flow of those goods while so that we have solid sell-through unit velocity in all of our channels."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.', 'Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson', ""You've done a great job of managing the expense structure. Adrian, I was just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit on the $300 million to $350 million of 2024 cost savings, how much of that is slated for reinvestment in your growth vectors?"", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""It's a very good question, Lorraine. The reality is that there are going to be puts and takes. But fundamentally, what we've been focused on is the incremental value from expense management. As we think about the composition of the expense reductions, about 1/3 of it is coming from gross margin expense and the balance of it is really showing up in SG&A but our fundamental focus for next year is around profitable growth. And so we're making investments in our growth vectors in order to accelerate the top line. And so that's a big part of where our investments have been.

I'm wishing you all the best. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the private label push I really like On 34th and excited about the evolution of INC. And I was just wondering what the margin impact of that could be here in late fiscal '23 and as we look forward to fiscal '24. And if it's too early to be asking that, I understand, but I'm just wondering if there's some positive influence coming on the gross margin side from outperformance in private label.And Adrian, on the cost efficiencies you've achieved this year, which have been better than I expected. I know how you just answered Lorraine's question. I'm just wondering how they influence those savings, how those influence fiscal '24 in that -- was there some pull forward of savings in '23 that might impact the opportunity for better-than-expected SG&A next year."", 'Antony Spring', ""Thank you, Jane. Appreciate the question. First, I'm a huge believer in private brands. Private brands have a wonderful heritage in the Macy's brand. Macy's brand has been known over the years for having some of the best private brands, and we're excited, certainly about the performance of On 34th and the refresh of INC and what's to come over the next couple of years. I think the commitment of the team to refresh the entirety of our private brand portfolio with exclusive design, customer influence product and true focus on white space opportunities gives me confidence in our private brand strategy. Private brands are important to Bloomingdale's too with success in both Aqua and Hudson Park. And I think you're right, there is margin opportunity when we scale this particular growth vector. Again, you trade a little liquidity for margin opportunity, and you can expect us to watch that carefully because we love the exclusivity and the natural margin that comes from private brands, but we want to make sure we're always buying the best brands that are available, and we want to leave ourselves that flexibility to make sure that we're adding the appropriate market brands as well. That's what makes Macy's and Bloomingdale's more compelling is when we have the right balance of both private brands and market brands."", 'Adrian V. Mitchell', ""Janet, thanks again for your question. When we think about profitable growth over time, that requires SG&A leverage. And so when we think about the cost efficiencies, they have to be sustainable and they have to be recurring over time. The thesis that we talk a lot about within our business is around simplification and automation. So we're looking at our processes all over the business to really take out complexity, put in new ways of working, placing an automation where it makes sense. The strength of our foundation is based on the simplification of our core so what we are continuing to lean into is simplify the business, which will remove the headwinds for growth. So that's how we're approaching our cost efficiencies over time with the ambition over time of achieving SG&A leverage."", 'Operator', 'That brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Tony Spring for closing comments.', 'Antony Spring', ""Thanks everybody, for joining us on the third quarter call today. We want to take this opportunity to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving, and we hope you'll join us all in watching work, joining us in person at the Thanksgiving Day Parade next week.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Masco’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Masco ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.1% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Masco today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $64.71, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Masco’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Masco's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MAS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MAS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you'd like to know more about Masco as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

COP28 will deliver the first completed global stocktake of the world's progress toward meeting climate goals. Key findings include an implementation gap, with countries falling short of their targets, and an emissions ambition gap recognizing that current targets fall far short of the needed levels of commitments to reach Paris goals."", 'Saugata Saha, president, S&P Global Commodity Insights, said, ""Given the competing geopolitical, economic, and financial pressures – and increasingly domestic-oriented policy directions – a key success at COP28 will be all countries taking part and remaining around the negotiating table. A good result beyond participation would be the build-up of trust, cooperation on sharing technologies, opening channels for needed capital flows, and bridging the North-South divide to solve the Energy Trilemma of affordability, security, and sustainability.""', 'To help understand the challenges to reaching the emissions targets, experts at\xa0S&P Global Commodity Insights have developed three plausible scenarios and two net-zero cases extending to 2050 and featuring in-depth coverage of trends in oil, gas, coal, power, renewables, emissions and hydrogen markets at the global, regional and country levels:', ""S&P Global Commodity Insights' base case – or 'Inflections' scenario, projects transformative change that would result in a reduction in fossil fuels' share of total energy demand from the present 80% to 58% and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions dropping 25% from today's levels by 2050. This brings global warming to about 2.4 degrees Celsius, which is short of what is needed to achieve Paris Agreement goals."", ""An aggressive decarbonization – or 'Green Rules' scenario includes revolutionary transformation toward a sustainable low-carbon economy but does not reach net-zero emissions until 2085, and sees average global temperatures rise of 1.7 degrees Celsius by 2100. It envisions more efficient energy use and fossil fuels dropping to less than 40% of total energy demand and total emissions falling nearly 60% from today's levels."", ""A 'Discord' scenario foresees a world fractured by successive crises that cause long-term damage to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, with rising costs creating uncertainty, hindering investment, and causing market volatility. This scenario expects higher reliance on fossil energy with significant GHG emissions and a warming by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100."", ""The results of S&P Global Commodity Insights' scenarios work indicate that the world still needs to innovate toward commercially viable technologies to bring net-zero within reach. The chart below provides a sense of the emissions paths of the different scenarios (including the two net zero cases) and the shortfalls as compared to NDC goals and net zero targets. However, what happens at COP can impact the trajectories. Watch for signposts across a number of key themes.\xa0 "", 'S&P Global Commodity Insights\xa0Eight Key Themes to Watch at COP28:', ""Emissions mitigation targets are off track. The first global stocktake report found that the current emissions reduction targets that countries have established, as part of their commitments under the Paris Agreement, are insufficient to meet the overarching goal of the Agreement to ideally limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights' global stocktake analysis, the current ambitions would result in GHG emissions levels almost double those that are needed to keep the world on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 1.5-degree-Celsius trajectory. Whether countries respond with more aggressive plans and conviction will be key."", 'Language around a phase out of fossil fuels to be a key negotiating point. The European Union has announced that it will be bringing a proposal to phase out unabated fossil fuel use to COP28. If countries agree to such a pledge, expect debate regarding the exact language used. Key terms to watch will be ""phase down"" versus ""phase out"" and ""unabated"" versus ""all.""', 'Success to hinge on negotiations around financing from developed nations. In 2009, developed nations pledged $100 billion a year to developing nations for climate mitigation and adaptation, to be met in 2020. That goal was not met until 2023 and is well below what developing nations have indicated is necessary for them to meet their most aggressive climate-related targets. Negotiators will work this year on developing a post-2025 finance goal, but continued disagreement between developing and developed nations will put the ability and willingness of developing nations to scale up climate mitigation efforts at risk.', 'Expect a focus on industry-led solutions and low-carbon innovation. One of the United Arab Emirates\' key goals for COP28 is a tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030 globally, a target in line with the S&P Global Commodity Insights Aggressive Decarbonization scenario but out of range in the base case Inflections scenario. Methane is likely to be another key action area as the COP28 president-designate has called on the oil and gas industry to ""eliminate methane emissions by 2030."" Technology around carbon management and carbon capture is expected to feature in discussions, with hydrogen solutions expected to attract significant attention.', ""Developed and developing nation differences slow progress on Loss & Damage and adaptation. After an historic agreement at last year's COP27 on developing a funding mechanism for loss and damage, developed and developing nations have not agreed on the location, legal status, fund contributors, or allocation of the fund's resources. This has brought the operationalization of the fund into question. In early November, negotiators struck a tentative deal on the structure of the fund, which could be proposed and adopted at COP28. However, the proposal contains contentious elements, which have yet to be resolved, slowed further by a divide between nations about the use of targets and metrics."", 'Opportunity for further progress on operationalizing Paris Agreement Article 6. COP26 saw the finalization of the Paris Agreement Article 6 rulebook for international funding and accounting of carbon emissions reductions across borders. This next step is necessary to drive greater reductions at lower costs to achieve and go beyond nationally determined contributions (NDC) targets. The Article 6.4 Supervisory Board is tasked with addressing technical details (e.g., methodologies for crediting and inclusion of carbon removals), and recommendations from this Board are expected to be presented for formal adoption at COP28. With the Voluntary Carbon Market under increased scrutiny, policymakers want to ensure that the UN rules avoid unnecessary pitfalls.', 'Reform of multilateral development banks and the role of private sector investment in financing the energy sector transition remains a key topic of discussion. As multilateral development banks undergo a period of structural reform, questions remain regarding their role in financing the energy transition in developing nations. Project developers will watch to see if these banks will be able to change their mandates to drive additional investment to the developing nations and whether reform can create a structure to crowd-in private sector investment.', 'COP has become a proxy for other issues and relations restoration. Using climate as a proxy, nations in recent years have used these meetings to establish positions and leverage negotiations on other topics. For example, climate action has been an area that the United States and China have found common ground even when publicly at odds on other geopolitical issues.

It went public in March of 2021, and we have been investors in this Fund since the IPO. After spending half a day with management, touring the company’s fulfillment center, asking questions, and learning more about the reasons behind the remarkable success the company has achieved over the last 13 years, we decided we wanted to own it in this Fund as well. When we originally invested in Coupang, our thesis was constructed around the company’s wide product selection, low prices, and unrivaled convenience thanks to its investments in an end-to-end infrastructure that covers over 70% of Korea’s population, enabling over 99% of orders to be delivered within one day or less, rather than the industry norm of two to three days, driving customer satisfaction, which translates to higher customer retention rates and lifetime value. We thought that Coupang would continue to gain market share in the U.S. $500 billion-plus Korean retail market, while expanding its offerings into additional categories, expanding its ecosystem via a third-party marketplace, and continuing to invest in infrastructure density to further capture inefficiencies, enhancing the customer experience, and improving profit margins. The company has since outperformed our expectations, growing its market share to 25% (#1 in the industry), despite not being a first mover, while building an unrivaled user experience with 99.8% of products delivered the next day (with the majority of them by dawn) and becoming profitable significantly faster than we expected. Our biggest takeaway from the visit was that despite all of Coupang’s success, there is still a long runway of growth ahead. For example, while most of the facility we visited is operated with pickers going to shelves to pick up items for orders, there was one room in which shelves drove themselves to pickers on the back of autonomous robots, which increased picker productivity by 3x. Additionally, while Coupang has been striving to reduce its reliance on distributors, which enables them to expand margins while lowering prices for consumers, a significant opportunity remains for further reduction. Lastly, we got plenty of examples of out-of-the-box thinking (no pun intended) from the company’s singulation process (improves the picking process by reducing the constraint to search for items order by order), decreasing use of boxes (80% of shipments are now boxless), enabling grocery delivery without cold-chain logistics (thanks to end-to-end supplychain efficiency), or how Coupang is able to fill trucks so that each carries more than 2x the parcels a UPS or a FedEx truck can, despite being half the size. The 4% free-cash-flow yield, which is also negatively impacted by the significant reinvestments the company is making into its emerging offerings, also contributed to our decision to add to our Coupang position upon returning to New York.""', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62', 'Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:', '“Intercontinental Exchange was founded in the year 2000 after Western Power Group executive Jeff Sprecher bought Continental Power Exchange from MidAmerican Energy for $1. Sprecher made the acquisition because he recognized that the deregulation of the electric power industry in the United States had opened a market for surplus energy to be traded between power plants. Using eBay as a model, Sprecher aimed to develop a transparent marketplace for over-the-counter energy trading. Acquisitions of International Petroleum Exchange, New York Board of Trade, Creditex, Climate Exchange, NYSE Euronext, Interactive Data Corporation, and Ellie Mae followed, with the commonalities of successful acquisition consisting of small companies early in their growth trajectory that could be scaled on ICE’s platform, and large mature companies where ICE’s technological and operating expertise could reinvigorate and scale their growth trajectory.', 'Today, Intercontinental Exchange is a transactional marketplace and subscription database business with global scale. Entrenched network effects in a wide range of asset class marketplaces provide a platform from which ICE usesits technology and operating expertise to layer on growth opportunities. After applying digital technology to increase the efficiency of marketplaces, ICE rolls out new innovations on top of its scalable infrastructure. Core competencies in collecting and cleansing unstructured data to build databases enforce ICE’s ability to capture the data exhaust from its marketplaces to provide recurring subscription-based revenue streams.“Additionally, we initiated a position in Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE) (U.S.) during the quarter. Intercontinental Exchange is one of the largest and most successful financial exchange operators. The company was created through a series of shrewd acquisitions under founder and CEO Jeff Sprecher. We believe Sprecher is an excellent CEO with a history of astute capital allocation and an ability to adapt to opportunities and competitive threats. Today, Intercontinental Exchange competes in three primary segments: exchanges, fixed income/data services and mortgage technology. We believe each of these businesses exhibits attractive economic characteristics and will grow earnings faster than GDP over time. Investors today are concerned about Intercontinental Exchange’s mortgage segment as rising interest rates have depressed origination volumes. We agree that this segment will be pressured in the near term. However, only 7% of trailing 12-month revenues are sensitive to mortgage volumes, and we believe they will eventually revert to historical norms. Today, however, Intercontinental Exchange sells for what we believe is an underserved discount to its exchange peers and private market valuations.”', 'Click to continue reading and see Jacob Rothschild Stock Portfolio: 5 Top Stock Picks', 'Suggested Articles:', '20 Countries with the Best Education', '30 Cities with the Best Education System in the World', '10 Best Education Stocks To Buy In 2023', 'Disclosure.

And while his sports endeavors are all that the media can talk about these days, Appaloosa Management has been quietly humming like a well oiled machine on the sidelines. Mr. Tepper's hedge fund's investment portfolio was worth $5 billion as of Q3 2023, to mark for a small $300 million drop over the second quarter and a sizeable $3.3 billion gain over the third quarter of 2022. While hedge fund portfolios can appreciate in value through the investors adding in more investments, their value can also change in response to market events."", ""Considering the stock market performance during 2023, it's unsurprising that David Tepper's investment portfolio has grown significantly over the course of the past twelve months. This is because while Appaloosa Management focused on junk bonds in its early days, now, some of its biggest investments are in the technology sector. Digging through the firm's third quarter of 2023 SEC filings revealed that its five biggest shareholdings were in the stocks of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Cumulatively, Appaloosa Management's third quarter investments in the five mega cap technology giants were worth roughly $2.4 billion to account for close to half of its investment portfolio. Over the course of the past twelve months, the shares of these five companies have appreciated by 199%, 53%, 51.9%, 215%, and 37.5%, respectively."", ""However, share price appreciation might not be the sole reason why Appaloosa and David Tepper's latest investment portfolio is worth a lot more today than it was a year back. To conclusively determine whether this is the case, we'll have to dig deeper into the firm's recent investment history. Starting from Meta, the hedge fund had owned 875,000 shares of the company in Q3 2022. as of this year's third quarter, it has increased the number of shares to 1.9 million after slowly building the position starting January. This trend also holds for Appaloosa Management's Microsoft and Google investments, and NVIDIA stands out from the rest since David Tepper only started buying its shares during the first quarter of 2023 only to rapidly grow its stake from holding 150,000 shares back then to a much more sizeable 1 million shares as of September 2023."", ""Shifting gears to focus on the stock market environment, November 2023 appears to be the dawn of a new era. This is because multiple economic indicators appear to be pointing at the end of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle to spur hopes that the central bank might even start reducing them soon. The flagship S&P 500 index has gained 9% since late October, and U.S. equity funds seem to be roaring back to life. Data from LSEG shows that during the week ending on November 5th, $9.3 billion flowed into equity funds after inflation data hinted that the Fed might be heading toward a pause. At the same time, treasury yields have come down from their record high levels, and overall, the market appears to be stabilizing."", 'Yet, at the same time, warning signs of a U.S. economic slowdown are also in play. Not only has inflation reduced, but unemployment is also rising and manufacturing appears to be slowing down. This slowdown was also evident to the management of the mega retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), whose management shared in a recent earnings call:', 'We’re in a period of time 12 months after the Fed has begun raising rates. We’ve seen consumer balance sheets that are getting back close to pre-pandemic levels. You’ve got the repayment of student loans, which affects about 27 million Americans. So all of these things could be contributing. I do want to point out, John talked about the impact of weather can have on our business. I’m learning that that can have profound effects in consumer shopping patterns. And we saw anomalous weather in the back half of October. So there is a number of different reasons, we can’t put our finger on is exactly.', 'And so that’s why we take a little bit more of a cautious stance as we go into the fourth quarter, calling out perhaps more variability because there are some trends that have been different than what we saw the first 11 weeks of the quarter. Not to be alarmist, so I think our business is still performing really well. That’s why we called out what we’ve seen thus far in November. In particular, the events that we’ve had. Walmart U.S., some of the more festive events internationally, we’ve seen strong response from our customers. But that this is — this was — the trend we saw in the back half of October was different than anything else we’ve seen this year. And so we simply want to call that out.', 'So, what is smart money thinking as the economic winds start to shift?

If you want to skip our introduction to the well known hedge fund boss, his financial firm, and the broader stock market, then take a look at 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. ', ""Paul Tudor Jones is one of the richest hedge fund investors in the world. He set up his hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 and since then, the fund has grown to be quite sizeable. By the end of this year's third quarter, Tudor Investment's portfolio was worth $9.9 billion, marking a sizeable $1.6 billion growth over the previous quarter. Like other seasoned hedge fund bosses, Mr. Tudor also has gained his fair share of laurels on the stock market. Some of his most well known bets came in 1987 when he bet against both American and Japanese stock markets. The year 1987 is one of the most well known periods in stock market history that is now known as the year in which the Black Monday event took place (on October 19). The stock market crash came after a five year bull run as investors started to fret that valuations were a bit too stretched. This made them place a lot of bets against the market, and due to market closure, when all of these were simultaneously executed, the market crashed."", ""Mr. Tudor was one of those investors who had bet against the market, and as a result, his hedge fund delivered a whopping 125% in gains after fees (some estimates believe Tudor Investment made a cool $100 million). Tudor Investment was not finished timing the market just yet, as it replicated the strategy a couple of years later during a pivotal time during the Asian economic giant Japan's economic history. Japan's economy and infrastructure were destroyed after the second world war, and in order to economically recover, the country relied on lax policy rates and government incentives to stimulate growth. This worked and Japan became one of the fastest growing economies in the world at the time. However, these policy decisions would also face their reckoning in the form of overvaluation in the market that forced the flagship Nikkei 225 index to crash by 43% during a single year. Mr. Tudor and his investment firm successfully predicted this as well, and this led the fund to deliver 87.4% returns in 1990. The firm's last hurrah in predicting the right stock market trends would come at the turn of the millennium when the dot com bubble popped."", ""However, a career in the hedge fund industry is bound to have its ups and downs. For Mr. Tudor, the post 2001 period was particularly muted, especially as the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to the bare minimum. Time has also seen his influence in the hedge fund reduce, as some estimates suggest that as of 2014, he was responsible for 20% of the trading decisions surrounding Tudor Investment's flagship fund, Tudor BVI."", ""Taking a look at Mr. Tudor's time in the industry before he set up his hedge fund, he started his career in the multi billion dollar commodities trading industry. This would help him when he set up Tudor Investment, as Commodities Corporation, which would later become a part of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, was one of the first to provide capital to the hedge fund for investment. Additionally, as opposed to other seasoned financial and hedge fund players who have made their stock market fortunes by value investing, Mr. Tudor is commonly known as a trends player who sees the direction that the market is heading and then places bets to benefit from them."", ""While this approach led to a muted performance by Mr. Tudor and his firm over the past decade, these days it's become more important. This is because interest rates are at record high levels once again, and shifts in commodities industries such as the oil market have become more common due to conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine war in the Middle East. The shifting trends also suggest that Tudor Investment is benefiting from the changes, since its Q3 2023 portfolio of $9.9 billion marks a sizeable growth over its value of $4.6 billion during the year ago quarter."", ""Tudor Investment's investment portfolio has more than doubled over the year, and this makes looking at its latest investments even more important.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', 'During five years of share price growth, Lockheed Martin achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period.

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Lockheed Martin's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Lockheed Martin's TSR for the last 5 years was 72%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Investors in Lockheed Martin had a tough year, with a total loss of 5.1% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 14%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'Lockheed Martin is not the only stock insiders are buying.

At the same time, the adherents of this theory think inflation will continue to ease, enabling the Federal Reserve to meaningfully cut interest rates in 2024.', 'So far, the chances of materializing appear to be quite high, as the Fed expects the economy to grow at a fairly robust, seasonally adjusted annual rate, above inflation, of 2.1% in the current quarter. Meanwhile, inflation is generally heading downwards. The significant decrease in oil prices should push prices further south.

Therefore, a soft-landing scenario that allows the Fed to cut interest rates would probably cause the value of BAC’s bonds to surge. Thus, BAC stock would rally.', 'Currently, BAC’s shares are trading at a substantially low forward P/E ratio of 8.3, largely due to the paper losses of its bonds.

Earlier this year, Bayer executives had said they expect asundexian — one of an emerging class of drugs called Factor XIa inhibitors — to eventually earn in excess of $5 billion in annual sales, making Monday’s trial setback a major blow to the company.', 'Called OCEANIC-AF, the study was evaluating how well asundexian prevents strokes in people with atrial fibrillation, the primary reason people now receive Eliquis or Bayer’s own Xarelto. Companies developing Factor XIa inhibitors believe the drugs can be safer than Factor Xa medicines like Eliquis and Xarelto by reducing the risk of bleeding.', 'Xarelto, which Johnson & Johnson markets in the U.S., arrived on the market before Eliquis, but hasn’t achieved the same annual sales. In clinical trials, Bayer was only able to prove that Xarelto wasn’t inferior to an older drug called warfarin, while Eliquis proved both safer and more effective.', 'Combined, Bayer and Johnson & Johnson reported Xarelto annual sales of about $6 billion in 2022, compared with nearly $12 billion for Eliquis. Both drugs are set to lose patent protection in the middle of the 2020s, however, meaning those sales could be eroded by generic competition. Success with Factor XIa drugs could help the drugmakers offset expected losses from generic Factor Xa drugs.', 'Asundexian was ahead in development of a Bristol Myers Squibb Factor XIa called milvexian, which isn’t set to complete the Phase 3 trials necessary to seek Food and Drug Administration approval until 2026 or 2027.', 'Bayer decided to halt the trial, which began just nine months ago, based on “ongoing surveillance which showed an inferior efficacy of asundexian versus the control arm.” It is an unusually early termination for a Phase 3 study in cardiovascular disease, which typically enrolls tens of thousands of patients and last several years to detect a benefit from new drugs.', 'According to the company, safety results were “consistent” with previously reported trial data.', 'A trial in people who have already experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack will continue, Bayer said. However, the company will reassess a planned study in atrial fibrillation patients who can’t take other oral anticoagulants, which Bayer announced two weeks ago.', 'The trial halt may also raise doubts about the promise of milvexian, which like asundexian reported mixed Phase 2 data in stroke prevention. Bristol Myers shares fell 3% this morning. The company, with its partner J&J, has outlined a major Phase 3 program to prove milvexian’s effectiveness.', 'In a July note to clients initiating coverage on Bristol Myers Squibb, SVB Securities analyst David Risinger described milvexian as the company’s “biggest pipeline opportunity” that could potentially reach more than $5 billion in annual sales, a total company executives also believe is possible.', 'Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a client note that Bayer’s announcement will have “very significant implications” for other companies in the field.', 'Bristol Myers said in an emailed statement that it remains confident in its trial plans and that it believes milvexian is different from other oral Factor XI inhibitors.', 'Editor’s note: This story has been updated with comment from Bristol Myers Squibb.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

However, customer concentration and consolidation in the wireless industry raise concerns for Crown Castle. High interest rates add to its woes.', 'The exponential growth in mobile data usage, higher availability of spectrum and deployment of 5G networks at scale are driving significant network investments by carriers who aim to improve and densify their cell sites. Moreover, wireless data consumption is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet-of-Things and the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services and hybrid-working scenarios.Given Crown Castle’s unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 85,000 route miles of fiber (as of the third quarter of 2023) in the top 100 basic trading areas of the United States, it remains well-positioned to capitalize on this upbeat trend.The company’s investments in fiber and small cell business on the back of acquisitions, constructions and new deployments complement its tower business and offer meaningful upside potential to its 5G growth strategy. It is working on increasing the rate of small cell node deployments this year to 10,000 compared with the 5,000 nodes it put on air in 2022 to meet the growing customer demand. For 2024, it expects to deploy a record 14,000 small-cell nodes. Also, long-term leases with a solid and creditworthy tenant base assure steady revenues.Crown Castle has sufficient liquidity and a decent balance sheet position. The company exited the third quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $117 million. As of Sep 30, 2023, the net debt to last quarter’s annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.4X. It has limited maturities through 2024, with a weighted average term-to-maturity of eight years.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Crown Castle is committed to that. It has increased its dividend five times in the last five years and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 8.66%.Given that the company’s dividends are supported by high-quality, long-term contracted lease payments and that it benefits from being a provider of mission-critical shared communication infrastructure assets, we expect the dividend payout to be sustainable over the long run. Management targets a long-term annual dividend per share growth of 7-8% beyond 2025.Shares of Crown Castle, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have soared 20% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.2%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. As of Sep 30, 2023, around three-fourths of the company’s site rental revenues were derived from T-Mobile (35%), Verizon (19%) and AT&T (20%). The loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line. Particularly, the company’s 2023 and 2024 financial results are likely to be affected as T-Mobile is expected to cancel a part of its tower, small cell and fiber leases over the next few years in relation to the consolidation of a legacy Sprint network.CCI has a substantially leveraged balance sheet and a significant amount of debt relative to its cash flows. The company’s debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $21.9 billion as of Sep 30, 2023. Moreover, in an elevated interest rate environment, additional borrowings to fund near-term capital expenditures will not only inflate the company’s debt but also raise the cost of borrowings.Management expects to incur interest expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs between $834 million and $869 million in 2023. Our estimate indicates a year-over-year rise of 20.4% in the company’s current-year interest expenses. With high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL and STAG Industrial, Inc.

Around the world, companies are devising policies to cut their carbon emissions and adopt more favorable methods including switching their operations to renewable and electric energies. Over time, environmental, social, and governance practices are being implemented widely and firms are allocating a portion of their budgets to ESG activities. Environmental stocks are shares of firms that are focused on sustainability, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other green initiatives.

Outside Europe and North America, Asian regions are also seeing an increase in EV production.

Looking ahead, China maintains its ranking as the biggest market for electric cars with 40% of consolidated sales by 2030, the IEA said.', 'Renewable energy also plays a fundamental role in the global environment.

Contract wins from federal or state authorities also contribute to membership and premium growth. An aging population will continue to keep demand for health insurers’ Medicare plans high in the future. Industry players resort to a merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy and technology advancements to enhance capabilities. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH are well-placed to gain from the industry’s favorable growth prospects.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign health and medical insurance policy premiums. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.', '4 Trends Shaping the Future of the HMO Industry', 'A Growing Premium Base: The industry participants devise affordable health insurance plans and infuse them with some eye-catching features to boost the lucrativeness of such plans and stand out from their peers. By extending such beneficial plans across several U.S. communities, the health insurers enjoy a growing membership base. This, in turn, fetches them with a steady flow of premiums — the most significant contributor to revenues of any health insurer. The strength of these plans fetches numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from federal or state authorities. However, the resumption of elective procedures, which were deferred to keep beds open for a humongous number of COVID patients, in full swing poses a concern for health insurers. An uptick in elective surgeries implies the need to address a higher number of claims from plan members. This would elevate costs, but the financial strength and diversified operations are expected to provide a shield to the industry participants from such headwinds.', 'A Rising Greying Population: The Medicare plans are intended to cater to people aged 65 or above. An aging U.S. population is likely to sustain the solid demand for the plans in the days ahead. Per the leading market and consumer data provider, Statista, around 17.3% of Americans were 65 years or above in 2020. The percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. Industry participants can, therefore, make use of the Medicare plans to welcome more members of the rapidly growing senior population and grow its customer base. They contract with an extensive network of healthcare providers, which can be physician groups, hospitals, ancillary providers, and pharmacies, to deliver quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.', 'Technological Advancements: The industry continues to undertake significant investments in developing virtual healthcare solutions (more commonly referred to as telehealth services) in order to embrace the digitization trend being infused across every sphere of life. These services enable patients to receive care from the comfort of their homes and thereby reduce the mounting burden on the U.S. healthcare system arising from frequent patient admissions. Such technologies, therefore, boost operational efficiencies and reduce costs for the industry participants. Though tech investments might result in escalating costs for health insurers, virtual services continue to fetch regular revenues and enable them to achieve a competitive edge over their peers.', 'An Active M&A Strategy: The health insurers resort to an M&A strategy for upgrading their product and services portfolio that will fetch them a growing number of members. Such initiatives are also meant to expand the global presence and bring diversification benefits to health insurers, which are crucial to strengthening one’s market position. However, continued rate hikes by the Fed in order to tame inflation may have thrown a roadblock to health insurers’ pursuit of an M&A strategy, considering the rising borrowing costs that make people reluctant to opt for loans for financing M&A deals.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Instills Optimism', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the latest stock market news, then take a look at 5 Stocks Billionaire Larry Robbins Just Bought and Sold. ', ""Larry Robbins is one of the more interesting hedge fund bosses in the finance industry. He set up his hedge fund Glenview Capital in 2000, and according to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund had an investment portfolio worth $4.4 billion during the third quarter of this year. This value sees the portfolio stay flat over 2023's June quarter and a $400 million growth over last year's third quarter."", ""Unlike some other hedge funds which loathe uncertainty and seek to divest their holdings at the slightest hint of volatility, Mr. Robbins is known for holding stocks for a long time period. This also means that his fund swings between losses and gains based on the broader trading environment. For instance, in 2008, which was the worst period for the finance industry in 2008, Mr. Robbins' fund lost nearly $4.5 billion in assets. However, over a longer time period, say between 2001 to 2010, the hedge fund posted a whopping 301% net fee return, and after the 2008 hit, it went on to soar 82.7% in 2009."", ""Like others, Mr. Robbins is also a prudent market analyst. Some of his strongest bets came during 2021 when the coronavirus pandemic was raging its devastation. Back then, the billionaire hedge fund owner repeated his strong healthcare investments streak and went on to buy healthcare and travel stocks in 2020. This led to his hedge fund returning 10.3% in 2021 as the healthcare bets paid off with Wall Street piling into them in hopes of a cure for the virus. Healthcare continues to be a favorite Larry Robbins play as of the third quarter of 2023, since his firm's three biggest investments are in healthcare companies. These are Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), and Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS). Cumulatively, they represent roughly a quarter of Glenview Capital's Q3 2023 investment portfolio, as the hedge fund has piled in roughly $1.1 billion in the three companies only."", ""Additionally, Larry Robbins's investing philosophy places him right alongside some of the biggest names in the industry such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. This is because he believes that instead of acting as traders that jump to sell shares as soon as the share price nosedives, Mr. Robbins believes that investors should act more like owners. This involves working closely with company management teams to build relationships and understand the intricate nature of a business to see whether its fundamentals can support hefty share price appreciation in the future."", ""Mr. Robbins' hedge fund, Glenview Capital's investment strategy is also often described as a mix of growth and value investment. The strategy is often dubbed as GARP, an acronym for Growth At a Reasonable Price after an interview he gave to Value Investor Insight Magazine in 2005. This approach has seen the fund target not only healthcare companies but also technology and other firms that it believes have the potential to post share price appreciation in the future while still being modestly priced."", ""Shifting our focus from Larry Robbins to the broader economic environment, right now, it appears that the winds of investing are shifting. This is because inflation has fallen by quite a bit, and the data for October saw major stock indexes soar as investors made bets that the Federal Reserve is done with its interest rate hikes. However, at the same time, some strange events are taking place in the stock market. For those out of the loop, volatility in investing refers to rapid share movement and the index that tracks this volatility is the Cboe Volatility Index also called the VIX. So what's strange about that? Well, data compiled by Reuters shows that nearly a hundred thousand call options with a strike price of 27 closing in January 2024 have been opened. They join other options that were recently opened, and cumulatively, a whopping half a million January call options are in play. Does this mean that some big fish is betting that stocks will go through a sell off and cause the VIX to spike? Not necessarily, as the positions could indicate hedging for other positions."", 'So, as the market breathes and somebody bets that volatility will jump, what stocks is Larry Robbins buying and selling?

If you want to skip our introduction to the well known hedge fund boss, his financial firm, and the broader stock market, then take a look at 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. ', ""Paul Tudor Jones is one of the richest hedge fund investors in the world. He set up his hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 and since then, the fund has grown to be quite sizeable. By the end of this year's third quarter, Tudor Investment's portfolio was worth $9.9 billion, marking a sizeable $1.6 billion growth over the previous quarter. Like other seasoned hedge fund bosses, Mr. Tudor also has gained his fair share of laurels on the stock market. Some of his most well known bets came in 1987 when he bet against both American and Japanese stock markets. The year 1987 is one of the most well known periods in stock market history that is now known as the year in which the Black Monday event took place (on October 19). The stock market crash came after a five year bull run as investors started to fret that valuations were a bit too stretched. This made them place a lot of bets against the market, and due to market closure, when all of these were simultaneously executed, the market crashed."", ""Mr. Tudor was one of those investors who had bet against the market, and as a result, his hedge fund delivered a whopping 125% in gains after fees (some estimates believe Tudor Investment made a cool $100 million). Tudor Investment was not finished timing the market just yet, as it replicated the strategy a couple of years later during a pivotal time during the Asian economic giant Japan's economic history. Japan's economy and infrastructure were destroyed after the second world war, and in order to economically recover, the country relied on lax policy rates and government incentives to stimulate growth. This worked and Japan became one of the fastest growing economies in the world at the time. However, these policy decisions would also face their reckoning in the form of overvaluation in the market that forced the flagship Nikkei 225 index to crash by 43% during a single year. Mr. Tudor and his investment firm successfully predicted this as well, and this led the fund to deliver 87.4% returns in 1990. The firm's last hurrah in predicting the right stock market trends would come at the turn of the millennium when the dot com bubble popped."", ""However, a career in the hedge fund industry is bound to have its ups and downs. For Mr. Tudor, the post 2001 period was particularly muted, especially as the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to the bare minimum. Time has also seen his influence in the hedge fund reduce, as some estimates suggest that as of 2014, he was responsible for 20% of the trading decisions surrounding Tudor Investment's flagship fund, Tudor BVI."", ""Taking a look at Mr. Tudor's time in the industry before he set up his hedge fund, he started his career in the multi billion dollar commodities trading industry. This would help him when he set up Tudor Investment, as Commodities Corporation, which would later become a part of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, was one of the first to provide capital to the hedge fund for investment. Additionally, as opposed to other seasoned financial and hedge fund players who have made their stock market fortunes by value investing, Mr. Tudor is commonly known as a trends player who sees the direction that the market is heading and then places bets to benefit from them."", ""While this approach led to a muted performance by Mr. Tudor and his firm over the past decade, these days it's become more important. This is because interest rates are at record high levels once again, and shifts in commodities industries such as the oil market have become more common due to conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine war in the Middle East. The shifting trends also suggest that Tudor Investment is benefiting from the changes, since its Q3 2023 portfolio of $9.9 billion marks a sizeable growth over its value of $4.6 billion during the year ago quarter."", ""Tudor Investment's investment portfolio has more than doubled over the year, and this makes looking at its latest investments even more important.

His departure came the day after he apologized to the unit’s employees for problems that led to action from state and federal regulators in the wake of a series of accidents.', 'It’s a relatively rapid turn of events at the company, which just three months ago had won approval to operate its driverless taxis 24/7 in San Francisco and announced plans to expand to additional US cities. And a month ago it announced it would team with Honda to bring robotaxis to Japan.', 'But collisions and injuries involving pedestrians forced the company to essentially halt its robotaxi service nationwide at the end of October after California authorities revoked its right to operate driverless cars in the state.', 'Despite the myriad of problems and the turnover at the top, GM said Sunday it was sticking with Cruise and its efforts to develop self-driving cars. Besides the safety issues at Cruise, the unit has cost the company $5.9 billion before interest and taxes since the start of 2020. A bit more than a year ago, Ford and Volkswagen pulled the plug on their own joint efforts to develop self-driving cars, as executives at those rival automakers questioned whether robotaxis would be financially viable anytime soon.', 'The most serious accident involving Cruise was one on October 2 involving a pedestrian in San Francisco who was critically injured when hit, first by a traditional human-driven car, then by a Cruise driverless car.

We need to double down on safety, transparency, and community engagement.”', 'Vogt founded the company in San Francisco in 2013, and sold an 80% majority stake to GM in 2016 for $581 million, with half of that in cash and the rest in GM stock.', 'Much of the remaining 20% stake in Cruise had been held by employees of the unit, who had the opportunity to sell their shares back to GM. Reuters reported last week that it had temporarily halted those share sales by employees due to its financial and safety problems, only to restart the sales in the face of employee complaints.', 'The company confirmed Sunday night it had accepted Vogt resignation. GM had already moved to take greater control over the unit, last week naming GM General Counsel Craig Glidden as co-president and chief administrative officer of Cruise. Mo Elshenawy, who had been with Cruise for six years, was named the other co-president, in addition to his role as chief technology officer. No new CEO was named Sunday as part of Vogt’s departure statement.', '“GM has made a bold commitment to autonomous vehicle technology because we believe in the profound, positive impact it will have on societies, including saving countless lives,” GM said in a statement Sunday night.', '“We believe strongly in Cruise’s mission and the transformative technology it is developing. We fully support the actions that Cruise leadership is taking to ensure that it is putting safety first and building trust and credibility with government partners, regulators, and the broader community,” said the statement. “Our commitment to Cruise with the goal of commercialization remains steadfast.”', '– CNN’s Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Watch the video above to hear what one of the bright spots for retail has been.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- All eyes are on the retail giants, this week with Black Friday just around the corner. But several companies warned on a weaker consumer this holiday season. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the details. Brooke, I know I'm all shopped out already and it hasn't even started yet. I just can't be bothered this year."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Rachelle, guilty as charged as well. I've been shopping for deals all weekend. But despite looking for deals, it's no secret that consumers' wallets remain pinched, and they're becoming, just like me, more and more mindful of just how much they're willing to shell out this holiday season. In a recent earnings, report both from Walmart, as well as Target, we got an inside look into the state of the US consumer. And Walmart CFO John David Rainey also joined Yahoo Finance to share what's happening right now ahead of their biggest time of year."", ""JOHN DAVID RAINEY: We've seen consistent growth, pretty consistent each month of the quarter in most categories of our business. As we got into the back half of October, we saw that slip a little bit. And sometimes that can be related to unseasonal weather. It could be related to other things that are happening in the economy. And so we called that out because it was a little bit different than what we've seen for the first part of the year."", ""That said, as we look into November and particularly around some of the events that we've had for our holiday shopping, we've seen pretty good strength. And so what that tells me is that the consumer is being discerning, maybe choiceful."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: And in years past, despite warmer temperatures in the fall, consumers would still stock up on winter apparel ahead of the colder season. But now we're not seeing that as much. And Target shared a similar story. CEO Brian Cornell shared some headwinds up against the consumer on its third quarter earnings call. Take a listen to this."", 'BRIAN CORNELL: Overall, consumers are still spending, but pressures like higher interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayments, increased credit card debt, and reduced savings rates have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade offs in their family budgets.', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: And what we're really seeing here is both retailers leaning very heavily into value offerings and inventory management. They want to make sure that what consumers want, and what they're budgeting for is, ultimately, in store and also at the right price. And so, Rachelle, as we both said at the top, we've been looking at deals all weekend. We've been looking for the best bang for our buck, and I'm sure we're not alone."", ""- Indeed. I know I was out there looking as well. Didn't find anything I loved that was worth splashing out on. But Brooke, there's also been that one space that consumers aren't shying away from spending big on. What's that?"", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, Rachelle. That's beauty. We're not shying away from spending more to make ourselves look good. In terms of Macy's, and Target. Those are two retailers that we heard from last week where we saw growth in beauty sales. Now, what's amazing there is that Macy's and Target both reported sales declines, but they did say that they saw strength in beauty. Now for, Macy's, they also have that cosmetics business, Bluemercury, they noted continued strength there."", ""And Macy's also pointing out the strength in fragrances and prestige cosmetics. And target, they have that Ulta Beauty business they acquired or rather launched back in 2021 in stores, and that's been showing strength for them as well. Now, what this ultimately all means is when I spoke to a consumer psychologist, there's two things. Consumers' wallets are pinched right now, but she's calling it the two for one effect."", ""So they're saying, hey, if I buy beauty items, it's going to make me look good, which, ultimately, makes me feel better. And in turn, it makes consumers feel like they're spending less on those bigger ticket items that we know consumers are shying away from. And so in this sort of economy, we are seeing beauty sales remain strong, and it'll be interesting to see if that continues. But we know that's always been a bright spot when consumers see a downturn."", ""- It's true. A little cheap pick me up. A little something that you can splash out on. Brooke DiPalma, thank you so much.""]"

""As outlined last quarter, we expect customer inventory digestion to persist into the first half of the year, a reflection of our return to normal lead times and the challenging macro landscape. Despite that backdrop, the robustness of our business model and our continued focus on execution excellence will buttress our operating margins and free cash flow through the cycle.""', 'Roche continued, ""Long-term, the opportunities ahead for ADI remain strongly positive. Our product portfolio is designed to take advantage of numerous secular trends, our opportunity pipeline is robust and expanding, and our commitment to strategic investment in innovation, customer engagement, and supply resiliency remains undeterred. Altogether, I am extremely confident in our ability to leverage these strengths to drive shareholder value for years to come.""', 'Performance for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023', 'Results Summary(1)', '(in millions, except per-share amounts and percentages)', 'Three Months Ended', 'Twelve Months Ended', 'Oct. 28, 2023', 'Oct. 29, 2022', 'Change', 'Oct. 28, 2023', 'Oct. 29, 2022', 'Change', 'Revenue', '$', '2,716', '$', '3,248', '(16) %', '$', '12,306', '$', '12,014', '2 %', 'Gross margin', '$', '1,647', '$', '2,143', '(23) %', '$', '7,877', '$', '7,532', '5 %', 'Gross margin percentage', '60.6 %', '66.0 %', '(540 bps)', '64.0 %', '62.7 %', '130 bps', 'Operating income', '$', '634', '$', '1,102', '(42) %', '$', '3,823', '$', '3,279', '17 %', 'Operating margin', '23.4 %', '33.9 %', '(1,050 bps)', '31.1 %', '27.3 %', '380 bps', 'Diluted earnings per share', '$', '1.00', '$', '1.82', '(45) %', '$', '6.55', '$', '5.25', '25 %', 'Adjusted Results(2)', 'Adjusted gross margin', '$', '1,907', '$', '2,403', '(21) %', '$', '8,925', '$', '8,842', '1 %', 'Adjusted gross margin percentage', '70.2 %', '74.0 %', '(380 bps)', '72.5 %', '73.6 %', '(110 bps)', 'Adjusted operating income', '$', '1,215', '$', '1,659', '(27) %', '$', '6,014', '$', '5,939', '1 %', 'Adjusted operating margin', '44.7 %', '51.1 %', '(640 bps)', '48.9 %', '49.4 %', '(50 bps)', 'Adjusted diluted earnings per share', '$', '2.01', '$', '2.73', '(26) %', '$', '10.09', '$', '9.57', '5 %', 'Three Months Ended', 'Trailing Twelve Months', 'Cash Generation', 'Oct. 28, 2023', 'Oct. 28, 2023', 'Net cash provided by operating activities', '$', '1,187', '$', '4,818', '% of revenue', '44 %', '39 %', 'Capital expenditures', '$', '(476)', '$', '(1,261)', 'Free cash flow(2)', '$', '711', '$', '3,556', '% of revenue', '26 %', '29 %', 'Three Months Ended', 'Trailing Twelve Months', 'Cash Return', 'Oct. 28, 2023', 'Oct. 28, 2023', 'Dividend paid', '$', '(428)', '$', '(1,679)', 'Stock repurchases', '(470)', '(2,964)', 'Total cash returned', '$', '(898)', '$', '(4,643)', '(1) The sum and/or computation of the individual amounts may not equal the total due to rounding.', '(2) Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included in this press release.

In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures.

These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that free cash flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure, is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.', 'The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.', 'Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain acquisition related expenses1, which are described further below.

If you want to skip our overview of Stanley Druckenmiller's 2023 stock portfolio, then take a look at the\xa05 Stocks Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Just Bought and Sold. "", ""The third quarter of the 2023 hedge fund filing season is one of the more important ones that we've come across. This is because the third quarter was the first time in months that it appeared that the stock market might be entering a new era. Before developments in November, investors were uncertain about the trajectory that the Federal Reserve might take with its future interest rate decisions. While inflation has dropped in America for most of the year, a robust job market and the recent conflict in the Middle East have nevertheless created uncertainty that the Fed might be back with its interest rate gavel faster than investors can say 'recession.'"", 'However, now not only is inflation undershooting consensus estimates but prices higher up in the supply chain are also falling. At the same time, crude oil is also becoming cheaper, and while all these signals also herald the start of a recession, they make it abundantly clear that if future data releases follow this trend, then the Fed will have few reasons to continue raising interest rates', ""This environment makes the current hedge fund filing season even more important. This is because it's when the funds might be starting to reposition their investment portfolios to account for the changing financial conditions. One hedge fund boss who has seen his fair share of fame in the financial industry is Stanely Druckenmiller. Mr. Druckenmiller ran his own fund for years before retiring and pooling his personal money into the Duquesne Family Office. Running a family office saves him from the stress that comes with managing outsider money, and judging by the family office's latest SEC filings, it appears that Mr. Druckenmiller is doing quite well for himself."", ""His firm's Q3 2023 SEC filings reveal that the investment portfolio was worth $2.7 billion. This marked a small $100 million drop over the second quarter and a sizeable $1 billion increase over the third quarter of 2022. Mr. Druckenmiller had quite a busy third quarter as he added dozens of new companies to his portfolio and completely existed even dozens more. For instance, during the third quarter of 2023, the Duquesne Family Office bought shares of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG), Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), and Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR). These firms belong to a wide variety of sectors, indicating an agnostic approach that appears to be driven by fundamentals as opposed to broader economic trends."", ""As to what's on Mr. Druckenmiller's mind these days, here's what he had to say during a recent fireside chat along with billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. According to the billionaire:"", ""I did an interview, about a year ago, and said for the first time I was more worried about growth in this country than inflation. That has a dangling participle to it because that was sort of an intermediate forecast, wrong on growth, right on finflation by the way, very wrong on growth. But going forward, I would say this. I grew up in the 70s, that's when I started in the business. And you had a few periods where inflation came down from like seven to three or seven to four, and thy thought they had it bet and Arthur Burns put his foot on the gas and as everybody knows now it ended up you 12 or 13 before Volcker came in and smashed it. That's a big debate now for money managers. I don't have to answer that question yet, but since you asked it, I guess I do because we're in front of a bunch of smart people. I would say this: Under a Trump administration, what I would be terrified of because he's a big spender, he doesn't believe in the Federal Reserve, we go back to the Arthur Burns model times two. So, you have fiscal recklessness, un abandon, just like he's run his business. And on top of that, he puts a puppet into the Federal Reserve. Under that model, you have to be open minded to eight to ten percent inflation, a takeoff like you did in the 70s after probably an intermediate lull here after a year or two. You didn't give me a third option, which I would say is a non-Trump Republican. There are candidates out there where I could see the opposite. You get the debt blowup and something really horrible happens, and you potentially get deflation. But, under that case I guess my central case would be somewhere in the three or four area. Again, don't trade on any on this, we're just talking about the future and we'll change our mind five times between now and then."", ""So, with Mr. Druckenmiller being as prescient as ever, it's absolutely essential to know which stocks he's buying and which stocks he's selling.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' View our latest analysis for KLA ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that KLA had debt of US$5.89b at the end of September 2023, a reduction from US$6.31b over a year. On the flip side, it has US$3.35b in cash leading to net debt of about US$2.54b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that KLA had liabilities of US$3.82b due within a year, and liabilities of US$7.33b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.35b as well as receivables valued at US$1.72b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$6.07b.', ""Given KLA has a humongous market capitalization of US$74.2b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""KLA's net debt is only 0.61 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 17.0 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On the other hand, KLA saw its EBIT drop by 4.1% in the last twelve months. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if KLA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, KLA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 82% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""KLA's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Zooming out, KLA seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  KLA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about..."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the latest stock market news, then take a look at 5 Stocks Billionaire Larry Robbins Just Bought and Sold. ', ""Larry Robbins is one of the more interesting hedge fund bosses in the finance industry. He set up his hedge fund Glenview Capital in 2000, and according to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund had an investment portfolio worth $4.4 billion during the third quarter of this year. This value sees the portfolio stay flat over 2023's June quarter and a $400 million growth over last year's third quarter."", ""Unlike some other hedge funds which loathe uncertainty and seek to divest their holdings at the slightest hint of volatility, Mr. Robbins is known for holding stocks for a long time period. This also means that his fund swings between losses and gains based on the broader trading environment. For instance, in 2008, which was the worst period for the finance industry in 2008, Mr. Robbins' fund lost nearly $4.5 billion in assets. However, over a longer time period, say between 2001 to 2010, the hedge fund posted a whopping 301% net fee return, and after the 2008 hit, it went on to soar 82.7% in 2009."", ""Like others, Mr. Robbins is also a prudent market analyst. Some of his strongest bets came during 2021 when the coronavirus pandemic was raging its devastation. Back then, the billionaire hedge fund owner repeated his strong healthcare investments streak and went on to buy healthcare and travel stocks in 2020. This led to his hedge fund returning 10.3% in 2021 as the healthcare bets paid off with Wall Street piling into them in hopes of a cure for the virus. Healthcare continues to be a favorite Larry Robbins play as of the third quarter of 2023, since his firm's three biggest investments are in healthcare companies. These are Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), and Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS). Cumulatively, they represent roughly a quarter of Glenview Capital's Q3 2023 investment portfolio, as the hedge fund has piled in roughly $1.1 billion in the three companies only."", ""Additionally, Larry Robbins's investing philosophy places him right alongside some of the biggest names in the industry such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. This is because he believes that instead of acting as traders that jump to sell shares as soon as the share price nosedives, Mr. Robbins believes that investors should act more like owners. This involves working closely with company management teams to build relationships and understand the intricate nature of a business to see whether its fundamentals can support hefty share price appreciation in the future."", ""Mr. Robbins' hedge fund, Glenview Capital's investment strategy is also often described as a mix of growth and value investment. The strategy is often dubbed as GARP, an acronym for Growth At a Reasonable Price after an interview he gave to Value Investor Insight Magazine in 2005. This approach has seen the fund target not only healthcare companies but also technology and other firms that it believes have the potential to post share price appreciation in the future while still being modestly priced."", ""Shifting our focus from Larry Robbins to the broader economic environment, right now, it appears that the winds of investing are shifting. This is because inflation has fallen by quite a bit, and the data for October saw major stock indexes soar as investors made bets that the Federal Reserve is done with its interest rate hikes. However, at the same time, some strange events are taking place in the stock market. For those out of the loop, volatility in investing refers to rapid share movement and the index that tracks this volatility is the Cboe Volatility Index also called the VIX. So what's strange about that? Well, data compiled by Reuters shows that nearly a hundred thousand call options with a strike price of 27 closing in January 2024 have been opened. They join other options that were recently opened, and cumulatively, a whopping half a million January call options are in play. Does this mean that some big fish is betting that stocks will go through a sell off and cause the VIX to spike? Not necessarily, as the positions could indicate hedging for other positions."", 'So, as the market breathes and somebody bets that volatility will jump, what stocks is Larry Robbins buying and selling?

You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime.', ""Experienced investors often stress that patience is crucial in investing, and they're definitely right about that. Being patient means looking at investments for the long haul and not rushing into decisions. The most successful investors take their time, study markets and trends, and only decide after watching things for a while. Being patient pays off big time, leading to more success and stability in the long run. A Middlefield Investments report analyzed the S&P 500's total return from December 31, 1992, to December 31, 2022, splitting it into two parts. Out of the total return of +1,481%, 47% came from dividends and reinvested dividends, while 53% was from the increase in stock prices. This shows that patient investors gain a lot from the compounding effect by investing in companies that consistently pay and increase their dividends over time."", ""The same report from the Canada-based equity income manager also mentioned that dividends act as a strong defense against inflation. High-quality companies often adjust their prices to safeguard their earnings from inflation. This helps them maintain their dividend payments consistently even through different market cycles. That's why dividends played a bigger role in total returns (more than 50%) during inflation-heavy decades like the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s. It highlights why dividends continue to be a key source for competitive long-term returns for shareholders. On the flip side, other options for yield, like fixed income, can suffer significant losses during high inflation periods."", ""The blend of yields and dividend growth is a powerful combination that benefits investors in multiple ways. High yields offer an immediate income stream, providing a steady cash flow, which can be particularly valuable in volatile markets or during economic downturns. Meanwhile, companies with a history of consistent dividend growth often signal financial strength and stability. As these companies increase their dividends over time, investors not only enjoy a rising income but also benefit from the compounding effect, amplifying their returns. That said, analysts stress the importance of maintaining a healthy dividend yield to benefit investors because excessively high yields often indicate underlying financial issues within a company. Historical analysis showed that these stocks have performed better than the overall market in the past. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series, which tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks in each market with a record of consistently paying dividends, achieved an average annual return of 11.7% between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, considering reinvested dividends. This outperformed its benchmark's 10.2% return during the same period, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices."", ""In addition to generating strong returns, dividend-growing companies often possess the capacity to expand their revenues consistently. These companies typically exhibit strong fundamentals and effective business models. The commitment to sustaining and increasing dividends often aligns with a company's ability to generate steady cash flows and profitability. This financial stability allows them to reinvest profits back into the business, fostering growth initiatives that drive revenue expansion. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are some of the best stocks as these companies have shown strong revenue growth over the years and have also raised their dividends for decades.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 2nd of January, with investors receiving $0.61 per share. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 3.0%.', ' See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', 'We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. The last payment made up 74% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 64.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 47% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.44. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.7% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. C.H. Robinson Worldwide has seen earnings per share falling at 5.8% per year over the last five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern."", ""Overall, we think C.H. Robinson Worldwide is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for C.H.

It's a mirror image of upsizing the restructuring, the $7.5 billion restructuring. And so I think that's very much on track. I think there is an outstanding question where the street's really giving no credit, and this really underpins the bull case. Which is, once the streaming business gets to break even, can they actually generate Netflix type margins in the streaming business."", ""That's still a long way off. And I think you have to give lower marks for that just because there's a lot of wood to chop between where we are now and where we're going.

If you want to skip our introduction to the multi billionaire dollar hedge fund and what its founder believes is in store for the markets and the economy, then take a look at Citadel Stock Holdings: 5 Biggest Energy Stocks. "", ""With the third quarter hedge fund filing season with us in full flow, it's time to take a look at what the master investors are doing. This year has been a topsy turvy ride for stock markets, and it can very well be argued that had investors not piled into technology stocks in H1 2023 due to the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence, then until November, stocks would have been flat or down."", 'However, November is proving to be a boon for markets. This is because the inflation data for October not only showed a marked sequential drop from September but also ended up undershooting consensus estimates. This caused stocks to rally, with major U.S. stock indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 rising by more than a percent within an hour of opening. With the latest inflation data, the focus on Wall Street has now shifted to when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates as opposed to whether it will deliver another rate hike.', 'One of the biggest threats to the dissipating economic clouds right now is the global energy industry. The energy sector was dead center of the 2022 stock market sell off, the effects of which are still lingering as the S&P 500 is still down from its December 2021 closing. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global energy supply chains and it saw global oil prices shoot up. This ended up pushing inflation to record high levels and spurred central banks to deal hefty economic blows by jacking up the policy rate.', ""With less than half a quarter left until 2023's close, there is a risk that a resurgence in global oil prices could make inflation rear its head once again. If it does, then markets might very well start to fall again as investors price in higher interest rates. Right now, particularly after the bombshell October inflation report, this might be particularly painful for investors since November is perhaps the first time in more than a year that they can wholeheartedly look forward to stock market growth."", ""Yet, as the conventional energy segment is as turbulent as ever, there is a lot of optimism in the clean and alternative energy area. This is because according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Employment report, more than half of the total energy industry employment growth in last year was in sectors such as solar panels, electric cars, metal mining, and heat pumps. All these sectors are part of the renewable energy industry, and they seek to decrease the world's reliance on polluting petroleum fuels. The IEA outlines that solar energy led within the alternative energy sector as it employed four million people."", ""Even though the stock market might fall and cause losses all around, this doesn't mean that everyone loses money. One of the best examples of this fact is billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel Investment Group. Citadel is the ninth biggest hedge fund in the world in terms of net assets, as it controlled $62 billion as of June 2023. The firm's investment portfolio, which is measured through its direct stock holdings and the non market value of options, sat at $466 billion as of Q3 2023 end. So why is Mr. Griffin's fund the right one to study if one wants to know how to make money when others are losing it? Well, the answer is simple. Citadel was the world's best performing hedge fund in 2022, a torrid time for the industry overall that saw hundreds of billions of dollars in losses."", 'So, what does the investment guru believe is in store for us in the future? Well, Mr. Griffin believes that one of the most important indicators that we need to be watching right now is the labor market as according to him:', ""And I think there's a couple of really important questions that will come into bear at that moment in time that should influence one's view as to how deep this recession is going to be. Number 1 is what's going to happen to the fiscal policy of the United States. For choice, we think next year fiscal policy will not tighten that much. We're heading into a presidential election. It's really hard for politicians on either side of the aisle. What we need to do, which is to reign in our deficit spending in front of a presidential election. It's just going to be really hard politically to get there next year on that front."", ""The second real question next year is how much will companies start to unwind the labor hoarding that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been really hard to hire people. And as such large companies have been really reticent to let people go no matter what the circumstances are. So even if margins are contracting, even if you have gains from automation, people have been very reticent to let people go. Now we're starting to see for the first time that unwinding of that labor hoarding. What we don't know is how much of that labor hoarding as taken place. And what worries me, in a hybrid work environment, or work from home environment, the cultural or social contract that holds people together in a company is unquestionably weaker. I mean we've all read about companies that have fired thousands of people on Zoom calls. There's no sense of 'that's Jane, whose worked down the hall with me for years and I'm going to go the extra distance to try to keep Jane employed here'. It's like 'here's the email to all, here's the video conference for the bunch of people, and goodbye'."", ""It's a very different moment in American employment history, where I believe the bond between the company and the employee has become far weaker. And that worries me in terms of the willingness of corporate America to make cuts on their workforce they just won't have made at other similar points in the labor market cycle."", ""With the business world being as dynamic as ever and some interesting times ahead of us, we decided to look at Ken Griffin's top energy stock picks and the leading names are PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)."", 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Investment Group', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Ken Griffin's top energy stocks, we took a look at Citadel Investment's Q3 2023 investment portfolio and selected the energy and utility companies in which the firm has invested the most money."", ""Citadel Investment's Q3 2023 Investment: $138 million"", 'Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) is a small oil and gas exploration company headquartered in Houston, Texas.

If you want to skip our introduction to Mr. Watsa, his hedge fund, and the latest stock market news, then take a look at 5 Stocks Prem Watsa Just Bought and Sold. ', ""Prem Watsa is one of the lower profile fund bosses in the industry. A graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology and the University of Western Ontario, he was born in India and is a classic example of the potential of capitalism to turn one from rags to riches through dedication and the right business decisions. After graduating with an MBA in Canada, Mr. Watsa jumped into the financial world and started his stint at an insurance company. Soon after beginning his finance career, he started his own finance company and acquired an insurance company to rename the new firm Fairfax Financial. The term 'Fairfax' refers to 'fair, friendly acquisitions' and according to Insider Monkey's research, the firm had an investment portfolio worth $1.8 billion as of Q3 2023 end. This marks a sizeable drop over the $3.9 billion that the portfolio was worth as of September 2022."", ""Prem Watsa's firm, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited was officially set up in its current form in 1985. The firm's shares are also traded on the Canadian stock exchange under the ticker Fairfax Financial Holdings (TSE:FFH.TO). Being publicly traded is an integral part of Fairfax's financial philosophy and strategy since the firm seeks to deliver a minimum of 15% growth in its book value per share over the long term. Book value per share is defined as a firm's net asset value, i.e. its liabilities subtracted from its assets, per unit of outstanding stock. It is a commonly used financial metric that allows investors and analysts to analyze the worth of a firm or the money that is available to investors in case of a liquidation. Fairfax describes itself as being focused on the long term, and the firm touts that it has written a whopping $229 billion in insurance premiums over the past 37 years."", ""Since it's a publicly traded firm, SEC filings provide greater working into Fairfax Financial's affairs than would be possible for other hedge funds. The firm filed its earnings report for the third quarter with the SEC in November. The results showed that its insurance revenue during the quarter stood at a cool $7 billion and its non-insurance operations raked in $1 billion for a combined revenue of $7 billion. The insurance industry benefits when interest rates are high, and this was evident in Fairfax's latest earnings results as well since the company's profit after tax stood at $1.1 billion and nearly doubled from the year ago quarter's $582 million."", 'In terms of assets, Fairfax is quite a sizeable entity as well with total assets of $84 billion. Within this multi-billion-dollar asset pile, a large portion belongs to bonds as the company held a cool $34 billion in bonds. Stocks were its second largest holdings, and in Q3, Fairfax Financial held $8.9 billion in preferred and common stocks.', ""Shifting gears to analyze Prem Watsa's latest stock portfolio, its five biggest investments in Q3 ranged from energy to semiconductors, consumer electronics, mining, and real estate industries. In descending order, Fairfax Financial's biggest stock holdings in the third quarter were Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB), Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KW), and Orla Mining Ltd. (NYSE:ORLA). Cumulatively, these account for more than 60% of the $1.8 billion stock portfolio as Mr. Watsa's financial firm owned stakes worth $1.1 billion in the five companies."", 'Shifting gears to focus on the broader stock market climate during the third quarter, right now, optimism is abound. This is because investors are now making cautious bets that the Federal Reserve might be near the end of its interest rate cycle with some already making bets about when rates will start to come down. However, the road to low rates might be long, with fresh comments from some Fed officials culling optimistic stock rallies. For instance, the Chair of the Boston Fed Susan Collins is unwilling to rule out further rate hikes before additional data convinces her that the central bank has done enough. Speaking to CNBC, the Fed official shared:', ""In order to get back down to 2% (inflation) in a reasonable amount of time you need to be patient and resolute, and I wouldn't take additional firming off the table."", 'She went on to add:', ""I remain focused on really looking at kind of the full complement of information that we're getting and making assessments in real time about the right thing to do."", ""So, as investors flirt with the new interest rate era, what is one of Canada's richest financial wizards thinking? We took a look at his firm's stock portfolio to find out, and some stocks that caught our eye are Orla Mining Ltd. (NYSE:ORLA), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)."", 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of the stocks that Prem Watsa bought and sold, we divided Fairfax Financial's investment portfolio into two sections. The first section consisted of stocks that the firm initiated new positions in or piled more money into. The second was made of stocks that it sold or exited completely.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$8.73b', 'US$9.68b', 'US$9.79b', 'US$10.4b', 'US$10.9b', 'US$11.3b', 'US$11.7b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$12.4b', 'US$12.7b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 4.48%', 'Est @ 3.80%', 'Est @ 3.33%', 'Est @ 3.00%', 'Est @ 2.76%', 'Est @ 2.60%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% ', 'US$8.1k', 'US$8.3k', 'US$7.7k', 'US$7.6k', 'US$7.3k', 'US$7.0k', 'US$6.7k', 'US$6.4k', 'US$6.1k', 'US$5.8k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$71b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.205. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP), which has not only revenues, but also profits.

That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, American Express has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 39%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of American Express' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. American Express maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 9.6% to US$54b.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$162m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""American Express' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering American Express for a spot on your watchlist. Of course, just because American Express is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.It has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to the top and bottom lines beating the consensus mark for the fifth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consequently, PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.However, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher SG&A costs, higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks, which acts as a headwind.(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)Shares of Novartis have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.7% vs. +12.0%). The company’s third-quarter results were better than expected as drugs like Entresto, Kesimpta, Zolgensma, Kisqali and Leqvio continued to fuel growth and offset the impact of generic competition. Pluvicto and Scemblix have witnessed solid launches and Leqvio’s launch continues to progress.With the separation of Sandoz, Novartis has become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. The acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics has strengthened its renal pipeline. However, generic competition for key drugs like Gilenya and pipeline setbacks remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Novartis here >>>)Shares of Mondelez International have outperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (+9.7% vs. -11.3%). The company, which has been seeing solid organic revenues, has been benefiting from strength in emerging markets and its core chocolate and biscuit categories.It has also been focused on strengthening areas with higher growth potential via prudent buyouts (like Clif Bar) and divestitures. These upsides, together with pricing actions, fueled third-quarter 2023 results, wherein management raised its 2023 organic net revenue and earnings guidance.However, Mondelez has been battling challenges related to global cost inflation.

If you want to skip our introduction to the multi billionaire dollar hedge fund and what its founder believes is in store for the markets and the economy, then take a look at Citadel Stock Holdings: 5 Biggest Energy Stocks. "", ""With the third quarter hedge fund filing season with us in full flow, it's time to take a look at what the master investors are doing. This year has been a topsy turvy ride for stock markets, and it can very well be argued that had investors not piled into technology stocks in H1 2023 due to the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence, then until November, stocks would have been flat or down."", 'However, November is proving to be a boon for markets. This is because the inflation data for October not only showed a marked sequential drop from September but also ended up undershooting consensus estimates. This caused stocks to rally, with major U.S. stock indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 rising by more than a percent within an hour of opening. With the latest inflation data, the focus on Wall Street has now shifted to when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates as opposed to whether it will deliver another rate hike.', 'One of the biggest threats to the dissipating economic clouds right now is the global energy industry. The energy sector was dead center of the 2022 stock market sell off, the effects of which are still lingering as the S&P 500 is still down from its December 2021 closing. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global energy supply chains and it saw global oil prices shoot up. This ended up pushing inflation to record high levels and spurred central banks to deal hefty economic blows by jacking up the policy rate.', ""With less than half a quarter left until 2023's close, there is a risk that a resurgence in global oil prices could make inflation rear its head once again. If it does, then markets might very well start to fall again as investors price in higher interest rates. Right now, particularly after the bombshell October inflation report, this might be particularly painful for investors since November is perhaps the first time in more than a year that they can wholeheartedly look forward to stock market growth."", ""Yet, as the conventional energy segment is as turbulent as ever, there is a lot of optimism in the clean and alternative energy area. This is because according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Employment report, more than half of the total energy industry employment growth in last year was in sectors such as solar panels, electric cars, metal mining, and heat pumps. All these sectors are part of the renewable energy industry, and they seek to decrease the world's reliance on polluting petroleum fuels. The IEA outlines that solar energy led within the alternative energy sector as it employed four million people."", ""Even though the stock market might fall and cause losses all around, this doesn't mean that everyone loses money. One of the best examples of this fact is billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel Investment Group. Citadel is the ninth biggest hedge fund in the world in terms of net assets, as it controlled $62 billion as of June 2023. The firm's investment portfolio, which is measured through its direct stock holdings and the non market value of options, sat at $466 billion as of Q3 2023 end. So why is Mr. Griffin's fund the right one to study if one wants to know how to make money when others are losing it? Well, the answer is simple. Citadel was the world's best performing hedge fund in 2022, a torrid time for the industry overall that saw hundreds of billions of dollars in losses."", 'So, what does the investment guru believe is in store for us in the future? Well, Mr. Griffin believes that one of the most important indicators that we need to be watching right now is the labor market as according to him:', ""And I think there's a couple of really important questions that will come into bear at that moment in time that should influence one's view as to how deep this recession is going to be. Number 1 is what's going to happen to the fiscal policy of the United States. For choice, we think next year fiscal policy will not tighten that much. We're heading into a presidential election. It's really hard for politicians on either side of the aisle. What we need to do, which is to reign in our deficit spending in front of a presidential election. It's just going to be really hard politically to get there next year on that front."", ""The second real question next year is how much will companies start to unwind the labor hoarding that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been really hard to hire people. And as such large companies have been really reticent to let people go no matter what the circumstances are. So even if margins are contracting, even if you have gains from automation, people have been very reticent to let people go. Now we're starting to see for the first time that unwinding of that labor hoarding. What we don't know is how much of that labor hoarding as taken place. And what worries me, in a hybrid work environment, or work from home environment, the cultural or social contract that holds people together in a company is unquestionably weaker. I mean we've all read about companies that have fired thousands of people on Zoom calls. There's no sense of 'that's Jane, whose worked down the hall with me for years and I'm going to go the extra distance to try to keep Jane employed here'. It's like 'here's the email to all, here's the video conference for the bunch of people, and goodbye'."", ""It's a very different moment in American employment history, where I believe the bond between the company and the employee has become far weaker. And that worries me in terms of the willingness of corporate America to make cuts on their workforce they just won't have made at other similar points in the labor market cycle."", ""With the business world being as dynamic as ever and some interesting times ahead of us, we decided to look at Ken Griffin's top energy stock picks and the leading names are PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), BP p.l.c.

Environmental stocks are shares of firms that are focused on sustainability, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other green initiatives.

Outside Europe and North America, Asian regions are also seeing an increase in EV production. For instance, India, Thailand, and Indonesia collectively witnessed 80,000 sales of EVs in 2022 which was more than three times compared to 2021. Looking ahead, China maintains its ranking as the biggest market for electric cars with 40% of consolidated sales by 2030, the IEA said.', 'Renewable energy also plays a fundamental role in the global environment.

If you want to skip our introduction to the multi billionaire dollar hedge fund and what its founder believes is in store for the markets and the economy, then take a look at Citadel Stock Holdings: 5 Biggest Energy Stocks. "", ""With the third quarter hedge fund filing season with us in full flow, it's time to take a look at what the master investors are doing. This year has been a topsy turvy ride for stock markets, and it can very well be argued that had investors not piled into technology stocks in H1 2023 due to the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence, then until November, stocks would have been flat or down."", 'However, November is proving to be a boon for markets. This is because the inflation data for October not only showed a marked sequential drop from September but also ended up undershooting consensus estimates. This caused stocks to rally, with major U.S. stock indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 rising by more than a percent within an hour of opening. With the latest inflation data, the focus on Wall Street has now shifted to when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates as opposed to whether it will deliver another rate hike.', 'One of the biggest threats to the dissipating economic clouds right now is the global energy industry. The energy sector was dead center of the 2022 stock market sell off, the effects of which are still lingering as the S&P 500 is still down from its December 2021 closing. The Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global energy supply chains and it saw global oil prices shoot up. This ended up pushing inflation to record high levels and spurred central banks to deal hefty economic blows by jacking up the policy rate.', ""With less than half a quarter left until 2023's close, there is a risk that a resurgence in global oil prices could make inflation rear its head once again. If it does, then markets might very well start to fall again as investors price in higher interest rates. Right now, particularly after the bombshell October inflation report, this might be particularly painful for investors since November is perhaps the first time in more than a year that they can wholeheartedly look forward to stock market growth."", ""Yet, as the conventional energy segment is as turbulent as ever, there is a lot of optimism in the clean and alternative energy area. This is because according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Employment report, more than half of the total energy industry employment growth in last year was in sectors such as solar panels, electric cars, metal mining, and heat pumps. All these sectors are part of the renewable energy industry, and they seek to decrease the world's reliance on polluting petroleum fuels. The IEA outlines that solar energy led within the alternative energy sector as it employed four million people."", ""Even though the stock market might fall and cause losses all around, this doesn't mean that everyone loses money. One of the best examples of this fact is billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel Investment Group. Citadel is the ninth biggest hedge fund in the world in terms of net assets, as it controlled $62 billion as of June 2023. The firm's investment portfolio, which is measured through its direct stock holdings and the non market value of options, sat at $466 billion as of Q3 2023 end. So why is Mr. Griffin's fund the right one to study if one wants to know how to make money when others are losing it? Well, the answer is simple. Citadel was the world's best performing hedge fund in 2022, a torrid time for the industry overall that saw hundreds of billions of dollars in losses."", 'So, what does the investment guru believe is in store for us in the future? Well, Mr. Griffin believes that one of the most important indicators that we need to be watching right now is the labor market as according to him:', ""And I think there's a couple of really important questions that will come into bear at that moment in time that should influence one's view as to how deep this recession is going to be. Number 1 is what's going to happen to the fiscal policy of the United States. For choice, we think next year fiscal policy will not tighten that much. We're heading into a presidential election. It's really hard for politicians on either side of the aisle. What we need to do, which is to reign in our deficit spending in front of a presidential election. It's just going to be really hard politically to get there next year on that front."", ""The second real question next year is how much will companies start to unwind the labor hoarding that we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been really hard to hire people. And as such large companies have been really reticent to let people go no matter what the circumstances are. So even if margins are contracting, even if you have gains from automation, people have been very reticent to let people go. Now we're starting to see for the first time that unwinding of that labor hoarding. What we don't know is how much of that labor hoarding as taken place. And what worries me, in a hybrid work environment, or work from home environment, the cultural or social contract that holds people together in a company is unquestionably weaker. I mean we've all read about companies that have fired thousands of people on Zoom calls. There's no sense of 'that's Jane, whose worked down the hall with me for years and I'm going to go the extra distance to try to keep Jane employed here'. It's like 'here's the email to all, here's the video conference for the bunch of people, and goodbye'."", ""It's a very different moment in American employment history, where I believe the bond between the company and the employee has become far weaker. And that worries me in terms of the willingness of corporate America to make cuts on their workforce they just won't have made at other similar points in the labor market cycle."", ""With the business world being as dynamic as ever and some interesting times ahead of us, we decided to look at Ken Griffin's top energy stock picks and the leading names are PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)."", 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Investment Group', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Ken Griffin's top energy stocks, we took a look at Citadel Investment's Q3 2023 investment portfolio and selected the energy and utility companies in which the firm has invested the most money."", ""Citadel Investment's Q3 2023 Investment: $138 million"", 'Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD) is a small oil and gas exploration company headquartered in Houston, Texas.

The utilities under the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry control miles of underground pipeline network to provide natural gas services to customers. The rising demand for clean, burning natural gas will create more opportunities for natural gas distribution companies.', 'Sempra Energy, with its widespread transmission and distribution lines and interstate pipelines, and significant investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2023-2024 time frame. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in crucial production regions should drive the performance of Atmos Energy Corp., Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and MDU Resources Group.', 'The shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature steadily boosts demand for natural gas from all customer groups. Natural gas distribution pipelines are vital in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines. The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 2.3 million miles of underground distribution pipelines. Major concerns for the industry are aging infrastructure and rising investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. Competition from other clean energy sources can lower demand for natural gas and, consequently, for pipelines.', 'Production and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow to 105 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in the second half of 2023, increasing nearly 2 Bcf/d from the first half of 2023. Natural gas production is expected to increase 1.35% year over year to 105.1 Bcf/d in 2024. The increase in gas production volumes has improved from earlier forecasts of the EIA due to strong volumes from the Permian region.', 'Export volumes are expected to increase in 2023 and 2024, providing much relief to natural gas transporters. The EIA expects U.S. gross liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase nearly 11.3% year over year to 11.8 Bcf/d in 2023, and exports are expected to increase 4.2% to 12.3 Bcf/d in 2024. Per Playbook.AGA.org, the United States will reach a peak export capacity of 20 Bcf/d by 2025. This indicates the need for more pipelines to send LNG to export terminals.', 'Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States are driving demand for natural gas. The distribution network will continue to transport natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States. With three new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals.', 'Per the EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. Per Playbook.AGA.org, one residential customer signs up for natural gas service every minute and 80 businesses add natural gas service each day. As production and demand for natural gas increase, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the commodity to end-users.', ""Aging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may disrupt services. Natural gas distribution utilities currently provide services to over 80 million customers in the United States. Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. Per Playbook.Aga.org, natural gas utilities invest nearly $32 billion each year to improve the distribution network's safety."", 'To lower the possibility of service interruption, the Department of Energy announced $33 million in funding for ten projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing cast iron and bare steel pipes. The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile. Currently, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years.', ""The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

Using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology, this plant will be the first commercial scale, single-train advanced recycling plant to convert post-consumer plastic waste into feedstock for production of new plastic materials that can be ran at net zero GHG emissions. The new plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year and is designed to recycle the amount of plastic packaging waste generated by over 1.2 million German citizens per year. Construction is planned to be completed by the end of 2025."", '""We are committed to addressing the global challenge of plastic waste and advancing a circular economy, and today\'s announcement is another meaningful step in that direction,"" says Peter Vanacker, LYB CEO. ""Scaling up our catalytic advanced recycling technology will allow us to return larger volumes of plastic waste back into the value chain. By doing this, we will have the ability to produce more materials for high-quality applications, retaining value of plastics for as long as possible.""', 'The LYB MoReTec demonstration plant will close the gap for difficult to recycle plastics, such as mixed or flexible materials that are currently sent to landfill or incineration. Source One Plastics, a joint venture of LYB and 23 Oaks Investments formed in October 2022, will supply the majority of the sorted processed feedstock. The advanced recycled feedstock produced by the MoReTec facility will be used for the production of polymers sold by LYB under the CirculenRevive product line for use in a wide range of applications, including medical and food packaging.', 'The MoReTec difference', 'The MoReTec technology produces pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gas. Pyrolysis oil is a substitute for fossil-based materials used in polymer production. Typically, pyrolysis gas streams are consumed as a fuel, however, the MoReTec technology enables the pyrolysis gas to be recovered as well, contributing to the production of polymer and displacing fossil-based feedstocks, which lowers direct CO2 emissions.', 'In addition, the proprietary catalyst technology lowers the process temperature, reduces energy consumption and improves yield. With lower energy consumption, the process can be powered by electricity, including electricity from renewable sources at net zero GHG emissions.', 'These differentiating advantages provide a carbon footprint advantage as well. The recovery of pyrolysis gas as feedstock, lower energy demand, electrical heating design, displacement of fossil-feedstocks, and recovery of waste plastic from incineration or landfill result in a significantly lower carbon footprint compared with fossil-based processes. This makes MoReTec a unique value proposition.', ""ABOUT LYONDELLBASELL We are LyondellBasell (NYSE: LYB) - a leader in the global chemical industry creating solutions for everyday sustainable living.

If you want to skip our introduction to Mr. Watsa, his hedge fund, and the latest stock market news, then take a look at 5 Stocks Prem Watsa Just Bought and Sold. ', ""Prem Watsa is one of the lower profile fund bosses in the industry. A graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology and the University of Western Ontario, he was born in India and is a classic example of the potential of capitalism to turn one from rags to riches through dedication and the right business decisions. After graduating with an MBA in Canada, Mr. Watsa jumped into the financial world and started his stint at an insurance company. Soon after beginning his finance career, he started his own finance company and acquired an insurance company to rename the new firm Fairfax Financial. The term 'Fairfax' refers to 'fair, friendly acquisitions' and according to Insider Monkey's research, the firm had an investment portfolio worth $1.8 billion as of Q3 2023 end. This marks a sizeable drop over the $3.9 billion that the portfolio was worth as of September 2022."", ""Prem Watsa's firm, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited was officially set up in its current form in 1985. The firm's shares are also traded on the Canadian stock exchange under the ticker Fairfax Financial Holdings (TSE:FFH.TO). Being publicly traded is an integral part of Fairfax's financial philosophy and strategy since the firm seeks to deliver a minimum of 15% growth in its book value per share over the long term. Book value per share is defined as a firm's net asset value, i.e. its liabilities subtracted from its assets, per unit of outstanding stock. It is a commonly used financial metric that allows investors and analysts to analyze the worth of a firm or the money that is available to investors in case of a liquidation. Fairfax describes itself as being focused on the long term, and the firm touts that it has written a whopping $229 billion in insurance premiums over the past 37 years."", ""Since it's a publicly traded firm, SEC filings provide greater working into Fairfax Financial's affairs than would be possible for other hedge funds. The firm filed its earnings report for the third quarter with the SEC in November. The results showed that its insurance revenue during the quarter stood at a cool $7 billion and its non-insurance operations raked in $1 billion for a combined revenue of $7 billion. The insurance industry benefits when interest rates are high, and this was evident in Fairfax's latest earnings results as well since the company's profit after tax stood at $1.1 billion and nearly doubled from the year ago quarter's $582 million."", 'In terms of assets, Fairfax is quite a sizeable entity as well with total assets of $84 billion. Within this multi-billion-dollar asset pile, a large portion belongs to bonds as the company held a cool $34 billion in bonds. Stocks were its second largest holdings, and in Q3, Fairfax Financial held $8.9 billion in preferred and common stocks.', ""Shifting gears to analyze Prem Watsa's latest stock portfolio, its five biggest investments in Q3 ranged from energy to semiconductors, consumer electronics, mining, and real estate industries. In descending order, Fairfax Financial's biggest stock holdings in the third quarter were Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB), Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KW), and Orla Mining Ltd. (NYSE:ORLA). Cumulatively, these account for more than 60% of the $1.8 billion stock portfolio as Mr. Watsa's financial firm owned stakes worth $1.1 billion in the five companies."", 'Shifting gears to focus on the broader stock market climate during the third quarter, right now, optimism is abound. This is because investors are now making cautious bets that the Federal Reserve might be near the end of its interest rate cycle with some already making bets about when rates will start to come down. However, the road to low rates might be long, with fresh comments from some Fed officials culling optimistic stock rallies. For instance, the Chair of the Boston Fed Susan Collins is unwilling to rule out further rate hikes before additional data convinces her that the central bank has done enough. Speaking to CNBC, the Fed official shared:', ""In order to get back down to 2% (inflation) in a reasonable amount of time you need to be patient and resolute, and I wouldn't take additional firming off the table."", 'She went on to add:', ""I remain focused on really looking at kind of the full complement of information that we're getting and making assessments in real time about the right thing to do."", ""So, as investors flirt with the new interest rate era, what is one of Canada's richest financial wizards thinking? We took a look at his firm's stock portfolio to find out, and some stocks that caught our eye are Orla Mining Ltd. (NYSE:ORLA), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)."", 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of the stocks that Prem Watsa bought and sold, we divided Fairfax Financial's investment portfolio into two sections. The first section consisted of stocks that the firm initiated new positions in or piled more money into. The second was made of stocks that it sold or exited completely. Within these two lists, the stocks were ranked by the latest dollar value as of Q3 2023 or the value during Q2 2023, and the ones with the highest values were chosen as the stocks that Mr. Watsa is buying and selling."", ""Fairfax Financial's Q2 2023 Investment: $581,000 "", 'Bought Or Sold: Bought ', 'Percentage Increase or (-)Decrease: New Addition ', 'United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is an American steel company headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Contract wins from federal or state authorities also contribute to membership and premium growth. An aging population will continue to keep demand for health insurers’ Medicare plans high in the future. Industry players resort to a merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy and technology advancements to enhance capabilities. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH are well-placed to gain from the industry’s favorable growth prospects.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign health and medical insurance policy premiums. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.', '4 Trends Shaping the Future of the HMO Industry', 'A Growing Premium Base: The industry participants devise affordable health insurance plans and infuse them with some eye-catching features to boost the lucrativeness of such plans and stand out from their peers. By extending such beneficial plans across several U.S. communities, the health insurers enjoy a growing membership base. This, in turn, fetches them with a steady flow of premiums — the most significant contributor to revenues of any health insurer. The strength of these plans fetches numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from federal or state authorities. However, the resumption of elective procedures, which were deferred to keep beds open for a humongous number of COVID patients, in full swing poses a concern for health insurers. An uptick in elective surgeries implies the need to address a higher number of claims from plan members. This would elevate costs, but the financial strength and diversified operations are expected to provide a shield to the industry participants from such headwinds.', 'A Rising Greying Population: The Medicare plans are intended to cater to people aged 65 or above. An aging U.S. population is likely to sustain the solid demand for the plans in the days ahead. Per the leading market and consumer data provider, Statista, around 17.3% of Americans were 65 years or above in 2020. The percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. Industry participants can, therefore, make use of the Medicare plans to welcome more members of the rapidly growing senior population and grow its customer base. They contract with an extensive network of healthcare providers, which can be physician groups, hospitals, ancillary providers, and pharmacies, to deliver quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.', 'Technological Advancements: The industry continues to undertake significant investments in developing virtual healthcare solutions (more commonly referred to as telehealth services) in order to embrace the digitization trend being infused across every sphere of life. These services enable patients to receive care from the comfort of their homes and thereby reduce the mounting burden on the U.S. healthcare system arising from frequent patient admissions. Such technologies, therefore, boost operational efficiencies and reduce costs for the industry participants. Though tech investments might result in escalating costs for health insurers, virtual services continue to fetch regular revenues and enable them to achieve a competitive edge over their peers.', 'An Active M&A Strategy: The health insurers resort to an M&A strategy for upgrading their product and services portfolio that will fetch them a growing number of members. Such initiatives are also meant to expand the global presence and bring diversification benefits to health insurers, which are crucial to strengthening one’s market position. However, continued rate hikes by the Fed in order to tame inflation may have thrown a roadblock to health insurers’ pursuit of an M&A strategy, considering the rising borrowing costs that make people reluctant to opt for loans for financing M&A deals.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Instills Optimism', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #61, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.', 'Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are upbeat about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 1.5% from the past year.

But you don’t need to worry about a strike screwing up your holiday travel plans.', 'Airline employees are covered by the Railway Labor Act. Despite its name, the RLA covers both rail workers and airline employees and has significant differences from the labor law that regulates other US businesses. Most notably, it places severe restrictions on the ability of airline or railroad employees to go on strike when a contract expires.', 'The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents more than 23,000 members at American has not overcome any of the many legal hurdles it needs to conquer before the union could strike. That’s the case even though union members have not gotten a raise since 2019.', 'If federally mediated union negotiations reach a point where no progress is being made at the table, the union or company management can ask federal meditators involved in talks to declare an “impasse.” The union can go on strike or management can lock out union workers only after a 30-day cooling off period that follows an impasse being declared.', 'That declaration of an impasse is what the union is arguing should happen now.', '“The company has staked out a firm position on economic matters, and APFA has been clear that the company’s economic framework does not and will not work,” APFA President Julie Hedrick wrote in a letter to the federal agency overseeing talks. “No amount of future bargaining will change that, absent a release into a thirty-day cooling-off period.”', 'But American Airlines argued Monday that there is no impasse in talks and that negotiations should continue.', '“Since resuming negotiations in 2021, the company has routinely met with APFA and presented proposals that maintain our commitment to paying our team members well and competitively,” said the airline’s statement. “For months now, we’ve had an industry-leading economic proposal on the table, and we continue to make progress on other items, including as recently as last week. We stand ready to continue working with APFA… to reach an agreement that our flight attendants have earned.”', 'But even if the union gets its way and the federal mediators start the clock ticking towards a strike 30 day from now, there are additional barriers in the law that likely would block a strike from starting just before the year-end holidays.', 'The two sides are clearly still at odds. The union is demanding an immediate 35% pay raise and back pay, dating back to 2019. It also wants two additional 6% raises over the three-year life of the contract it is proposing.', 'The union says that American is offering its members an immediate 11% raise and additional 2% raises each year of a proposed five-year contract. The company did not respond to a request for comment on details of its offer.', 'But even if the flight attendants win their request to have the clock start ticking towards a strike 30 days from now, a strike then is not likely. The RLA would allow President Joe Biden to step in at the last moment and order workers to stay on the job for two additional month-long “cooling off periods” while a presidential panel comes up with recommendations as to how to settle the deadlock.', 'Despite Biden clearly siding with labor in some recent strikes, including the United Auto Workers union’s strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, he’s not going to stand by and allow the nation’s largest airline to be shutdown right before the Christmas holiday.', 'If the two sides can’t reach a deal during that 60-day period, the union could then go on strike — but only if Congress stays on the sideline and allows the strike to take place. But it’s possible, and in the case of American Airlines, likely, that Congress would act to block a strike. That’s what happened with the freight railroads last December when Congress imposed a contract on the angry rail unions to keep the railroads operating.', 'It’s unlikely that Congress would allow any of the four major carriers to go on strike. When Southwest had a service meltdown over the holidays that forced it to ground more than half its scheduled flights, it sparked a Congressional hearing to look into the problem.', 'This doesn’t mean that the union and its members aren’t serious about going on strike if given the chance. Flight attendants have not only gone years without a raise, they’ve seen their jobs get significantly more difficult with a rise in disruptive, sometimes violent, passengers. AFPA said that in August 99.5% of members voted to authorize a strike, with 93% of members participating in the vote.', 'And the union’s demands are close to what other union groups have been winning in negotiations recently. Last month, flight attendants at Southwest Airlines won an immediate 20% raise, with retroactive pay. American recently agreed to a deal with the Allied Pilots Association, its pilots union, that gave those members an immediate 21% raise and pay increases topping 40% over the four-year life of that agreement.', 'There have been airline strikes in the past, but because of the hurdle, they are very rare and generally with relatively small carriers.', 'Spirit Airlines pilots struck for a week in 2010, but the airline was much smaller then, with only about 1% of domestic air traffic at that time.', 'The last time a major airline was grounded by a strike was 25 years ago when Northwest Airlines pilots went on strike for two weeks. Northwest was then the fourth largest US airline, but back then there was far less consolidation in the industry.', 'Since 1998, the 11 largest US airlines have merged to become the four largest carriers today, including Southwest and American. Those two, along with Delta and United, carry about 80% of US air traffic between them.', 'And strike votes, in and of themselves, don’t mean that a union is going to go on strike.', 'Strike votes are a common negotiating tactic taken during talks. They virtually always pass by an overwhelming margin. But most negotiations are settled, even after a strike vote, without a work stoppage. Pilots at Delta, United and Southwest all approved strike votes, and quickly reached contracts with their significant raises without an impasse being declared in any of the talks.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

They're really cracking down some of those prices because they're trying to make up for what happened during the pandemic. We'll see if that could maybe correct itself moving forward."", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I want to quickly add that Pete Buttigieg just tweeted out today about this saying, hey, we've put in rules in place, if the airline cancels your flight and it's not your fault, you get hotel, you have meal vouchers, make sure you ask for it.

While the Greek philosophers were attempting to unearth the truth through intellectual discourse, they would often do so with a cup of wine in hand, and plenty more waiting in a nearby carafe. This ‘symposium’ – which literally translates to ‘drinking with others’ –\xa0 was an intellectual gathering where the wise men of ancient Greece would collect around a table and allow the conversation and wine to flow freely. However, getting inebriated was never the end goal, as maintaining composure and self-control was (and still is) highly valued in Greek society. So in order to maintain the delicate balance between inspiration and intoxication, the wine was usually heavily diluted with water. In fact, drinking unmixed wine was considered very uncivilized – a trait particular to the ‘Barbarians’.\xa0', 'Wine is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World. As we mentioned in our article – Top 20 Wine Producing Countries in the World\xa0– the global wine market size was valued at $441.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of $698.54 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 5.9% over the forecast period.\xa0', 'Wine is gaining huge popularity among millennials and youngsters, owing to its refreshing appeal and low ABV offerings. The rising demand for premium and luxury wines, increasing consumer awareness about the health benefits of wine, and growing popularity of wine tourism are some of the key factors driving the growth of the wine market.', 'The global wine consumption in 2022 was estimated to be at 232 million hectoliters, marking a decrease of 1% compared to the previous year. Since 2018, wine consumption around the world has decreased at a regular rate. This negative trend can be mainly attributed to the decline in China’s consumption, which has lost an average 2 million hectoliters per year since 2018. This downward trend was further accentuated in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic, which negatively affected many large wine markets.\xa0', 'In 2022, the war in Ukraine and the associated energy crisis, together with the global supply chain disruptions, led to a spike in costs in production and distribution. This has resulted in a significant increase in wine prices for the consumers.\xa0', 'People travel around the world for different reasons. Some travel to explore new cultures, learn new languages, admire unique locations, and some to drink wine. Among several types of modern tourism, wine tourism is a new concept with a focus on exploring wine cultures around the world.\xa0', 'The U.S. wine industry is a major magnet for tourists and tourism-driven expenses.

Many airlines go the extra mile to make sure their customers are pampered and serve impressive brands like Dom Pérignon and Laurent Perrier.\xa0', 'However, the Covid-19 pandemic brought the airline industry to its knees, forcing a multitude of carriers to adopt various cost-cutting measures in order to survive. The pandemic has come and gone, but the cost-cutting mindset seems to have remained. The American Airlines Group Inc.

Instead, the company’s new standard option is a cheaper Ferrari Brut Trento DOC, an Italian sparkling wine.', 'Most passengers of the American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) may not mind the switch, but the company is part of the Oneworld Alliance, with many of its partner airlines making food service a key focus of their flight experience. The difference in luxuries that passengers experience when boarding one of these airlines as part of a connecting flight could potentially irk them.', 'However, the stringent cost-cutting measures seem to be bearing fruit for the company, and although the American Airlines Group has suffered from over-expenditure and the resultant losses in the past, the carrier witnessed a net profit of $127 million last year, with a revenue of $48.97 billion.

You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime.', ""Experienced investors often stress that patience is crucial in investing, and they're definitely right about that. Being patient means looking at investments for the long haul and not rushing into decisions. The most successful investors take their time, study markets and trends, and only decide after watching things for a while. Being patient pays off big time, leading to more success and stability in the long run. A Middlefield Investments report analyzed the S&P 500's total return from December 31, 1992, to December 31, 2022, splitting it into two parts. Out of the total return of +1,481%, 47% came from dividends and reinvested dividends, while 53% was from the increase in stock prices. This shows that patient investors gain a lot from the compounding effect by investing in companies that consistently pay and increase their dividends over time."", ""The same report from the Canada-based equity income manager also mentioned that dividends act as a strong defense against inflation. High-quality companies often adjust their prices to safeguard their earnings from inflation. This helps them maintain their dividend payments consistently even through different market cycles. That's why dividends played a bigger role in total returns (more than 50%) during inflation-heavy decades like the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s. It highlights why dividends continue to be a key source for competitive long-term returns for shareholders. On the flip side, other options for yield, like fixed income, can suffer significant losses during high inflation periods."", ""The blend of yields and dividend growth is a powerful combination that benefits investors in multiple ways. High yields offer an immediate income stream, providing a steady cash flow, which can be particularly valuable in volatile markets or during economic downturns. Meanwhile, companies with a history of consistent dividend growth often signal financial strength and stability. As these companies increase their dividends over time, investors not only enjoy a rising income but also benefit from the compounding effect, amplifying their returns. That said, analysts stress the importance of maintaining a healthy dividend yield to benefit investors because excessively high yields often indicate underlying financial issues within a company. Historical analysis showed that these stocks have performed better than the overall market in the past. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series, which tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks in each market with a record of consistently paying dividends, achieved an average annual return of 11.7% between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, considering reinvested dividends. This outperformed its benchmark's 10.2% return during the same period, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices."", ""In addition to generating strong returns, dividend-growing companies often possess the capacity to expand their revenues consistently. These companies typically exhibit strong fundamentals and effective business models. The commitment to sustaining and increasing dividends often aligns with a company's ability to generate steady cash flows and profitability. This financial stability allows them to reinvest profits back into the business, fostering growth initiatives that drive revenue expansion. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are some of the best stocks as these companies have shown strong revenue growth over the years and have also raised their dividends for decades.

Starting Nov. 20, consumers can post a Pepsi Mini Can paired with their favorite food on social media for a chance to win a basketball signed by O’Neal.', 'Decades after first collaborating, Pepsi and Shaq are back together with a campaign that highlights the soft drink marketer’s mini-sized cans. A look back to past work with the NBA icon ties into Pepsi’s ongoing 125th-anniversary celebration, which began earlier in the fall and spans 125 days of promotions. The media blitz also serves as the official introduction of the brand’s first visual overhaul in 14 years.', 'Nostalgia has been a major focus for Pepsi as it examines over a century in consumer culture and tries to usher in a new look. The 125th-anniversary campaign has recently seen Pepsi revive vintage ads featuring music stars like Ray Charles, Madonna and Tina Turner.', '“Dipping into nostalgia, which we know consumers love, is helping us build that foundation that [Pepsi] has always been a forward-looking brand, has always been celebrating the next generation of culture creators and has always been launching the next generation of products,” said Jenny Danzi, senior director for Pepsi Trademark, in an interview with Marketing Dive.', 'The new 60-second commercial depicts O’Neal comically struggling with tasks that are often considered one-size-fits-all, like sitting comfortably on an airplane or fitting lengthwise on a bed. The theme echoes similar messaging to that of the athlete’s “Big Slam” ad from the ‘90s.', 'The latest spot is soundtracked by “I Wish” by Skee-Lo, who makes a cameo appearance, and notably features a twist on the song’s popular refrain “I wish I was a little bit taller” to become “I wish I was a little bit smaller.”\xa0Instead of promoting the discontinued Big Slam soda — which was unique to Pepsi’s partnership with O’Neal — the athlete is now seen promoting Pepsi Mini Cans as the just-right size for any occasion.', 'The use of Skee-Lo’s popular tune is meant to tap into the culture surrounding music, a cornerstone for Pepsi, according to Danzi.', '“Pepsi plays in music and in sports and across a lot of facets of culture, but music was something that we talked a lot about as we went through the archives,” said Danzi.', 'The commercial can be viewed on Pepsi’s YouTube channel and will air on linear TV during select national NBA games on TNT and ESPN beginning Nov. 22. Additionally, the creative will run during NBC’s primetime NFL line-up on Thanksgiving. O’Neal will market Pepsi Mini Cans through 2024, Danzi said, though the executive declined to share further details.', 'Consumers beginning Nov. 20 can also enter to win an official NBA basketball signed by O’Neal by tagging Pepsi on social media in a photo sharing their favorite food paired with a Pepsi mini can with the hashtags #BetterWithPepsiMinis and #Sweepstakes. The move ties into a “Better with Pepsi” platform introduced in 2021 that’s meant to elevate Pepsi as the ideal pairing with foods.', 'Other activations this year under the platform have included a Pepsi 125 Diner concept in New York City in October, a cola-infused condiment for July Fourth and ads that suggest consumers prefer its product paired with rum over competitor Coke.', 'This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.
