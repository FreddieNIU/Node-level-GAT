If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you may go directly to the 10 Best Places to Retire in Florida.The Sunny State of FloridaThe U.S. population growth has nearly flatlined. 2021 saw a growth of less than a million people, while a tepid 0.38% increase followed between 2021 and 2022. The population is not only living longer at 79 years on average, but it's also reproducing below the replacement rate at 1.9 births per woman. As the population ages, fewer working people will be left behind to support a growing number of retirees.The state that has been an outlier in terms of population growth, however, is Florida. This sunny state has continued witnessing an increase in population since the 1940s. Warmer temperatures, beaches, and lack of an income tax are increasingly drawing both the working population and retirees to the state. Today, the population in the southeastern state tops 22 million people.The U.S. Census Bureau reports that 21% of the population comprises seniors aged 60 and older. While seniors and retirees contribute the same per capita revenue to their states — their per capita expenses are comparatively smaller. According to Good Life Home Loans, the average monthly retirement income in the state is $6,100 monthly or $73,000 annually. This amount is slightly less than the average household income of Floridians, which stands at $88,267 annually.Smaller incomes translate to slightly smaller spending on taxable goods. However, this cohort is the most to buy valuable homes. Therefore, while the retiree population may be contributing lesser to sales and gross receipts and sales taxes, they end up paying more in property taxes.Moreover, they tend to have no children in the house, so there's no pressure on the education budget either. Medical expenses are more needed for this age group, but their lesser demand for other services offsets it. All in all, the retiree population brings good wherever it goes, and Florida is the one state it still loves more than anything else. However, the continuous surge in population in the state may not be a pretty sight in the future.Story continuesFlorida: Losing the Middle-Class Boomer StatusFortune reports that wealthy Americans are moving to Florida at 4 times the rate compared to other states. The surge in population has driven up housing costs by a massive 73.5% over the past few years. Median home prices in Florida as of April 2023 have been hovering around $410,000. These figures show a massive turn of events, considering that in 2019, the real estate prices in Florida were less than the U.S. average. Inflation rates haven’t been showing mercy on the sunny state either. While the rest of the nation witnessed a 6.4% hike from December 2021-22, Boward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade metro areas saw as high rates as 9.9%. Tampa's inflation rates have been particularly high, too, at 8.9%.Other factors accounting for the cost of living, such as food and energy, have been showing similar trends. For the 12 months ending December 2022, the food index for South Florida rose by 8.8%, while energy saw an increase of 5.2% for the same period. All in all, the sunshine state may be losing out on its middle-class boomer status as the wealthier take over.Retirement accounts and 401(k) plans can help potential retirees materialize their plans for retiring in the sunshine state. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) are a few examples of companies offering Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to individuals. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) allows individuals to open savings IRAs in both traditional and Roth.Moreover, individuals can also open investment IRAs through Merrill Edge, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) also offer different retirement accounts depending on user needs. You can also seek financial advice from Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

You may have heard financial experts say that you should draw 4% of your total portfolio in your first year for retirement spending. After that, you can adjust withdrawals based on cost-of-living increases. If inflation increases living costs by 2%, the next year, you should withdraw 4.08% (which is 2% of the original 4%) of your portfolio.Retirement Savings: Experts Say This Magic Number Is the Key — and It’s Not $1 MillionLearn: 3 Ways To Recession-Proof Your RetirementTheoretically, following this pattern would give you enough money for a 30-year retirement.However, as people live longer, 30 years’ worth of savings may not be enough for a comfortable retirement. And, as you age, your costs for things like travel may go down, while healthcare costs will rise.Following a rigid 4% rule doesn’t leave flexibility for lifestyle changes — or fluctuations in the market. Investment firm Schwab.com points out, in an article about the 4% rule, that the calculations are based on a very specific type of portfolio, one that is a mix of 50% stocks and 50% bonds and is based on historical market returns. Returns for stocks and bonds over the next decade are likely to fall below those long-term averages, according to the Charles Schwab Investment Advisory.Instead, experts suggest customizing your retirement plan and spending. MSN.com recommends three new retirement rules to follow.Follow the 2% Rule for a Long RetirementIf you are retiring early — or if you are living a healthy lifestyle and have a history of longevity in your family — you may want to make retirement withdrawals more conservatively. Experts recommend beginning your first year by withdrawing 2% of your portfolio to ensure your portfolio will last.Schwab also suggests considering how much security and peace-of-mind is important to you. We save for retirement so that we don’t have to worry about being able to live comfortably in our later years. If you have other sources of income, besides social security, to draw from or if you are willing to reduce spending in retirement if necessary, you can spend more early on.Story continuesSchwab recommends targeting a 75% to 90% confidence level as a safe balance between overspending and underspending. Of course, how much you withdraw will depend on your total portfolio.Follow the 3% Rule for an Average RetirementIf you are fairly confident you won’t run out of money, begin by withdrawing 3% of your portfolio annually. Adjust based on inflation but keep an eye on the market, as well.Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?Social Security: 20% Cuts to Your Payments May Come Sooner Than ExpectedPrepare to Adjust Withdrawals Based on Market ReturnsThe final rule isn’t a rule, at all, but a reminder to be flexible. The guidelines above can help give you a good idea of how much you’ll need to save for retirement. But, ultimately, how much you withdraw each year for retirement will be a balance between how much you need and how much you can afford.You may need to withdraw less, some years, simply based on the market’s behavior and the stability of your portfolio. Experts recommend re-evaluating your withdrawals and living expenses annually, or after any significant life changes such as a move or a major illness, to help your retirement investments last as long as you do.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Get Advice3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000What's the Best Small Business in Your State?

(RJF) Up 3.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financial-inc-rjf-153146179.html,1685115106,STORY,"['RJF', 'SCHW']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF). Shares have added about 3.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Raymond James Financial, Inc. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Raymond James Q2 Earnings Miss on Muted IBRaymond James’ second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31) adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 by a considerable margin. The bottom line, however, was up 25% from the prior-year quarter. We had projected adjusted earnings per share of $2.15.A weak investment banking performance amid heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic ambiguities hurt the Capital Markets segment’s results. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter on the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. Further, expenses increased during the quarter.Yet, higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a substantial jump in net interest income. Further, the performance of the Private Client Group was robust. Also, the acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $425 million, up 32% year over year.Revenues &amp; Costs RiseNet revenues were $2.87 billion, up 7% year over year. The top line, however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88 billion. Our estimate for net revenues was the same as the consensus number.Segment-wise, in the reported quarter, RJ Bank registered a surge of 174% from the prior year in net revenues. Also, the Private Client Group recorded 12% growth in net revenues. Capital Markets’ top line declined 27%, while Asset Management’s net revenues fell 8%. Others recorded revenues of $10 million against negative revenues of $18 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses rose 3% to $2.32 billion. Our estimate for non-interest expense was $2.27 billion. Also, RJF recorded a bank loan provision for credit losses of $28 million, up from $21 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Mar 31, 2023, client assets under administration were $1.22 trillion, down 3% from the end of the prior-year quarter. Financial assets under management of $194.4 billion were relatively stable.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet &amp; Capital RatiosAs of Mar 31, 2023, Raymond James reported total assets of $79.18 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. Total equity grew 1% sequentially to $9.88 billion.Book value per share was $46.67, up from $41.38 as of Mar 31, 2022.As of Mar 31, 2023, total capital ratio was 21.4% compared with 25% as of Mar 31, 2022. Tier 1 capital ratio was 20.1% compared with 23.9% as of March 2022-end.Return on common equity (annualized basis) was 17.3% at the end of the reported quarter compared with 15% a year ago.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, RJF repurchased 3.75 million shares for $350 million.OutlookThe company expects combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to decline sequentially in the fiscal third quarter of 2023 due to a decrease in third-party RJBDP fees given the lower average balances with third-party banks.Management expects the bank segments NIM in the fiscal third quarter to contract from the second quarter given the higher level of cash balances it plans to maintain during the volatile period as well as the impact from higher cost diversified funding sources.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Raymond James Financial, Inc. has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Charles Schwab with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab How Fast Is Charles Schwab Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Charles Schwab grew its EPS by 14% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Charles Schwab's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Charles Schwab maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$21b. That's encouraging news for the company!Story continuesThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Charles Schwab's future EPS 100% free.Are Charles Schwab Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$99b company like Charles Schwab. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.4b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Is Charles Schwab Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Charles Schwab is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership.

One such stock is U.S. Bancorp USB.The Minneapolis, MN-based bank was formed in 2001 with the merger of the former U.S. Bancorp and Firstar Corporation. USB provides a wide range of banking and investment services throughout the Midwest and West regions of the United States.U.S. Bancorp has been increasing its quarterly dividend on a regular basis, with the last hike of 4.3% to 48 cents per share announced in September 2022. Over the past five years, the company increased its dividend four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 7.47%.Considering the last day’s closing price of $30.51, U.S. Bancorp’s dividend yield currently stands at 6.29%. This is impressive compared with the industry average of 4.59% and attractive for income investors as it represents a steady income stream.U.S. Bancorp Dividend Yield (TTM)U.S. Bancorp Dividend Yield (TTM)U.S. Bancorp dividend-yield-ttm | U.S. Bancorp QuoteIs the U.S. Bancorp stock worth a look to earn a high dividend yield? Let’s check out the company financials to understand the risks and rewards. This will help us make a proper investment decision.U.S. Bancorp remains focused on its organic growth strategy. Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.3% over the four-year period ended 2022. This rise was due to higher net interest income (NII) with some annual volatility.The rising momentum continued in first-quarter 2023. Management expects total revenues to reach $28.5-$30.5 billion in 2023. Also, U.S. Bancorp’s efforts to enhance its range of products, services and capabilities will support fee income growth in the upcoming period.Over the past few years, the bank recorded strong growth in average loans and deposits, as it continued to expand and deepen relationships with current customers, as well as acquired new customers and market share. Average deposits and loans witnessed a three-year CAGR of 10.5% and 14.6%, respectively, in 2022. The rising trend for both metrics continued in first-quarter 2023. For second-quarter and full-year 2023, the company expects average earning assets in the range of $600-$605 billion and $600-$610 billion, respectively.Story continuesUSB has grown through a series of acquisitions over the years. In December 2022, U.S. Bancorp completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. In December 2021, USB completed the deal to acquire PFM Asset Management, which was carried out through U.S. Bancorp Asset Management. These mentioned acquisitions have strengthened the company’s balance sheet and fee-based businesses.Hence, despite near-term headwinds like rising expenses and notable exposure to risky loans, USB stock is fundamentally solid. So far this year, shares of U.S Bancorp have plunged 30% compared with the industry's fall of 9.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTherefore, income investors should keep this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock on their radar as this will help generate robust returns over time.

The company has witnessed dismal performance in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Results were impacted by a more broad-based pressure across the business, driven by softened demand versus expectations. A deflation in lumber prices and unfavorable weather have also hurt the results.

Americans are struggling even amid ongoing student loan forbearance that’s about to end, which will bring about yet more financial strain.Home improvement giants announce unusual sales guidance reductionsHome Depot and Lowe’s, the two largest home improvement retailers, both cut their full-year sales guidance after just one quarter of the year. For perspective, excluding Q1 2020 (when the pandemic broke out), Home Depot hadn’t cut its full-year sales guidance in Q1 dating back at least to 2006. Lowe’s last did so in 2011 based on our research.Home Depot reported store comparable sales in the U.S. declined by 4.6% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year, while comparable sales at Lowe’s declined by 4.3%.Discretionary spending under major pressureBoth Walmart and Target reported a slowdown in sales trends in March and April compared to January and February. Walmart pointed to SNAP benefit reductions and lower tax refunds. An uptick in Social Security benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments as a result of the annual cost-of-living adjustment offset some of those pressures.Walmart experienced pronounced weakness in its general merchandise sales, which exclude food and beverage. On its May 18 earnings call, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said continued inflation in grocery items and other necessities is forcing consumers to spend less on discretionary goods — a trend that’s expected to continue through 2023.Story continues“The persistently high rates of inflation in these categories lasting for such a long period of time are weighing on some of the families we serve,” McMillon said. “This stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically general merchandise.”Despite these challenges, Walmart raised its sales forecast for 2023.Target CEO Brian Cornell also noted that more expensive essentials have forced consumers to cut back.“[Consumers are] investing more in those household essentials and food and beverage items, and they’re shopping more cautiously when it comes to all things discretionary,” Cornell said in a call with reporters, according to a Yahoo Finance article.Dollar Tree reported an uptick in same-store sales in Q1 2023, but the discount retailer nonetheless cut its full-year earnings guidance, owing to the impact of elevated shrink (most commonly theft) and the shift from discretionary items to daily essentials.“I think the consumer is feeling the real pressure now of a lot of things that have taken place,” Rick Dreiling, Dollar Tree chairman and CEO, said. “We’ve had change in SNAP benefits, tax returns are smaller than this time last year, all the stimulus is out of the system, and all of that is taking root, and the consumer now is more focused on needs and buying to those needs as close as they can versus wants.”Foot Locker slashed its sales outlook for 2023, pointing to “the tough economic backdrop, causing us to reduce our guidance for the year as we take more aggressive markdowns to both drive demand and manage inventory.”BJ’s Wholesale Club President and CEO Bob Eddy talked about customers’ reluctance to buy almost anything “big ticket,” like televisions or patio furniture, noting that “it’s a very picky consumer out there at this point from a high-ticket perspective.”Best Buy topped consensus earnings estimates in its fiscal Q1, though its sales fell short of consensus and the company noted recessionary behavior.“I think what we would say is we’ve been seeing a consumer who is, whether or not you call it a recession, exhibiting some recessionary behaviors depending on the different category that you’re talking about. So it’s absolutely unusual,” CEO Corey Barry said on Best Buy’s earnings call.The company noted a heightened level of promotional activity in certain categories, in some cases “even more promotional than they were pre-pandemic.” Best Buy highlighted appliances, computers and headphones as among the categories under the most pressure along those lines, discretionary ones all.Costco reported its fiscal Q3 results Thursday, missing consensus on both sales and earnings. Its U.S. comparable sales excluding changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange were up 1.8% in the 12 weeks ended May 7, well below the 6% growth rate in the first six months of its fiscal year.As did a host of other retailers this earnings season, Costco noted the strength in nondiscretionary/essential items and weakness in big-ticket discretionary ones. The company is seeing greater promotional activity as is Best Buy and noted on its conference call that it has seen consumers trading down from beef to chicken and even to products such as canned chicken, canned tuna, etc.And RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) said Thursday it will have to take deeper markdowns than it previously expected because of deteriorating demand.More consumer pain aheadWhile retailers pointed to the impact from SNAP benefit reductions and lower tax refunds as among the reasons for the spending weakness, there are other major potential problems ahead.The end of the student loan forbearance, banking crisis and potential ramifications of the debt ceiling negotiations (in terms of spending caps or cuts) could put further strain on Americans’ budgets, which are already under substantial pressure judging by these retailers’ comments.The post Retailers’ commentary becoming ever more downbeat as Americans run out of money appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

It stays in focus with results from Costco, the warehouse chain, showing it is not immune to choosier shoppers who bought fewer bulk items last quarter. Same store sales growth slowed. Back in February, CFO Richard Galanti warned investors over weakness in big ticket discretionary items, and this is a theme that we have seen across the sector in the last few weeks.Joining us now, Oliver Chen, Cowen senior research analyst. Oliver, good morning. What a pleasure to see you here this morning. Let's talk about Costco a little bit here because we did have in particular the US comparable sales excluding fuel that did not rise as much as estimated. What's going on here? One would think that Costco could do well in this environment.OLIVER CHEN: Julie, great being here. Happy holidays as well. So at Costco we are really excited about the continuation of exceptional value, high quality. What's really distinguished here is traffic continues to be positive at 3.5%. But what you brought up earlier, Julie, big ticket items, big and bulky home electronics, that's been a tougher negative category, and that's particularly vulnerable online as about half of those items are big and bulky.On the other hand, food, essentials, that's working really well at Costco. We continue to love it as our top idea, Costco at large. It's actually a very simple model. In many ways it's not even a retailer. It's a membership model. And all customers are looking for value. So structurally, it's one of the best merchants in the industry. And this is one of America's few exports globally in terms of retail.Story continuesOne of the big facts of Costco is they only have 3,500 to 4,000 SKUs. That compares to 200,000 plus at Walmart. Having that assortment is quite powerful, and everybody likes the Kirkland brand. That's about 30% of the business mix. That's compelling too, having that unique private label.DIANE KING HALL: So Oliver, I got to ask you-- Diane here. So you say continues to be one of your top ideas. You also cover Walmart, so how does this compare to a Walmart? You would think that you would see kind of similar strength in Costco compared to Walmart, but it looks different to me. What's your assessment?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, at Walmart we're also excited by the momentum in grocery. Walmart is the US's leading grocer. It's about 60% grocery. That's a key positive. But as you think about Walmart, we think about a retail ecosystem, which means digital advertising, financial services, health and wellness. The GLP-1 drugs also helped Walmart's numbers too.Walmart offers everyday low value. That's a core theme at Costco as well. Costco has a higher income customer. But what's happening at Walmart with curbside pickup, with the American Express deals, with Walmart Plus, they're also attracting higher income customers too. But as you know, 90% of America is within 10 miles of a Walmart, so it's very much America in terms of who it broadcasts to.But as we think about Costco, it's a core membership model with a very fixed quantitative low markup, so you really can't get a better deal. As you think about Walmart, you think about a company that's bricks, clicks, and portals as well as a broader technology company with a very well-run grocery system as well. So we like that. And then bigger picture thematically for investors, we like what we call the bow tie thesis. So own LVMH and luxury as well as own deep value.JULIE HYMAN: Speaking of which, you should be wearing a bow tie today for your theme, Oliver as you have I think on occasion. I am interested in that thesis, and I'm interested in what you have to say about luxury. but I got to ask you about something else first, and that is, quote unquote, shrink, the theft that we have been hearing about time and time again during this earnings season. Ulta was the most recent that talked about it, but we heard it from Dollar Tree, we heard it from Target as well. What is going on in retail America, and why does it seem like the retailers are having so much trouble stopping it?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, unfortunately it's been worse than expected. So as we look ahead, the plan is for more labor as well as working on fixture. And this was a big charge at Target. It was $500 million. It also led to impact of Ulta's SG&amp;A margins. So the impact is very real.What really needs to happen is collaboration across the government, companies, society, products. Collaboration likely needs to happen. I don't think there's an easy solution to this, and it continues to evolve. But unfortunately it's gotten worse, and it's been quite material in terms of the margins and what stores have to do largely in terms of investing in additional labor.DIANE KING HALL: And of course, Oliver, to your point also about, say, Target's hit from this issue, Ulta has prominent placement in Target. Let's widen out in terms of Ulta. What was your overall assessment of their results this latest quarter?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, we've loved Ulta as a long-term idea. What we have been cautious about is peakish margins because this company has performed great. Investing in your face, wellness, that's been a long-term trend. Also cosmetics and skincare are doing great. That being said, last night was tough with the margin profile.As you mentioned, Diane, thinking about the shrink and what it did to operating margins, that was a negative. Also we're starting to see an uptick in promotions. That's also not good too in terms of thinking about the margins. And this is also a story of a company that's continued to hold on to great gains throughout the pandemic as people really think about self-care. So we're encouraged for the long term.But what happened in terms of expectations being very high, peakish operating margins running at 14% to 15%, as well as an attractive valuation, that caused some caution into the print in terms of how they printed relative to expectations. It's the Home Depot for women. It's a unique concept. They have a very good loyalty program.You know, as we think about loyalty, artificial intelligence intersects very strongly with loyalty and really how much data you collect. Augmented reality is actually working in beauty as you sample different shades online as well, so we're excited about that sector at large. And the consumer puts wellness as well as beauty together. And also as we think about Gen Z, it's a very ethnic sector-- a very ethnic population. So beauty plays well into what's happening with the beauty enthusiast as well as social media.JULIE HYMAN: And Oliver-- by the way I love that Home Depot for women analogy.DIANE KING HALL: So did I.JULIE HYMAN: Let's get to the bow tie and, in particular, the fancy part, I guess, of the bow tie or what some people would call a barbell approach, the LVMH and Richemonts of the world. LVMH, such an interesting story because, of course, became the first European company to top $500 billion in market cap, but it's well below that now because of the recent route in the shares due to concerns over growth in China. Is that something that you're concerned about? Can it reattain that $500 billion in pretty short order, do you think?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah. Health care has the number one biotech expert and health care team. We just had [INAUDIBLE] on very moments ago. The XBB variant is happening in China now, but we don't expect closures actually. So the stock's had a shock last week, but this could be a great buying opportunity.LVMH is our top European idea. You know, you've known me for a long time, Julie. We've loved LVMH for many years. It has $10 billion of marketing spend. It's the biggest market cap company in Europe. Having that much marketing spend combined with power brands-- the Louis Vuitton brand runs at a 40% plus margin. You get Sephora which is a premier beauty retailer, and you also get Dior as well as Tiffany.So you're getting a broad array of power brands that have reached extreme tipping points where they can spend a lot on advertising and promotion. And we've seen attractive price leverage at the high end as consumers go out again and as the Louis Vuitton and Dior brands just continue to reinvent themselves with lots of innovation. Our new creative artist Pharrell Williams joined LV as well. So all those things have-- lead to sustainable long-term growth. And he's doing a great job managing capital.In many ways, LVMH is an asset manager of a portfolio of brands for the very long term. We're excited about that. And as we think bigger picture, the Chinese consumer, the emerging market there, it's a big important driver given that it's about 25% to 30% of revenues and 30% to 50% of growth contribution longer term. But again, at the high end, that customer is very strong. We're worried about what we call the aspirational consumer, the more entry level luxury consumer. We've seen cracks there, and that's been true in the US as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, that makes sense if we're getting all the recession talk that we have been. Oliver, always great to get your perspective. A lot of different tickers and stocks for people to keep an eye on in that discussion. Oliver Chen is Cowen senior research analyst.

(RJF) Up 3.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financial-inc-rjf-153146179.html,1685115106,STORY,"['RJF', 'SCHW']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF). Shares have added about 3.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Raymond James Financial, Inc. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Raymond James Q2 Earnings Miss on Muted IBRaymond James’ second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31) adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 by a considerable margin. The bottom line, however, was up 25% from the prior-year quarter. We had projected adjusted earnings per share of $2.15.A weak investment banking performance amid heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic ambiguities hurt the Capital Markets segment’s results. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter on the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. Further, expenses increased during the quarter.Yet, higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a substantial jump in net interest income. Further, the performance of the Private Client Group was robust. Also, the acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $425 million, up 32% year over year.Revenues &amp; Costs RiseNet revenues were $2.87 billion, up 7% year over year. The top line, however, marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88 billion. Our estimate for net revenues was the same as the consensus number.Segment-wise, in the reported quarter, RJ Bank registered a surge of 174% from the prior year in net revenues. Also, the Private Client Group recorded 12% growth in net revenues. Capital Markets’ top line declined 27%, while Asset Management’s net revenues fell 8%. Others recorded revenues of $10 million against negative revenues of $18 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses rose 3% to $2.32 billion. Our estimate for non-interest expense was $2.27 billion. Also, RJF recorded a bank loan provision for credit losses of $28 million, up from $21 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Mar 31, 2023, client assets under administration were $1.22 trillion, down 3% from the end of the prior-year quarter. Financial assets under management of $194.4 billion were relatively stable.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet &amp; Capital RatiosAs of Mar 31, 2023, Raymond James reported total assets of $79.18 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. Total equity grew 1% sequentially to $9.88 billion.Book value per share was $46.67, up from $41.38 as of Mar 31, 2022.As of Mar 31, 2023, total capital ratio was 21.4% compared with 25% as of Mar 31, 2022. Tier 1 capital ratio was 20.1% compared with 23.9% as of March 2022-end.Return on common equity (annualized basis) was 17.3% at the end of the reported quarter compared with 15% a year ago.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, RJF repurchased 3.75 million shares for $350 million.OutlookThe company expects combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to decline sequentially in the fiscal third quarter of 2023 due to a decrease in third-party RJBDP fees given the lower average balances with third-party banks.Management expects the bank segments NIM in the fiscal third quarter to contract from the second quarter given the higher level of cash balances it plans to maintain during the volatile period as well as the impact from higher cost diversified funding sources.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Raymond James Financial, Inc. has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F.

Price and EPS SurpriseNordstrom, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNordstrom’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners.Management expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. We anticipate a 12.6% decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, we expect sales to decline 13% for the Nordstrom banner and 13.2% for the Nordstrom Rack segment.In order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well.

27,03d7d10d-7087-3cda-99e5-15e0418609a9,HBAN,2023-05-27,Huntington (HBAN) Rides on Balance Sheet Growth Amid Cost Woes (Revised),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huntington-hban-rides-balance-sheet-113200386.html,1685100720,STORY,"['HBAN', 'MUFG']","[Huntington Bancshares’ HBAN solid loan and deposit balances are expected to drive organic growth. Also, net interest income (NII) and margins are anticipated to rise in the near term. However, the company is witnessing higher expenses. Also, a lack of diversification in the loan portfolio and declining mortgage banking income due to higher mortgage rates are concerning.While other banks witnessed a decline in deposits in the first quarter due to regional bank failures, Huntington’s deposit balances increased during the same period, indicating strength in this funding source. Moreover, the company’s lending book has also witnessed robust growth in the past few years supported by resilient commercial and consumer loan portfolios. Going forward, a rise in deposits will help HBAN be active on the lending front and strengthen its balance sheet. In fact, for 2023, management expects average loans to grow 5-7%.Given the solid loan demand and expectations of interest rates remaining high in the near term, Huntington’s NII is expected to increase and propel top-line growth. The company projects 2023 NII (excluding Paycheck Protection Program and Purchase Accounting Accretion) growth of 6-9%.Organic growth aside, Huntington has been undertaking strategic acquisitions in a bid to expand its footprint and capabilities in a number of verticals. In June 2022, it completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, an Investment Banking firm, enhancing the complementary capabilities of the capital markets business. In May 2022, the company acquired Torana to enhance its digital capabilities and enterprise payments strategy.With credit metrics gradually improving since the last quarter of 2009, we see HBAN as a proven astute manager of its credit quality historically. In first-quarter 2023, total non-performing assets were $578 million, down from $708 million in the prior-year quarter. With decent credit quality and reserves, the company is well-positioned to manage through any economic uncertainty.As of Mar 31, 2023, cash and due from banks as well as interest-bearing deposits of $10.57 billion, was less than its long-term debt of $13.07 billion. Nonetheless, the company’s largest source of liquidity is core deposits, a source of stable and lower-cost funding. Core deposits totaled $140.4 billion as of Mar 31, and comprised 97% of total deposits. Given the decent liquidity and earnings strength, the company appears well-placed to meet its debt obligations in the long term.However, Huntington’s rising cost base limits its bottom-line growth. Non-interest expenses have been increasing over the past few years due to continued investments in key growth initiatives. The rising trend is likely to continue in the near term, with management projecting the metric to increase 1-3% in 2023.As mortgage rates are expected to remain high in the near future, origination volumes and refinancing activities are less likely to witness growth. This is expected to reduce Huntington’s mortgage banking income and fee income in the near term.The majority of Huntington’s loan portfolio (57% as of Mar 31, 2023) comprises total commercial loans, depicting a lack of diversification. This can be risky for the company amid any unfavorable developments in the economy and competitive markets.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 30.7% compared with a 30.8% decline recorded by the industry over the past six months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bank Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.

28,019337ca-2eb3-3fec-9dc9-5ce041351aaa,MGM,2023-05-27,Here's Why Leggett (LEG) is Performing Better Than Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-leggett-leg-performing-171900098.html,1685121540,STORY,"['LEG', 'SKX', 'MGM']","[Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated’s LEG shares have been outpacing the Zacks Furniture industry this year. In the year-to-date period, the stock has slipped just 1.8% compared with the industry’s 14.2% fall.This global manufacturer of a wide variety of engineered components has been benefiting from its long-term strategic plan. Also, raw material-related selling price increases and bolt-on acquisitions are added positives. Impressive liquidity is also helping it combat persistent macroeconomic pressure and reward shareholders.The overall furniture market is highly fragmented and has been grappling with supply chain disruptions and high inflation rates. LEG is also witnessing lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, soft volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation.Let’s discuss the factors influencing growth of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Strategic Long-Term Moves: Leggett remains on track with its long-term strategic plan, which was announced in November 2007. The company has completed the first two parts of its strategic plan and is now working on the third, which aims to achieve top-line growth of 6-9% annually. This long-term revenue target assumes 6% organic growth, coupled with growth from acquisitions.In 2022, net trade sales increased by 1% from 2021 despite industry-related woes. Of this growth, raw material-related selling prices added 9% and acquisitions (net of divestitures) contributed 1% to sales. Although the recent market slowdown arising from macro-market uncertainties may compel the company to carry out the plan at a slower pace, it will most definitely gain traction as the effects of the pandemic gradually phase out.Acquisitions to Boost Organic Growth: Leggett’s business depends largely on acquisitions as part of its growth strategy to supplement organic growth and expand across boundaries.In early October and mid-December 2022, the company acquired two Canadian distributors of products used for erosion control, stormwater management, and various other applications. These acquisitions became part of the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment.The company anticipates the acquisitions completed in 2022 will contribute 3% to sales growth in 2023. The company did not acquire any businesses in first-quarter 2023 and expects minimal acquisition activity in the rest of 2023.Strong Liquidity to Boost Shareholders’ Return: As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $345 million compared with $315 million at 2022-end, which is enough to meet the company’s current debt maturity of $9 million. Cash generated from operating activities was $97 million, up $58 million compared to the prior-year period. Capital expenditures were $38 million during first-quarter 2023.On May 4, 2023, the company announced that it has increased its quarterly dividend to 46 cents per share, reflecting a 4.5% increase from the year-ago period. During first quarter 2023, Leggett repurchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $34.04 and issued 0.5 million shares through employee benefit plans.Story continuesFactors Impacting MarginsMacro-Economic Woes: Consumers in the housing and related industries are increasingly concerned about rising inflation. During  first-quarter 2023, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) and 280 bps, respectively, due to lower volume, lower metal margin in the Steel Rod business and lower overhead recovery.Leggett has been witnessing supply chain disruptions, especially in chemicals, semiconductors, labor and transportation, which are constraining volume growth. During first-quarter 2023, volume was down 7%, primarily from demand softness in residential end markets.Volume was down 9% in Bedding and 15% in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products primarily due to demand softness in U.S. bedding markets and lower trade demand in Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses, as well as in Home Furniture, Flooring, and Fabric Converting.Tepid Views: Leggett anticipates second-quarter to be similar to the first quarter, mainly owing to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals and normal seasonality in some of its businesses.For 2023, Leggett expects sales in the range of $4.8–$5.2 billion. This indicates a 7% decline to 1% growth year over year. The raw material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits. Sales are likely to be down in the low single digits in Bedding Products, up high single digits in Specialized Products and down low single digits in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segments.For 2023, earnings are expected to be between $1.50 and $1.90 per share, down from 2022 levels due to lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, lower volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. The company expects an EBIT margin of 7.5-8% in 2023.Top-Ranked Stocks in the Consumer Discretionary SectorSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Trip.com Group Limited TCOM and Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

RCL is poised to benefit from improvements in booking activities, e-commerce enhancements and fleet-expansion efforts. Also, the improved pricing environment and the continued strength in onboard revenue areas have been important factor for sales improvement over the last few quarters.Shares of Royal Caribbean have surged 34.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 9.7% growth. The price performance was backed by a solid earnings surprise history. Royal Caribbean’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters. Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 and 2024 have moved up 40.6% and 18.6%, respectively, in the past 30 days.

This compares with 48% of guests reported in 2019. The company stated that every dollar of pre-cruse spending translates into approximately $0.70 of incremental spend (on board). Secular tailwinds, courtesy of shifting of consumer preferences from goods to entertainment and travel spending (24% higher than 2019 levels) added to the positives. The company emphasizes on enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing its distribution channels to boost guest repeat rates and spending.Royal Caribbean witnesses better-than-expected booking volumes in first-quarter 2023, which were much higher than the 2019 levels. As of Mar 31, 2023, North America-based sailings portrayed robust booking trends, accounting for nearly 76% of the company’s capacity. RCL registered better-than-expected load factors, owing to a rise in close-in bookings.

As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had about $5.27 billion in customer deposits.Story continuesGiven the full fleet resumption and load factors at high prices (at approximately 102%), the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods.

NCLH is likely to benefit from strong booking activities, occupancy improvement and fleet expansion efforts. This and the focus on onboard revenue generation bode well. However, inflationary pressures pose concerns.Let us discuss why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.Key CatalystsImprovements in booking activities have been aiding the company. The bookings include incorporating higher pricing and the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (FCCs). During the first quarter of 2023, the company generated solid booking volumes, courtesy of strong demand in the WAVE season. The company stated that the cumulative booked position for 2023 are higher than 2019 levels. Also, it reported strength in advance ticket sales. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s advance ticket sales balance came in at $3.4 billion, up 26% (from the previous quarter’s levels) and 60% (from 2019 levels). The company stated pricing levels to be elevated. The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods.Norwegian Cruise benefits from improvements in occupancy. In first-quarter 2023, occupancy was approximately 101.5%, exceeding the company’s expectations of approximately 100%. In the previous quarter, the company reported an occupancy of 87%. It anticipates occupancy ramp-up to complete and reach approximately 105% during the second quarter of 2023. Relaxation in COVID-related protocols is likely to add to the positives.Increased focus on onboard revenue generation bodes well. During the first quarter of 2023, gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was nearly 30% higher than 2019 levels. This upside was primarily driven by enhancements with respect to its bundled offerings. The company emphasizes on increasing quality touchpoints with guests (at the time of booking) to capture more revenues and pre-payment prior to cruise. Also, the emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and rationalization of product delivery, bodes well.Story continuesNorwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size to drive growth. It plans to introduce eight more ships through 2028. A majority of them are on order for the Norwegian Cruise Line, while the rest are for Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. For the Regent brand, it has one Explorer Class Ship to be delivered in 2023. For the Oceania Cruises brand, the company has one Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2025. For the Norwegian brand, the company has five Prima Class Ships on order, with scheduled delivery dates from 2023 through 2028. The company anticipates the additions to increase the birth count to approximately 82,000.ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past three months, shares of the company have declined 12.3% compared with the industry’s fall of 1%. The company’s operations are likely to be influenced by the downstream effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Also, volatility in inflation, rising fuel prices and rising interest rates added to the downside. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment.Norwegian Cruise has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the first quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses came in at $1,280.4 million compared with $735.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The company’s expenses in the quarter stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages and inflationary pressures. The company reported a rise in payroll, fuel and direct variable costs of fully-operating ships. Also, inflationary pressures relating to food, perishables and logistics added to the woes.

But we're now focusing on your investments. Citigroup raising Carnival to buy from a neutral and lifting its price target to $14, saying the cruise industry is seeing positive momentum, and it is not slowing down.Joining us now, we've got the analyst behind the call, Citi Leisure and Travel analyst James Hardiman. James, good to talk to you today. We talk about the call that you made here, upping your price target from 10 to 14. But specifically, you've said pandemic tailwinds to the cruise industry are greater than any macro headwinds. Talk to me about what you're seeing.JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I think that's right. While so much of the economy over the last few years was emerging from this pandemic, I mean, the cruise industry was laid up for an extended period of time. We call this the last remaining reopening story.And it really wasn't until the fall really, almost into the wintertime last year, where the final COVID restrictions were lifted. You know, I think people were not only worried about getting COVID on these cruise ships, but I think more importantly, they were worried about getting stuck, right, and all of the sort of testing requirements that went into not only getting on the ship, but getting off the ship.And so if I think about what's happened since that time, you know, and all the data that we look at in terms of both pricing and booking activity, we think that was a turning point and that things really picked up since then and carried through into this year's wave season. The wave season is the first three months of the year, where a disproportionate number of the bookings take place. And by all accounts, it's been an excellent wave season.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: James, give us a better sense of that pricing and the traffic that you just mentioned there, how that compares to 2019 levels pre-pandemic?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, it's a great question. So from a booking perspective, we're finally starting to comp favorably to 2019, where we're sort of at the higher end of historical booking levels. Pricing, we think about is more of an opportunity than anything. By our numbers, we think cruise ticket pricing specifically on board is much higher. But cruise ticket pricing is only up a couple of per cent in aggregate for the industry versus 2019. And of all of the cruise companies, Carnival is the biggest laggard here.We're starting to see that inflect positively. And we think that's a big opportunity. Effectively, this is an industry that was sitting on the sidelines for three years while everything else in consumer were driving prices higher and higher and higher. And so on a relative basis, I think a lot of consumers are going to look at cruise travel and say to themselves, you know, my dollars aren't going as far as they used to. This is a bargain for all intents and purposes.AKIKO FUJITA: And that's exactly my question, James, because I'm thinking back to 2019 pre-pandemic. This is an industry that had a lot of loyal customers, but very specific customers, right? When you think about the momentum that we're seeing right now, is this about that same group returning or are a lot of these cruise liners are companies bringing new travelers into the fold?JAMES HARDIMAN: I think it's both, I think early on in the restart. So if we were to rewind a year ago, call it maybe even a little bit more, it was all about, you know, people that were regular cruisers and that had missed a trip or two, right, and they were sort of making up for lost time.I think in the last 6 to 9 months, we've seen the new to cruise segment really come back in full force. And most of these cruise companies are now saying that the new to cruise portion of the mix is similar, in some cases better than it was in 2019, which I think speaks volumes.SEANA SMITH: James, are you seeing any signs of the consumers trading down and opting for maybe some of the cheaper options that the cruise lines are offering?JAMES HARDIMAN: It's a great question. We're not seeing that per se. I would tell you that what we are seeing, and I think this feeds into to yesterday's upgrade to a certain degree, is that the premium offerings, right, the higher end, more expensive offerings were early on doing well. We're outperforming in a meaningful way.Fast forward to today, and we're starting to see some of the more, they call it contemporary in the cruise space, but maybe a little more value-focused offerings, playing catch up. And so on a year over year basis, Carnival, the brand Carnival, not the company, but the Carnival brand based on a lot of the pricing data that we look at is the best performing brand in the industry right now, on a year over year basis. Some of that is ultimately playing catch up. But we'll take it nonethelessAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. And so as you look at the other names in the space, I mean, clearly you've given an upgrade to Carnival. You like what you see there. But are they best positioned to maintain or at least take more market share and be able to benefit from the momentum we're seeing right now?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I think the way that Carnival has the most juice for sure. And some of that is that they've got more distance to go. Long before the pandemic started, I think a lot of Carnival's brands-- and to give you an idea, the Carnival proper, right, the namesake brand is their biggest, but it's far from their only brand. They have nine different brands. Princess is another big one. Costa is another big one. Those are the three biggest brands for Carnival.I think there have been challenges for all three of those brands. There have been some missteps along the way. There's been some really bad luck along the way. But I think there's the opportunity. And so much of this upgrade, that Carnival has a newsy, newish CEO. He's been there for about a year now. I think there's a huge opportunity for Josh Weinstein to start to, you know, turn this ship around, so to speak.SEANA SMITH: James, we talk about a lot, the consumers are focused on experiences. And I know you cover Six Flags. How are regional theme parks positioned in the event of a downturn or in a time when some consumers are looking to save a little bit of money and not splurging for that vacation?JAMES HARDIMAN: It's a great question. And even coming into last year, as people started to have concerns about the macro environment, the theme park space was our sort of top industry pick because historically they have been trade down beneficiaries.I think last year, if you think about what we saw in the broader economy, the broader consumer sector. We saw a lot of those low end consumers fall out of the bottom end. But we didn't see sort of that trade down piece, right? The higher end consumers that are opting not to go to, you know, Florida or Mexico or Europe.The hope is that we begin to see that favorable offset here in 2023. But I would tell you so far. I mean, most of the industry data that we've looked at has been somewhat disappointing thus far. So, you know, when I think about the cruise industry, it's the one sector that I cover and really more broadly across consumers. Hard to say-- to say the following about a whole lot of sectors. And that's that, you know, a recession would be an improvement for the cruise space versus where they've been the last few years.And I have a high degree of confidence that 2023 is going to be better than '22, and that '24 is going to be better than '23. You can't say that about a whole lot of sectors right now.AKIKO FUJITA: James Hardiman, Citi analyst, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

36,54abba16-a607-3ccb-8dcd-f3afdc0c8ab3,MET,2023-05-27,Investors in MetLife (NYSE:MET) have seen respectable returns of 59% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-metlife-nyse-met-seen-110043544.html,1685185243,STORY,['MET'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 28% in that time. But we wouldn't complain about the gain over the last three years. After all, the stock has performed better than the market (40%) over that time, over which it gained 44%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for MetLife To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, MetLife failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 52% (annualized).Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We note that the dividend is higher than it was preciously, so that may have assisted the share price. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthMetLife is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for MetLife in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, MetLife's TSR for the last 3 years was 59%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in MetLife had a tough year, with a total loss of 21% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 1.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand MetLife better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - MetLife has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

MET recently inked a risk transfer deal with the retirement and life insurance company, Global Atlantic Financial Group, in sync with prudent risk management efforts undertaken by the former within its closed-block businesses.The insurer will reinsure U.S. retail life insurance and fixed annuity statutory reserves of roughly $19.2 billion with Global Atlantic. Out of the total reserves reinsured, $14 billion relates to U.S. retail life insurance products of MetLife, while the remaining comprises fixed annuities. The risk transfer transaction is likely to be completed in the second half of 2023.The total value of the transaction is anticipated to be around $3.25 billion for MetLife, which consists of a ceding commission of roughly $2.25 billion and freed-up capital of $1 billion. Additionally, the same is likely to be beneficial to MET’s adjusted earnings per share and will also help the insurer to achieve the adjusted return on equity target of 13% to 15%. A significant amount of capital release might have provided an impetus to MetLife to engage in the prudent deployment of capital through share buybacks. To this effect, concurrent with the risk transfer transaction disclosure, management sanctioned an increase of $1 billion in its share buyback authorization.This marks the second buyback capacity increase announcement in the month of May 2023, with the first one being the $3 billion program announcement on May 3. Therefore, the total buyback authorization outstanding currently stands at around $4 billion.The reinsurance transaction reflects MetLife’s intensified focus on minimizing enterprise risk and boosting growth-related investments. Such transactions generally aim to limit losses suffered by insurance companies, reduce exposure to substantial risks and boost capacity. Meanwhile, reinsurance contracts also offer an opportunity for MetLife to sustain its solid capital deployment record. A solid financial position substantiated by sound cash reserves and sufficient cash-generating abilities remains in place for MET. Apart from regular share buybacks, the insurer also pays out dividends to shareholders.Story continuesManagement approved a quarterly dividend hike of 4% in April 2023. The company’s dividends have witnessed a 12-year CAGR of 9%. Its dividend yield of 3.9% lies higher than the industry’s average of 2.8%.Shares of MetLife have declined 22.1% in a year, compared with the industry’s 16.6% fall.

On the other, it’s whether a stay or another cut is coming. But Fed hike or OPEC+ cut, May is turning out to be a mixed month for oil bulls despite two straight weeks of gains.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled Friday’s trade up 84 cents, or 1.2%, at $72.67 per barrel. WTI slumped 3% in the previous session, but still managed to finish up 1.6% on the week after last week’s rise of 2.2%.London-traded Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil, settled up 69 cents, or 0.9%, at $76.95. Brent finished the week up 1.8% after the prior week’s gain of 1.9%.Oil pared Friday’s gains after the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge for U.S. inflation came in hotter-than-forecast for April, indicating that the central bank will raise interest rates again in June and July versus expectations for a pause.All key metrics in the so-called Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Index rose for last month against forecast levels as the Fed keenly looked for indicators that would compel a hold on its higher-for-longer monetary policy that has already seen 10 rate hikes over 15 months.For the year to April, the PCE Index expanded at 4.4% versus forecasts for 3.9% and previous growth of 4.2%. For the month of April itself, it jumped 0.4%, as expected and versus a prior expansion of 0.1%.“Core” PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, gained 4.7% on an annualized basis versus both the projected and previous rate of 4.6%. On a monthly basis, it rose 0.4% against the forecast and prior rate of 0.3%.“Inflation is a problem and the consumer remains red hot,” economist Adam Button said on the ForexLive forum. “The Fed is going to hike again and now the odds are 58-42% for June and July is 100% with a slight chance of another hike. At some point the Fed will have to pause and evaluate but we're lapping some very high energy numbers now and it's not enough to get inflation to a 3-handle. At minimum, the Fed needs to start seeing some monthly numbers at +0.3% or lower.”Story continuesEarlier, oil rallied as Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who is also the nation’s de facto oil minister, walked back his comments from Thursday that suggested that the OPEC+ alliance will not cut output again at its meeting on June 4.OPEC+, an alliance of 13 Saudi-led nations in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 other oil producers steered by Russia, has had limited success over the past two months in trying to push crude prices up with production cuts.In April, OPEC+ announced a 1.7 million-barrel-per-day cut, on top of a prior undertaking to shed 2M barrels daily.After the April cut was announced, crude prices only went up for two weeks, before turning lower over four weeks, erasing some 15%. The earlier reduction fared worse, resulting in just a few days of gains before prices tumbled to 15-month lows in March.Novak, potentially sensing that another cut won’t do much for the group, said on Thursday he was still waiting “for an assessment of the situation in the market.""""But I don't think that there will be any new steps, because just a month ago certain decisions were made regarding the voluntary reduction of oil production by some countries due to the fact that we saw the slow pace of global economic recovery,"" he was quoted as saying by the Izvestia newspaper in a report reproduced by Reuters.On Friday though, Novak suggested that Bloomberg had taken his comments out of context, though he did not dispute Reuters reporting.“We do not agree with the fact that Bloomberg misrepresented information, based on an incomplete quotation, declaring Russia's disagreement with the possibility of making decisions at a future meeting,” the deputy premier said. “Russia will engage in discussions with partners to determine what is best for the market while adhering to all previous decisions.”Related ArticlesOil in 2nd weekly gain amid inflation bruise, ‘misquote’ on Russia  Oil prices rise as US closes in on debt dealGold in 3rd weekly loss; Analysts say upside cracked, not entirely broken]"

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Tethys Petroleum's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Tethys Petroleum How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tethys Petroleum is:21% = US$7.4m ÷ US$35m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each CA$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made CA$0.21 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Tethys Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 21% ROEAt first glance, Tethys Petroleum seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 25% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Tethys Petroleum's significant 40% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Tethys Petroleum's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 40% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Tethys Petroleum's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Tethys Petroleum Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Tethys Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 18%, meaning that it has the remaining 82% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Tethys Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Tethys Petroleum's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Earnings of $1.56 per share beat the consensus estimate by 13%. Earnings per share increased 12.2% year over year.Total revenues of $3.4 billion surpassed the consensus estimate by 2.3%. The top line increased 1% year over year. The increase in the top line resulted from a 5.2% rise in revenues from organic growth, partially offset by a negative impact of 3.2% due to foreign currency translations and a 1% fall in acquisition revenues, net of disposition revenues.Driven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, Omnicom has outperformed its industry in the past year, growing 18.8% against its industry’s13.4% decrease.Omnicom Group Inc.

The survey area has been selected based on previous geological investigations of fertile/lithium enriched parent granites in the area and the predicted source location of the spodumene bearing pegmatite boulders.The samples will be sent in batches each week to Activation Laboratories (Actlabs) in Thunder Bay, ON and analysis will be finalized at Activation Laboratories in Ancaster, ON. The samples will be analyzed by Actlab's biogeochemistry 2D-ICPMS method for vegetation ash to report concentrations of 59 elements. The company will use the biogeochemistry data to assess lithium concentrations as well as pathfinder elements to define exploration targets for follow-up prospecting, bedrock trenching, and drill hole targeting.Project SummaryThe Property has since been expanded to encompass approximately 20,000 hectares located in a prolific lithium exploration area where several junior mining companies including Rock Tech Lithium, which has an established Lithium resource and advanced to a Pre-Feasiblity Study. The Trix Property road is accessible and is located 4km south of Rock Tech Lithium's MNW lithium deposit.Historically, Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) geologists discovered a 10-tonne spodumene pegmatite boulder along with small spodumene-bearing fragments located in a creek on the Trix Lithium Property. Glacial geologists determined the potential source direction and displacement as 2 kilometers from the boulder. Due diligence sampling was undertaken in the claim region in the fall of 2022 and multiple assays returned over 1.0% lithium oxide (Li2O) with a high of  5.48% Li2O. The Company intends to carry out extensive surface sampling and other exploration work to find the source of the high-grade lithium occurrences.Story continuesThe spodumene-bearing pegmatites of the Georgia Lake area were first discovered in 1955. Subsequent to the initial discovery, numerous claims were staked and additional lithium deposits were subsequently located.  While some work was conducted in ensuing decades, the majority of historical exploration was completed in 1955-1958, however, recent advancements in the Electric Vehicle market has turned the Georgia Lake area into a very active exploration district.Alex Pleson, P.Geo., Geological Consultant of the Company, and a ""Qualified Person"" for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.Corporate UpdateThe Company is pleased to announce a non-brokered private placement of 2,000,000 flow-through (FT) shares for gross procesds of $ 1,250,000 by issuing:  (i) Quebec FT shares at price of $0.64 cents per share; (ii)  National FT shares  at a price of $ 0.61 cents per share.In connection to the above noted non-brokered private placement, a finder's fees may be paid to eligible finders in accordance with the policies of the CSE. Closing of the proposed private placement is subject to obtaining all required approvals, including from the CSE and any other regulatory approval. The securities will be subject to a four-month hold period plus one day under applicable securities laws.Lastly, FE Battery Metals intends to grant incentive stock options and RSU's ( restricted share units)  to certain directors and consultants of the Company in accordance with its stock option plan and RSU plan.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected between $1.60 and $1.61 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8.17 billion, indicating an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.61 per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 64.3%.Salesforce’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.6%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Salesforce Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSalesforce Inc. price-eps-surprise | Salesforce Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderSalesforce’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.The company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.Salesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing &amp; Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.Story continuesHowever, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.However, the ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, is likely to have boosted Salesforce’s profitability in the first quarter. Restructuring initiatives had benefited the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings by 9 cents per share.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Salesforce this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

The acquisition of Nexus Controls (April 2023), which allows the creation of a single and full-service controls business line for further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform, should bolster the segment’s growth. The acquisition is aligned with General Electric’s commitment to invest in leading controls technology and expertise to enhance customer experience.The GE Renewable Energy segment is also showing signs of progress due to higher equipment demand at Grid and Onshore Wind in North America.

Despite a volatile demand situation in 2023, strong booking levels have driven the stock higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRecord levels of booking due to strong MRO and aftermarket activity are driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growth. The first-quarter bookings of $1.06 billion marked the company’s fifth consecutive quarter of above $1 billion bookings.Following strong first-quarter performance, Flowserve has raised its 2023 guidance. The company expects revenues to increase 10-12% year over year in 2023 compared with 9-11% rise anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be between $1.65 and $1.85 compared with $1.50-$1.75 anticipated earlier.Flowserve aims to expand its product offerings by acquiring assets. In February 2023, the company inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen Flowserve’s valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets. The deal is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2023-end. Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division segment.Flowserve’s consistent measures to reward its shareholders through dividend payments also might have boosted the stock. In 2022, the company’s dividend payments totaled $104.5 million. In the first quarter of 2023, it paid dividends of $26.2 million.Will the Uptrend in Shares Last?Flowserve’s solid booking levels highlight the strength across its end markets. This should help the company’s shares hold up well in the near term. The company’s Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize (3D) strategy also supports its strong booking levels.

Coming into Nvidia’s May 26th quarterly numbers, many analysts saw some upside to consensus estimates, given the company’s AI leverage. But the stock had already doubled this year before the Wednesday release on those AI hopes.It is humbling to acknowledge that I thought the stock was ‘priced for perfection’ and was skeptical that Nvidia could do anything in the quarterly numbers that could satisfy those lofty expectations. Keep in mind that we fall in the Nvidia ‘fan club,’ having held the stock in the Zacks Focus List portfolio since May 2019.The stock’s performance since the quarterly release is in a class of its own, and for good reasons. In the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, Nvidia raised Q2 revenue guidance by more than +50% on the back of robust data-center demand reflecting momentum in generative AI and large language models. Importantly, Nvidia indicated a high degree of visibility in these demand trends over the coming quarters.There are legitimate questions as to how sustainable this growth trajectory will prove to be and whether Nvidia will be able to protect its first-mover advantage as the competitive landscape heats up over time.We have all glimpsed the potential of generative AI by playing around with ChatGPT and Google Bard, allowing us to envision this technology’s ability to enhance efficiencies. But it is reasonable to be skeptical of both the trillions of dollars in TAMs that the AI revolution will unleash or the emerging talk of an ‘AI bubble.’Nvidia is hardly alone in riding the AI wave, with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL already duking it out for primacy. Alphabet’s earlier AI efforts didn’t impress the market much, and many had started thinking that Microsoft may be able to leverage AI to open up Alphabet’s hold on the search market. But Alphabet appears to have found its mojo back, as the stock’s recent performance shows.Story continuesThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe earnings outlook for the ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ that includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta META, in addition to Microsoft and Alphabet, has steadily improved lately. Total Q1 earnings for the group were essentially flat (down -0.4%) on +4.3% higher revenues.The growth outlook starts improving from the current period (2023 Q2) onwards, with earnings expected to be up +8.9% on +4.9% higher revenues.The chart below shows the group’s earnings picture on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the group’s earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 26th, we now have Q1 earnings from 486 S&amp;P 500 members, or 97.2% of the index’s total membership.

If you want to skip our analysis of how we ranked these games and want to dive directly into the best games ever, head to the 10 Best PC Games Of All Time.The gaming industry has been a billion-dollar business for decades now, providing entertainment for young and adults alike. Video games have continued to evolve over time and become more lifelike. That has also made the industry more complex, with developers injecting millions of dollars into their development. Gone are the days of pixelated screens.The industry remains large and continues to grow. Although kids spend a higher daily average time on gaming, the hobby is gaining traction among adults as well. The first-generation gamers of the Nintendo, Atari and computer era still want to play. According to Investopedia, there are over 2 billion gamers today, constituting little over a quarter of the world’s population. The industry generated $155 billion in revenue in 2020, which is expected to jump to more than $260 billion by 2025.The major players in the video gaming industry are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Nintendo. With its initial focus on PC gaming on its Windows platform, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has, in recent years, also come up with its console, the Xbox, that competes with Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation.At the same time, the mobile gaming industry has been picking up pace as well, with tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) venturing into this lucrative market. In 2019, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its video game subscription service, Apple Arcade, worth $500 million that gave gamers access to a variety of games without advertisements.Despite the rise of console and mobile gaming over the last two decades, the PC gaming industry continues to remain strong due to PC’s feature allowing a wide range of components to be upgraded, such as installing multiple processors, graphic cards, and additional memory. Story continuesOn the other hand, the consoles generally come with built-in parts that, in most cases, cannot be modified. In 2022, there were 1.1 billion active PC gamers, as opposed to 611 million console users. Revenue from the PC industry was estimated at $37 billion in 2020 by Statista, and a research by Vantage indicates the market will grow by 1.20% by 2030.Europe holds the largest market share of 32.50% in the PC gaming market. This could be attributed to the presence of key game development companies on the continent. Another significant pattern is the high purchasing power in the region. As far as segmentation goes, the PC gaming market is divided into a diverse set of genres which includes, but is not limited to, Action, Sport, Role Playing, Racing and Strategy.The first computer game in history was Spacewar, launched in 1962 by Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It involved two players controlling a spaceship each, shooting at each other, and turning and accelerating their spaceships to avoid getting hit. The game was an instant hit worldwide and became the basis of the first ever gaming tournament. In the 1980s, the release of Ultima and Zork sparked widespread popularity of the PC gaming industry which has since then not looked back.Advancement in technology such as in graphic cards, audio cards, internet, emergence of role-playing and multiplayer games has helped the industry grow exponentially. To date, the PC remains the preferred gaming platform for both developers and gamers. A game studio survey held by The Verge in 2019 showed that 56% of the developers released their games for PC, compared to Mobile 39%, PlayStation 11%, and Xbox 9%. The future looks encouraging as well, with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) set to enhance the gaming experience for users.Several thousands of PC games have been developed over the last half a century or so. There are new ones being released each day as well. With varying levels of popularity, features, and gameplay, it makes it a challenge to identify the top picks in the PC gaming industry. Here are the 30 Best PC Games of All Time based on our research.30 Best PC Games Of All TimeCopyright: patrikslezak - 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyThe consensus method has been used to rank the Best 30 PC Games of All Time in this article.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo - REUTERS/Dado RuvicMicrosoft has accused Britain’s competition authority of “irrationally” blocking its £55bn takeover of the Call of Duty video game maker Activision.In its appeal to the Competition and Market Authority’s (CMA) decision, Microsoft, which makes the Xbox games console, accused the regulator of making “fundamental errors”.Microsoft said in its filing with the Competition Appeal Tribunal that the CMA had not taken “proper account of three long term commercial agreements which [Microsoft] had entered into” with cloud gaming companies. Microsoft has announced several decade-long deals with gaming companies to ensure their access to Call of Duty.The CMA blocked Microsoft’s takeover of Activision in April, arguing it would stifle competition in the growing market for streaming video games.Following the decision, Microsoft president Brad Smith hit out at the regulator and claimed the move sent a “clear message” that the EU was a more attractive place to start a business than Britain.Meanwhile Activision, which also makes the mobile game Candy Crush, accused the UK of being “closed for business”.Since the CMA halted the merger, European officials have given the deal the green light. Sources in Brussels dismissed British concerns about the so-called cloud gaming market, arguing it accounts for a tiny fraction of the video games sector.FILE - Microsoft President Brad Smith addresses a media conference regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the future of gaming in Brussels, on Feb. 21, 2023. The European Union on Monday approved Microsoftâs $69 billion purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard, deciding the deal wonât stifle competition for popular console titles like Call of Duty and accepting the U.S. tech companyâs remedies to boost competition in cloud gaming. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) - Virginia Mayo/APThe call by regulators to block the deal has also sparked pushback from politicians. Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, said he felt regulators needed to “understand their wider responsibilities for economic growth” after the deal was blocked.It comes amid fears that tech businesses are turning away from the UK despite government efforts to unleash a new “Silicon Valley” in Britain. Revolut, the fintech giant, has said it would seek to go public in the US after struggling to secure a UK banking licence, while chip designer Arm has snubbed the City to float in New York.Writing in the Telegraph last week, Marcus Bokkerink, chairman of the CMA, said he “fundamentally disagreed” with claims it was discouraging investment by blocking the takeover.Story continuesHe said: “If we allow entrenched market power to grow, we all suffer.”In a filing with the tribunal, Microsoft said the CMA’s decision was wrong because it had failed to take into account a series of long-term commitments the tech giant had made with rival console makers to maintain their access to Call of Duty.Microsoft’s takeover of Activision had been opposed by Sony, which makes the Playstation, over fears it would cut it off from access to Call of Duty. Microsoft argued the CMA had not taken on board evidence that it had no incentive to block its rival and that it had been “disproportionate” in its decision to ban the takeover.A CMA spokesman said: “We prohibited this deal as we had concerns that it would reduce innovation and choice in the cloud gaming market in the UK. We will defend our position in court.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism. Try The Telegraph free for 1 month, then enjoy 1 year for just $9 with our US-exclusive offer.]"

ISetting out five grounds for appeal in total, it also said it would challenge the CMA's understanding of the cloud gaming market and the impact of the deal.Rima Alaily, Microsoft Corporate Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, said the CMA's decision was ""flawed for multiple reasons, including its overestimation of the role of cloud streaming in the gaming market and our position in it, as well as its unwillingness to consider solutions that received overwhelming industry and public support"".""We are confident in the strength of our appeal and the binding commitments we have made to increase competition and choice for players today and in the future.""Appeals against CMA rulings are heard by the Competition Appeals Tribunal, which makes a judgment on the merits of the decision, and it is not an opportunity for Microsoft to submit new remedies.Story continuesThe EU's competition authorities approved the deal earlier this month after they accepted remedies put forward by Microsoft that were broadly comparable to those it proposed in the UK.Microsoft has also appealed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's action seeking to block the deal on the grounds that, the agency said, it would suppress competition.The CMA reiterated its position on Friday, with a spokesperson saying: ""We prohibited this deal as we had concerns that it would reduce innovation and choice in the cloud gaming market in the UK. We will defend our position in court."" (Reporting by Sam Tobin; additional reporting by Paul Sandle, editing by Louise Heavens, Kirsten Donovan)]"

67,029a3064-ae18-314d-b506-3eb956e527e9,SYY,2023-05-27,Should You Investigate Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) At US$70.72?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-sysco-corporation-nyse-syy-120031292.html,1685188831,STORY,['SYY'],"[Let's talk about the popular Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$78.71 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$70.51. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Sysco's current trading price of US$70.72 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Sysco What's The Opportunity In Sysco?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Sysco’s ratio of 23.17x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 19.05x, which means if you buy Sysco today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe Sysco should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Sysco’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Sysco?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 73% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sysco. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SYY’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SYY? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SYY, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 4.63% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.12% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Philip Morris as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Philip Morris is projected to report earnings of $1.46 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 1.35%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.72 billion, up 11.32% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.20 per share and revenue of $35.18 billion, which would represent changes of +3.68% and +10.77%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Philip Morris should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

GSBD need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Goldman Sachs shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Goldman Sachs is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - SBIC &amp; Commercial Industry that ranks in the Top 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 55 cents per share to 53 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Goldman Sachs right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Shares have lost about 0.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Mattel due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Mattel Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesMattel reported decent first-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line declined on a year-over-year basis.Earnings &amp; Revenues DiscussionIn the quarter under review, the company reported a loss per share of 24 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 8 cents.Net sales during the quarter amounted to $814.6 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $746 million. The top line declined 22% year over year. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, sales declined 21% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.In the North America segment, gross billings fell 27% (as reported and at cc) year over year. Gross billings in the International segment declined 16% (on a reported basis) and 14% (cc) year over year. The segment was affected by the dismal performance of Infant, Toddler and Preschool (including Fisher-Price), Dolls (including Barbie) and Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other, partially offset by growth in Vehicles (including Hot Wheels).Net sales in the North America segment declined 27% year over year on a reported basis and at cc. Net Sales in the International segment declined 15% (reported) and 13% at cc year over year.Brand-Wise Worldwide SalesMattel, through its subsidiaries, sells a broad range of toys. These items are grouped under different brands — Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, Thomas &amp; Friends and Other.Worldwide gross billings by Mattel Power Brands fell 22% (on a reported basis) and 21% (at cc) year over year to $911.3 million. The Barbie brand witnessed a decline of 41% (on a reported basis) and 40% (at cc) year over year.Gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 1% (on a reported basis) and 2% (at cc) year over year. Gross billings at the Fisher-Price were down 27% (on a reported basis) and 26% (at cc) year over year. Gross billings at Other declined 20% (on a reported basis) and 19% (at cc) year over year.Story continuesOperating ResultsDuring the first quarter, adjusted gross margin contracted 660 basis points year over year to 40%. The downside was mainly caused by inventory management efforts, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expense, cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. However, this was partially negated by pricing and savings from the Optimizing for Growth program.During the quarter under discussion, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses increased $15 million year over year to $336 million. The upside was backed by market-related pay increases, partially offset by savings from the Optimizing for Growth program.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $461.7 million compared with $761.2 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Total inventories at the end of first quarter came in at $961 million compared with $969.2 million reported in the prior year quarter.The company’s long-term debt (as of Mar 31, 2023) was $2,326.7 million compared with $2,325.6 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Shareholders’ equity was $1,937.7 million.OutlookFor 2023, the company anticipates flat net sales in comparison to 2022 at cc. Adjusted gross margin is expected at nearly 47% compared to 45.9% reported in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $900-$950 million compared with $968 million reported in the prior year.Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $175-$200 million compared with $187 million reported in 2022. The company anticipates 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.10-$1.20, down from $1.25 reported in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 11.46% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Mattel has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Mattel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Schlumberger (SLB) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.14 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Schlumberger, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is SLB a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.01.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Schlumberger.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

76,3839cf35-a8f3-3cf6-810c-eae77836a087,SLB,2023-05-27,7 Overvalued Energy Stocks to Sell Before June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-overvalued-energy-stocks-sell-233205479.html,1684798325,STORY,"['HES', 'OXY', 'CVX', 'RIG', 'COP', 'SLB']","[It may be time to sell some of the top energy stocks, especially as they become overvalued. Sure, according to the International Energy Agency, rising post-Covid demand from China, coupled with tight supply, suggests that a crude oil rebound is possible later this year. However, U.S.-driven factors such as debt ceiling uncertainty and continued interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve may outweigh this, possibly pushing Light Sweet Crude prices (now in the low-$70s per barrel) to even lower prices. Having said that, it’s not as if all energy stocks are in for a big drop, if oil prices tumble again.Conversely, it’s not as if all names in this space have big room to run, if oil has yet another rebound. With these seven energy stocks to sell now, risk/return is not in your favor. Each one is relatively overvalued, with company-specific issues that further bolster their respective bear cases.COPConocoPhillips$103.73CVXChevron$152.44HESHess$133.08INTWorld Fuel Services$23.49OXYOccidental Petroleum$59.04RIGTransocean$6.33SLBSchlumberger$46.00InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsConocoPhillips (COP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comOn the surface, it may sound odd to consider ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) an overvalued stock. Shares in this oil and gas giant trade for 8.2 times trailing twelve-month earnings. However, keep in mind that energy prices are lower than they were for most of 2022. With this, it’s likely better to use forward valuation when it comes to determining whether COP stock is overvalued or undervalued. Based on sell-side forecasts, COP trades for 10.4 times forward earnings. Yes, compared to most stocks, this sounds like a low valuation.But when you compare ConocoPhillips to peers, this valuation may make COP one of the overvalued energy stocks. Alongside this, as Mizuho’s Nitin Kumar argued back in April, it may prove difficult for the company to live up to its 10-year outlook. The analyst even added there are more attractive opportunities out there among large energy stocks.Story continuesChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is held by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio of publicly-traded stocks.Yet with the “Oracle of Omaha” paring down Berkshire’s CVX stock position by 20% last quarter, the integrated oil and gas giant’s shares may be losing this Buffett seal of approval. The answer to this question is somewhat unclear. The legendary investor hasn’t made any public statements signaling why Berkshire is reducing its stake. Then again, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, it makes sense why Buffett is making an exit. Mainly, because CVX’s cash flow generation does not justify its current valuation (8.3 times TTM earnings). On purely valuation grounds, you may want to consider Chevron as one of the energy stocks to sell now.Hess (HES)Hess (HES) logo on a phone screenSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comWhile it’s possible I’m splitting hairs about the valuations of COP and CVX, it’s clear that oil and gas exploration and production company Hess (NYSE:HES) sports a rich multiple for an energy stock. HES stock currently trades for nearly 20 times TTM earnings. Based on 2023 earnings forecasts, Hess appears even more pricey, with a forward multiple of 28.7. Yes, there is a reason why HES has become one of the more overvalued energy stocks. As InvestorPlace’s Faisal Humayun pointed out in April, there is big potential with the company’s Guyana exploration projects.In the coming years, the development of these assets could result in massive profitability growth. Even so, with this potential upside largely priced in, shares may have little room to run from here. Likewise, if crude oil prices fall again, revisions to future earnings forecasts may push HES to much lower prices.World Fuel Services (INT)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comBased in Miami, Florida, World Fuel Services (NYSE:INT) is a marketer/wholesaler of aviation, marine, and ground transportation fuel. Analysts expect INT’s earnings to grow at a steady clip between this year and 2025. Two years from now, the company could earn $3.01 per share. Not too shabby, given the current INT stock price ($23.50 per share). Then again, maybe not. There is likely a high level of uncertainty behind future earnings forecasts for World Fuel Services.The company has a history of growth via acquisitions. Increasing earnings by 65% from 2022 may hinge too heavily on more successful dealmaking. The post-Covid boom times for aviation could also come to an end if the economic slowdown worsens. This too could weigh on INT’s future results.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett may be bailing on Chevron, but it’s a different story with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Berkshire continues to buy more shares in the E&amp;P company. Buffett’s firm now owns nearly 25% of it.However, at just under $60 per share, it’s questionable whether OXY stock is a bargain. Shares now trade at the higher end, valuation-wise, among E&amp;P stocks, with forward earnings multiple of 12. Occidental Petroleum’s latest quarterly results also fell short of expectations.The “Buffett factor” may be helping to keep OXY elevated, but it’s questionable how much longer this can continue. As InvestorPlace’s Joel Baglole argued earlier this month, as Buffett is not interested in buying the company outright, outside of an unforeseen spike in crude oil prices back to 2022 highs, it’s easy to see the energy stocks bubble that has emerged with OXY deflating from here.Transocean (RIG)An image of an offshore oil rigSource: Arild Lilleboe / Shutterstock.comTransocean (NYSE:RIG) traded below $1 per share during 2020, as the pandemic-driven collapse in oil prices dried up demand for the contract drilling firm’s services. Since oil’s epic comeback in 2021, however, RIG stock has rallied by more than six-fold. Yet while the oil and gas landscape has improved tremendously, it’s not as if this company has already pulled off a big recovery, in terms of its operating performance.Transocean reported net losses last year and is expected to remain in the red for 2023. Even as analyst forecasts call for the company to report positive earnings in 2024 and 2025, an additional drop in energy prices may mean results fall short of current expectations. All of this points to RIG being one of the energy stocks to avoid. Any bit of disappointment could send it sinking back to penny stock territory (under $5 per share).Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comUnlike Transocean, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is an oil services company that has been consistently profitable recently. Yet while this stock may have less uncertainty than turnaround play RIG, it’s possible that investors have pushed SLB to too high of a valuation.SLB stock today trades for 16.8 times TTM earnings, and 15.1 times forward earnings. Admittedly, SLB has historically traded for between 12 and 20 times earnings, during times of steady profitability. Still, shares could slip down to the lower end of this valuation range, if bullishness for the stock cools from here.Something that could dampen enthusiasm may be the prospect of stagnant oil prices. As InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer argued earlier this month, this could impact Schlumberger’s growth prospects. In turn, resulting in a de-rating for shares. Although downside risk may not be very high, consider SLB one of the energy stocks to sell now.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

77,019337ca-2eb3-3fec-9dc9-5ce041351aaa,LEG,2023-05-27,Here's Why Leggett (LEG) is Performing Better Than Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-leggett-leg-performing-171900098.html,1685121540,STORY,"['LEG', 'SKX', 'MGM']","[Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated’s LEG shares have been outpacing the Zacks Furniture industry this year. In the year-to-date period, the stock has slipped just 1.8% compared with the industry’s 14.2% fall.This global manufacturer of a wide variety of engineered components has been benefiting from its long-term strategic plan. Also, raw material-related selling price increases and bolt-on acquisitions are added positives. Impressive liquidity is also helping it combat persistent macroeconomic pressure and reward shareholders.The overall furniture market is highly fragmented and has been grappling with supply chain disruptions and high inflation rates. LEG is also witnessing lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, soft volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation.Let’s discuss the factors influencing growth of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Strategic Long-Term Moves: Leggett remains on track with its long-term strategic plan, which was announced in November 2007. The company has completed the first two parts of its strategic plan and is now working on the third, which aims to achieve top-line growth of 6-9% annually. This long-term revenue target assumes 6% organic growth, coupled with growth from acquisitions.In 2022, net trade sales increased by 1% from 2021 despite industry-related woes. Of this growth, raw material-related selling prices added 9% and acquisitions (net of divestitures) contributed 1% to sales. Although the recent market slowdown arising from macro-market uncertainties may compel the company to carry out the plan at a slower pace, it will most definitely gain traction as the effects of the pandemic gradually phase out.Acquisitions to Boost Organic Growth: Leggett’s business depends largely on acquisitions as part of its growth strategy to supplement organic growth and expand across boundaries.In early October and mid-December 2022, the company acquired two Canadian distributors of products used for erosion control, stormwater management, and various other applications. These acquisitions became part of the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment.The company anticipates the acquisitions completed in 2022 will contribute 3% to sales growth in 2023. The company did not acquire any businesses in first-quarter 2023 and expects minimal acquisition activity in the rest of 2023.Strong Liquidity to Boost Shareholders’ Return: As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $345 million compared with $315 million at 2022-end, which is enough to meet the company’s current debt maturity of $9 million. Cash generated from operating activities was $97 million, up $58 million compared to the prior-year period. Capital expenditures were $38 million during first-quarter 2023.On May 4, 2023, the company announced that it has increased its quarterly dividend to 46 cents per share, reflecting a 4.5% increase from the year-ago period. During first quarter 2023, Leggett repurchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $34.04 and issued 0.5 million shares through employee benefit plans.Story continuesFactors Impacting MarginsMacro-Economic Woes: Consumers in the housing and related industries are increasingly concerned about rising inflation. During  first-quarter 2023, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) and 280 bps, respectively, due to lower volume, lower metal margin in the Steel Rod business and lower overhead recovery.Leggett has been witnessing supply chain disruptions, especially in chemicals, semiconductors, labor and transportation, which are constraining volume growth. During first-quarter 2023, volume was down 7%, primarily from demand softness in residential end markets.Volume was down 9% in Bedding and 15% in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products primarily due to demand softness in U.S. bedding markets and lower trade demand in Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses, as well as in Home Furniture, Flooring, and Fabric Converting.Tepid Views: Leggett anticipates second-quarter to be similar to the first quarter, mainly owing to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals and normal seasonality in some of its businesses.For 2023, Leggett expects sales in the range of $4.8–$5.2 billion. This indicates a 7% decline to 1% growth year over year. The raw material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits. Sales are likely to be down in the low single digits in Bedding Products, up high single digits in Specialized Products and down low single digits in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segments.For 2023, earnings are expected to be between $1.50 and $1.90 per share, down from 2022 levels due to lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, lower volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. The company expects an EBIT margin of 7.5-8% in 2023.Top-Ranked Stocks in the Consumer Discretionary SectorSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Trip.com Group Limited TCOM and Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

78,08fa7c57-264e-36d4-b093-4fdf25bed044,AIG,2023-05-27,MetLife (MET) Unveils Reinsurance Deal With Global Atlantic,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metlife-met-unveils-reinsurance-deal-153000993.html,1685115000,STORY,"['MET', 'AIG', 'AIZ', 'UVE']","[MetLife, Inc. MET recently inked a risk transfer deal with the retirement and life insurance company, Global Atlantic Financial Group, in sync with prudent risk management efforts undertaken by the former within its closed-block businesses.The insurer will reinsure U.S. retail life insurance and fixed annuity statutory reserves of roughly $19.2 billion with Global Atlantic. Out of the total reserves reinsured, $14 billion relates to U.S. retail life insurance products of MetLife, while the remaining comprises fixed annuities. The risk transfer transaction is likely to be completed in the second half of 2023.The total value of the transaction is anticipated to be around $3.25 billion for MetLife, which consists of a ceding commission of roughly $2.25 billion and freed-up capital of $1 billion. Additionally, the same is likely to be beneficial to MET’s adjusted earnings per share and will also help the insurer to achieve the adjusted return on equity target of 13% to 15%. A significant amount of capital release might have provided an impetus to MetLife to engage in the prudent deployment of capital through share buybacks. To this effect, concurrent with the risk transfer transaction disclosure, management sanctioned an increase of $1 billion in its share buyback authorization.This marks the second buyback capacity increase announcement in the month of May 2023, with the first one being the $3 billion program announcement on May 3. Therefore, the total buyback authorization outstanding currently stands at around $4 billion.The reinsurance transaction reflects MetLife’s intensified focus on minimizing enterprise risk and boosting growth-related investments. Such transactions generally aim to limit losses suffered by insurance companies, reduce exposure to substantial risks and boost capacity. Meanwhile, reinsurance contracts also offer an opportunity for MetLife to sustain its solid capital deployment record. A solid financial position substantiated by sound cash reserves and sufficient cash-generating abilities remains in place for MET. Apart from regular share buybacks, the insurer also pays out dividends to shareholders.Story continuesManagement approved a quarterly dividend hike of 4% in April 2023. The company’s dividends have witnessed a 12-year CAGR of 9%. Its dividend yield of 3.9% lies higher than the industry’s average of 2.8%.Shares of MetLife have declined 22.1% in a year, compared with the industry’s 16.6% fall.

GMED is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its international business and the pending merger with NuVasive. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results generate investors’ optimism. However, mounting expenses and a competitive landscape do not bode well for Globus Medical.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 19.7% compared to the 0.1% rise of the industry and a 2.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $5.36 billion. Globus Medical projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 12.7% compared with 13.8% of the industry. GMED’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 2.76%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Results: Globus Medical ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company delivered its highest quarterly revenues with a 21% year-over-year increase at the constant currency rate (CER). Within the United States, the Spine business witnessed notable gains across its product portfolio in expandables, biologics, MIS screws, 3D printed implants and cervical offerings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe robust performance of Enabling Technologies continued to be driven by ongoing robotic and imaging system sales. The rapid market interest and customer demand have positioned Excelsius3D, the company’s latest addition to the Excelsius Ecosystem, as a major growth driver in 2023.NuVasive Deal a Strategic One: On the first-quarter earnings call, the company provided an update regarding the pending merger with NuVasive. More than 99% of Globus Medical and NuVasive Class A shareholders have voted in support of the merger deal.Post regulatory approvals and the completion of the transaction, Globus Medical expects to deliver above 20% non-GAAP EPS accretion by the completion of the first full year following deal closure.Story continuesInternational Business Holds Potential: In the first quarter, Globus Medical’s international revenues grew 24.7% as reported and 31.5% at CER. The growth was led by international spinal implant businesses mainly in Australia, Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.Excluding Japan, the company delivered 30% CER growth in the spinal implant business. Double-digit growth was registered in most markets, with strong growth in key markets.DownsidesEscalating Expenses: In the first quarter, SG&amp;A expenses were up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses, primarily driven by sales compensation, as well as higher meetings, travel and training expenses.

In order to skip our detailed ranking and jump directly to the top shows on Hulu currently, go to 10 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 2023.Over the last few decades, television (TV) has changed from being a luxury to a standard feature in households. In 2022, the total global revenue attributed to the television industry amounted to $93.76 billion. While TV remains a key feature in our daily lives, rapid technological changes are taking place in the industry as well with multiple new technologies capturing the market, specifically in the digital space. Cable TV is experiencing stagnation, and the subscription-based, video-on-demand model is growing in popularity.Subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) is a model in which users pay a monthly or annual fee in exchange for receiving service streaming access for that time to an online library of movies, TV shows, and other content. Projections on Statista indicate that the number of subscription video-on-demand model subscribers will rise above 1.6 billion in 2027. It stood at 1.2 billion in 2021. SVOD revenue in the United States is likely to cross $95 billion in 2023, whereas it is estimated to reach around $160 billion worldwide in the same year. This revenue is expected to further grow globally at an annual rate of 9.71%, which is projected to raise the market volume to $230 billion by 2027.The SVOD industry continues to remain competitive. Major players in the market include Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, YouTube Premium, Hotstar, and HBO to name a few.The focus of this article is on the 25 best TV shows on Hulu in 2023. Hulu, which was launched in October 2007, is an American subscription-based streaming service. It is owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) holding a minority stake through NBCUniversal. It started off as a joint venture initially between New Corporation and NBC Universal, and later The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). That helped the platform gain access to television series of all these broadcasting companies. Hulu’s subscription service started in 2010 with the launch of Hulu Plus. It featured un-delayed access to television series of different partner companies. Story continuesHulu currently has over 48 million subscribers who have access to Hulu’s library, offering them to watch a wide range of movies and television series produced by Hulu’s original programming, as well as companies such as 20th Century Studios, ABC, and Disney Television Studios (NYSE:DIS). In 2016, Hulu announced to devote itself entirely to the subscription model and discontinue its on-demand video service by syndicating it to Yahoo! Screen. In 2017, Hulu inaugurated an over-the-top live TV service.2023 has been a promising year for Hulu in terms of numbers and recognition. In the first quarter of the fiscal year, the company had an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $92.32. It was nominated for 10 awards at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards, winning three.

88,de41b780-e172-3f6a-826e-3be57ba4af32,PSX,2023-05-27,3 Stocks Paul Tudor Jones Predicts Could Skyrocket by Year-End,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-paul-tudor-jones-214708860.html,1684792028,STORY,"['PSX', 'VMW', 'CPT']","[Whenever a billionaire hedge fund manager speaks, people listen, which is why investors may want to tune into Paul Tudor Jones stock picks. According to a recent CNBC article, the Wall Street living legend believes the Federal Reserve finished raising interest rates. Moving forward, the equities market could grind higher this year. To be sure, the hedge fund manager still that he’s not rampantly bullish because he anticipates a slow grind. Nevertheless, some of the top names within the Paul Tudor Jones portfolio could see significant returns if the underlying prognostication turns out to be accurate.Aiding matters for Paul Tudor Jones’ recommendations centers on the negative print that dominates business headlines. Most worryingly, the debt ceiling debate continues to see no sign of consensus, posing huge concerns for equities. Also, total consumer debt pushed past the $17 trillion level, indicating significant vulnerability.Put another way, the Paul Tudor Jones best bets may be ideally positioned. Because so many anticipate the worst, the fading of a crisis may lift shares – perhaps much more so than the billionaire envisions. Below are three ideas from his portfolio to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPSXPhillips 66$95.56CPTCamden Property Trust$106.27VMWVMware$124.72Phillips 66 (PSX)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOne of the most exciting ideas among Paul Tudor Jones stock picks is downstream energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Specializing in refining and marketing initiatives, Phillips 66 operates where economic rubber meets the road. Therefore, even if Jones is wrong and the economy slips into a deep recession, PSX might perform reasonably well. No matter what, people need to get from point A to point B.As stated bluntly, Phillips 66 benefits from a captive audience. As a result, PSX ranks among the Paul Tudor Jones inflation stocks to buy. Fortunately, it’s not just cynicism undergirding the narrative. Overall, the downstream player enjoys a solid financial backdrop. In particular, its Altman Z-Score prints 4.15, indicating high stability and low bankruptcy risk.Story continuesRight now, PSX ranks as number three in the Paul Tudor Jones portfolio (under Tudor Investment Holdings). It accounts for 0.66% of total holdings, with a market value of $34.59 million. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PSX as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $125.63, implying over 32% upside potential.Camden Property Trust (CPT)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An intriguing but risky idea among Paul Tudor Jones stock picks, Camden Property Trust (NYSE:CPT) is a real estate investment trust that invests in apartments in the U.S. Probably a typical idea for a billionaire, Camden cuts a cynical profile. Basically, with home prices and now interest rates having ballooned to ridiculous levels, workers are now forced to rent indefinitely.However, this evil genius idea among Paul Tudor Jones’ recommendations hasn’t panned out so well this year. Since the Jan. opener, CPT dropped nearly 4% in equity value. And in the past 365 days, shares dropped more than 23%. Nevertheless, CPT ranks within the top 50 of the Paul Tudor Jones portfolio. Camden makes up 0.45% of total holdings, amounting to $23.72 million.

The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comProbably one of the most contested ideas among Paul Tudor Jones stock picks, VMWare (NYSE:VMW) will more than likely require the billionaire’s broader economic thesis to pan out to build on its momentum. In that regard, the pressure is on. A cloud computing and virtualization technology company, VMWare shows some promise. Since the Jan. opener, shares gained nearly 3% of equity value. In the trailing year, they’re up over 31%.However, having gained so much, some investors may be looking to offload some exposure. That sentiment might accelerate if we suffer a downturn. Thus, it’s probably vital that Jones’ thesis rings true. Financially, VMWare presents a mixed bag, incurring soft revenue growth and mediocre strength in the balance sheet. However, it’s consistently profitable and may be undervalued against forward earnings.One of the Paul Tudor Jones best bets, VMW makes up 0.43% of total holdings. Nominally, this translates to $22.42 million. In closing, analysts peg VMW as a consensus hold. Overall, the average price target clocks in at $137.33, implying over 9% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

AMGN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $120.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Amgen shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Staples industry that ranks in the Top 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.67 per share to $4.46 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Amgen right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Moreover, the healthcare industry utilizes Rhenium in various capacities, despite its overall decrease in demand.According to the ""Global Rhenium Market 2022-2026"" report, the Rhenium market is projected to witness substantial growth, with its market share anticipated to grow by $80.27 million by 2026. This growth is expected to occur at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.12% from 2021 to 2026. The market structure of the Rhenium industry is fragmented, with various players operating in the market.Technavio notes that the industry has shown a year-on-year growth of 12.38%, indicating a positive upward trend. In terms of regional analysis, the Rhenium market encompasses North America, Europe, APAC (Asia-Pacific), South America, and the Middle East and Africa. Among these regions, North America holds the largest market share, contributing approximately 65% to the overall market. Key consumer countries driving the demand for Rhenium include the United States, Canada, China, Russia, and Germany.Prominent Rhenium Market Trends To WatchAs the market for Rhenium continues to evolve, several key trends are expected to shape its trajectory. These trends include:Aerospace demand boost: Increasingly, Rhenium alloys are sought after in the aerospace and aviation sectors due to their heat resistance and mechanical strength.Energy sector advancements: Rhenium catalysts are gaining traction in fuel cells and hydrogen production, aligning with the growing demand for renewable energy technologies.Electronics integration: Rhenium's excellent electrical and thermal conductivity properties make it valuable in microelectronics and semiconductors, catering to the expanding electronics industry.Catalyst significance: Rhenium catalysts are finding wider applications in the chemical industry, particularly in petroleum refining, aromatics production, and catalytic reforming.Healthcare sector driving Rhenium-188 demand: The growing use of Rhenium-188 in the healthcare industry is set to generate promising opportunities for the Rhenium market in the foreseeable future.Rhenium-188 in nuclear medicine: Derived from the tungsten-188 generator, Rhenium-188 is a powerful radioisotope emitting high-energy radiation. It is extensively employed in nuclear medicine to produce radiopharmaceuticals used in therapeutic applications such as oncology, interventional radiology, cardiology, and other treatments.Rhenium Production by Country: Top 10 CountriesPhoto by Artyom korshunov on UnsplashMethodologyOur assessment of Rhenium production among various countries involved a meticulous ranking methodology. To ensure the utmost reliability and accuracy of our findings, we extensively researched data from trusted sources such as The United States Geological Survey (USGS). By utilizing production percentages from E3S Web of Conferences, we calculated the production output of France and Germany specifically for the year 2020.  We then ranked the countries in ascending order according to their actual Rhenium production quantities, measured in metric tons. 10. ArmeniaMetric Tons: 0.26Armenia is known for its significant production of the rare metal Rhenium, especially for aerospace and defense industries utilization. The country's major Rhenium production is concentrated from the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine. Armenia's geological conditions and its abundant reserves of copper and molybdenum make it an ideal location for the production of Rhenium. The country's Rhenium production has played a vital role in boosting its economy and making it a significant player in the global metals market.9. KazakhstanMetric Tons: 1Kazakhstan's Rhenium production remained consistent at 1 metric ton in both 2015 and 2016, and this level was maintained in 2021 as well. The country implements a Rhenium recovery process that involves utilizing a sulphuric acid scrubbing solution. A noteworthy aspect of Kazakhstan's Rhenium production is the copper concentrates discovered in Zhezkazgan, which contain up to 30 grams per ton (g/t) of Rhenium.These deposits are globally recognized as the richest known sources of Rhenium. The abundance of Rhenium in these copper concentrates highlights the significant role played by Kazakhstan in meeting the demand for this valuable element, which finds applications in various industrial sectors.8. ChinaMetric Tons: 2.5Many producers in China have traditionally used the Kennecott Process for Rhenium extraction; there is an exception with Jiangxi Copper Corporation. The Kennecott Process has been widely used in the industry for over 40 years to extract Rhenium.In this process, exhaust gasses from the molybdenum roasting circuit are washed with water to produce perrhenic acid. The solution is then treated with chemicals like NaOH and Ca(ClO)2 to remove contaminants and adjust the pH. The solution undergoes ion exchange processing, where a resin adsorbs the Rhenium, which is later stripped using hydrochloric acid. The recovered Rhenium can further undergo purification steps, including recrystallization.Jiangxi Copper Corporation, which was the largest Rhenium producer in China in 2016, has developed and implemented its own production process. Their method includes solvent extraction of the scrubbing liquid, stripping of the organic solvent, purification, and crystallization of NH4ReO4, resulting in a Rhenium yield of up to 92%. Therefore, while the majority of Chinese producers employ the Kennecott Process, Jiangxi Copper Corporation has adopted a different approach to Rhenium recovery.7. Republic of KoreaMetric Tons: 2.8According to USGS, the Republic of Korea produced approximately 2.8 metric tons of Rhenium in 2020 and 2021. South Korea's production of Rhenium underscores its industrial prowess and technological advancements. The country's emphasis on innovation and research has enabled it to become a key player in the global supply chain of this valuable metal. With a focus on meeting market demands and supporting various sectors, South Korea continues to contribute significantly to the production and availability of Rhenium worldwide.6. FranceMetric Tons: 4.24In 2020, France produced approximately 4.24 tons of Rhenium. The country has emerged as one of the leading producers of Rhenium products within Western Europe. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the expansion of the aerospace industry, a thriving automotive sector, increased applications in the biomedical field, and the utilization of Rhenium powder and salt crystals. These factors have collectively contributed to the notable increase in Rhenium production within France.Click to continue reading and see Rhenium Production by Country: Top 5 Countries.Suggested Articles:10 Best Gold Royalty Stocks to Buy Now10 Small-Cap Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Avoiding12 Best Silver Mining Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: none.

(NYSE:M) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$496.0mUS$472.5mUS$843.8mUS$975.0mUS$979.0mUS$984.0mUS$993.5mUS$1.01bUS$1.02bUS$1.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.96%Est @ 1.31%Est @ 1.55%Est @ 1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 13% US$437US$367US$578US$589US$521US$462US$411US$367US$328US$294(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.4bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 13%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (13%– 2.1%) = US$9.4bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$9.4b÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= US$2.7bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.0b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$14.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Macy's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.909. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Macy'sStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Multiline Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The stock now yields 3.4%.To put that in perspective, the average dividend yield of S&amp;P 500 companies stands at just 1.7% at the moment.While Big Oil’s juicy dividends seem attractive in today’s market, not everyone is a fan.For instance, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investors may not want exposure to the sector because the extraction, production and use of oil can lead to carbon emissions, air pollution and climate change.The good news? Hydrocarbon exploration and production is not the only business capable of delivering generous returns to income investors. These days, clean energy stocks can pay oversized dividends, too.Here’s a look at two of them. Wall Street also sees upside in this duo.Don't miss:Closing the Wealth Gap: Investment Fund Delivers Impressive Returns To Its Investors And TenantsElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin. Here's How To Invest In The City's Growth Before He Floods It With New Tech WorkersBrookfield Renewable Partners LP (NYSE: BEP)Brookfield Renewable Partners owns and operates a diverse portfolio of renewable energy assets across North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The partnership invests primarily in hydroelectric, wind, utility-scale solar and storage facilities.As one of the largest publicly traded, pure-play renewable energy platforms in the world, Brookfield Renewable boasts 25,700 megawatts of installed capacity and a development pipeline of around 126,000 megawatts of renewable power assets.Story continuesThe partnership also stands out for its cash returns to investors. In 2001, it paid total distributions of 38 cents per unit. This year, it’s on track to pay $1.35 per unit. That translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6%.At the current unit price, Brookfield Renewable offers an annual distribution yield of 4.2%.The best part? Management aims to sustainably increase the payout over time, with an annual distribution growth target averaging between 5% and 9%.Year to date, Brookfield Renewable stock has already surged more than 20%, and Wells Fargo Securities analyst Jonathan Reeder sees further upside on the horizon. The analyst has an Overweight rating on Brookfield Renewable and a price target of $36 — around 12% above the current levels.Check out: Best High-Yield InvestmentsNextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NEP)NextEra Energy Partners was created by energy company NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE: NEE) to own, manage and acquire clean energy projects that generate steady cash flows.Today, NextEra Energy Partners’ portfolio holds interests in wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., along with natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas and Pennsylvania.Because natural gas is not considered a renewable energy source, NextEra Energy Partners is not a renewables pure-play. However, it recently announced plans to become one.“To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets, and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026,” John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy Partners, said in a press release.As NextEra Energy Partners begins its transition to a 100% pure-play renewable energy investment opportunity, it still plans to be very income investor-friendly.The partnership currently pays quarterly distributions of 84.25 cents per share, giving the stock an attractive annual yield of 5.4%. Management expects to grow the distribution per unit by 12% to 15% per year through at least 2026, although they mentioned that given the current capital market environment, the growth rate will probably be “at or near the bottom end of this range.”Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. analyst Noah Kaye has an Outperform rating on NextEra Energy Partners and a price target of $90, implying a potential upside of 46% from the current levels.The Bottom LineEnergy, whether derived from fossil fuels or renewable sources, underpins the functioning of contemporary society, making many energy stocks a potent source of dividends. But the realm of high-yield investments extends far beyond the energy sector.Other industries, such as those catering to basic human needs like food and shelter, can also provide considerable returns. For those seeking to generate passive income without the volatility often associated with publicly traded stocks, there are avenues to invest in these essential-service businesses through the private market.Read next: Want To Grow Your Wealth Passively?

102,9b4d7d73-7411-3e8d-abd7-5a2841185ff6,NEE,2023-05-27,3 Stocks That Will Soar Past the Debt Ceiling Brouhaha,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-soar-past-debt-113045819.html,1684841445,STORY,"['NEE', 'OXY']","[As if investors haven’t had enough to think about these last few years, now there’s a debt ceiling crisis to consider. But a little perspective can go a long way. First, this isn’t the first time the United States has butted up against its debt ceiling. And despite the posturing on both sides, there is no appetite for having the country default on its obligations. That doesn’t mean that the debt ceiling crisis will get resolved before the 11th hour. In fact, history suggests there’s more drama to come. But history also suggests that there are some sectors that have performed better than others in past debt ceiling crises.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe takeaway is that the debt ceiling impact on the stock market is unknown. Therefore, it’s time for investors to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. This means doing more of what many investors are already doing. In other words, finding stocks that historically perform well regardless of what is happening in the economy. With that in mind, here are three stocks for you to consider as the debt ceiling deadline approaches.  NEENextEra Energy $74.85OXYOccidental Petroleum $59.44GLDSPDR Gold Shares ETF $183.26NextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comIt’s often said that the best offense is a good defense. In the case of debt ceiling stocks to buy that means buying defensive stocks. Some of the best defensive stocks are utility stocks. And one of the best utility stocks to buy during the debt ceiling crisis is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE).  NextEra’s name implies a focus on renewable energy and the company has a number of renewable energy projects in its portfolio. As Larry Ramer reminded InvestorPlace readers, all of these projects are in the United States. That means it will benefit from the tax breaks for clean energy projects passed by Congress in 2022. But NextEra Energy is also a traditional electric utility with one of its largest service areas being in Florida. That means that the company will continue to grow both revenue and earnings on a year-over-year basis. Story continuesNEE stock is currently valued at around 22x earnings and pays an attractive dividend with a current yield of 2.51%.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOne of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks as of late has been Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Buffett recently increased his stake in OXY stock. It’s no secret that Buffett was buying OXY stock throughout 2022. But in a year when oil prices have been volatile, it’s worth noting that Buffett has continued to buy shares of the stock. In fact, his hedge fund’s total stake in the company is now over 24%.  As with many things in life, as the debt ceiling deadline approaches, the devil is in the details. And one sticking point has to do with accelerating the process for approving new energy projects. The Biden administration wants that acceleration limited to clean energy projects. The Republican-led plan out of the House of Representatives is pushing to include fossil fuel projects. Nobody is perfect, and that includes Buffett. But his recent purchase has to at least make you take notice. This is true with OXY stock trading for around 6.7x earnings and with analysts projecting an earnings upside of over 19% for the rest of the year. Coincidentally, that’s almost exactly the percentage gain analysts project for the company’s stock.  SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF Investment index funds concept with letter wooden blocks and lots of different currencies, ETFs to buy. Emerging markets ETFsSource: Eviart / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for an investment that can help guard your portfolio against a worst-case scenario, consider the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD). This is a way to invest in an alternative to the U.S. dollar without owning the physical metal.  Gold has become an attractive investment even as inflation is down from the 40-year highs it reached in 2022. The spot price of gold is up 8% in 2023 as of the market close on May 18, 2023. And many people believe that the price of gold will continue to go higher no matter what happens with the debt ceiling crisis. If the debt ceiling deadline passes without a deal, then many investors will likely flock to gold in an attempt to protect their wealth. But if a deal is reached without spending cuts, inflation is likely to remain above the Federal Reserve’s preferred target.  Either option is bullish for the SPDR Gold Shares fund which is the largest precious metals ETF with $59.44 billion of assets under management (AUM). The fund also has an attractive annual expense ratio of just 0.40% which is significantly below the average of its peers, which is currently around 0.69%.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares have lost about 5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Masco due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Masco Q1 Earnings &amp; Net Sales Beat EstimatesMasco Corporation reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2023. The and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has been benefiting from strong pricing actions and operational improvements.On the other hand, adjusted earnings and net sales declined on a year-over-year basis due to supply-chain challenges and inflation headwinds.Masco’s president and CEO, Keith Allman, said, “While the headwinds we discussed last quarter continue, including softening demand trends, persistent inflation and tighter consumer spending, we have moved quickly to adjust our costs and successfully mitigated margin impact in the first quarter.”Inside the HeadlinesMasco reported adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share, which strongly beat the consensus mark of 65 cents by 33.9% but declined 10.3% from the year-ago figure of 97 cents.Net sales of $1.98 billion topped the consensus estimate of $1.92 billion by 3.1% but decreased 10% from the prior-year period. Net sales fell 9% year over year in local currency. Sales in the North American region decreased 10% from the prior-year figure. Internationally, sales decreased by 9% as reported and by 3% in local currency.Segmental AnalysisPlumbing Products: Sales in the segment fell 10% year over year to $1,222 million.

Adjusted EBITDA also fell 11% year over year to $347 million.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, 2023, Masco had total liquidity of $1.3 billion versus $1.45 billion in 2022 and $1.22 billion at March 2022-end.

Net cash to operating activities was $33 million for the first quarter versus net cash for operating activities of $227 million in the prior-year period.During the reported period, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares for $56 million.2023 Guidance MaintainedAdjusted earnings are projected within $3.10-$3.40 per share. This indicates a decline from the 2022 level of $3.77 per share. Net sales are likely to decrease 10% in 2023, with Plumbing Products falling 10-14% and Decorative Architectural Products declining 5-10%.Adjusted operating margin for the year is projected to be 15%, including 16% for both segments.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.02% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Masco has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Masco has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

110,b648a693-6b8f-3056-8121-4bdd2906af18,PHM,2023-05-27,Home Builder Stocks Could Be Strong for Years to Come,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-builder-stocks-could-strong-165100919.html,1685119860,STORY,"['DHI', 'PHM']","[The home builder industry has firmly established itself as one of the leading sectors in the stock market, delivering a remarkable performance over the past year. Home builders currently sit in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank, with 10 stocks scoring a Zacks Rank #1.Fueled by a confluence of factors, including a persistent scarcity in housing supply and a decline in interest rates over the last year, the industry has enjoyed an upward trajectory with no signs of slowing down. This was a huge surprise for many on Wall Street, as most analysts projected a recession at the beginning of the year, which should have challenged the sector.Furthermore, bolstered by improving earnings estimates and reasonable valuations, home builder stocks appear as compelling investments, with strong return potential for investors. Although there are a number of stocks in the sector with convincing fundamentals, I will focus on D.R. Horton DHI, PulteGroup PHM, and NVR NVR, which have all outperformed the market YTD and over the last decade.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchD.R. HortonAfter experiencing some aggressive downgrades in the second half of 2022, DHI is back to being upgraded again. D.R. Horton boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates have been revised 20-30% higher across timeframes over the last two months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNot only is DHI a steady grower, and well positioned in the current housing environment, but management is also generous with returning cash to shareholders. DHI has a dividend yield of 1%, which has been increased by an average of 15% annually over the last five years. Additionally, over the last five years, the share count has been reduced by 10% thanks to stock buy-back programs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDHI is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 10.2x, which is in line with the industry average, and below its 10-year median of 11.6x. Additionally, the industry itself is below its 10-year median of 11.1x.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVRNVR is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) home builder stock, with upward trending earnings revisions. In the chart below we can see just how severe the revisions lower were going into the end of 2022, and how strongly they have rebounded this year. It should be noted that estimates are still below what they were a year ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnlike other homebuilders, NVR’s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry.NVR acquires finished lots at market prices from various third-party land developers under the Lot Purchase Agreements so that the legal obligation and economic loss is limited to the amount of the deposit, in case of failure.The lot acquisition strategy helps the company to avoid financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. This strategy allows it to gain efficiency and a competitive edge over its peers.NVR has managed to expand Net Margins considerably over the last ten years, in part thanks to this strategy. Over that time margins have nearly tripled from 6% to 16%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVR is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 13.3x, which is above the industry average 9.8x, but below its 10-year median of 16x. However, with its unique acquisition strategy, and high margins, NVR likely earns a premium valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPulteGroupPulteGroup stock is blasting to new all-time highs as well. After being downgraded through the end of 2022, investors are now caught flat-footed as earnings estimates are revised higher and the stock charges higher. Pulte also enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting the strong trend in earnings estimates upgrades.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPHM is very generous with its investors as well, making huge efforts to return cash to shareholders. In addition to reducing its share count by 40% over the last ten years though buybacks, PHM also offers a dividend which is has raised every year since 2012. The dividend payment has been increased by an average of 12% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPHM is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 7.7x, which is well below the industry average 10.3x, and below its 10-year median of 10.4x. This is an attractive valuation for a company with a long history of growing sales, returning cash to shareholders, and benefiting from secular tightness in its respective market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInterest RatesIn the chart below of the Ten-Year Treasury yield, we can see that interest rates peaked back in November 2022 and have trended lower since. If you compare this chart with the home builder stocks, you will see that home builders began to rally exactly when rates peaked. This isn’t surprising as lower mortgage rates lead to more home buying.Additionally, we can now be relatively confident that interest rates will continue to trend lower because of rhetoric from the Federal Reserve. After raising interest rates 5% since 2021, the Fed has now made it clear that they are close to, if not completely done raising interest rates. Lower rates mean cheaper mortgages, which should encourage further strength in home buying.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewHousing SupplyAnyone that has tried buying a house in the last two years knows just how competitive the market has been. And anyone that hasn’t tried buying a home has read about it or spoken to someone that has. Besides several markets that were exceptionally hot during the post-Covid boom, most local real estate markets have remained extremely supply constrained.The housing boom and bust of 2008 had something of a traumatic effect on housing developers, because since then housing supply has collapsed. Even in more recent years we can see that the amount of active real estate listings has more than halved in the last five years. Because of this, home builders and their products are an extremely hot commodity.St Louis FedImage Source: St Louis FedBottom LineEven after the strong run up in the industry, home builder stocks are still compelling investments. High Zacks Ranks and technical chart patterns make them strong near-term investment candidates. While secular tailwinds, and low valuations make them very attractive long-term investments. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Meritage Homes Q1 Earnings Beat, Margins Fall Y/YMeritage Homes reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2023. Both earnings and total closing revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The metrics, however, declined from the year-ago quarter’s levels, thanks to ongoing macroeconomic woes.Phillippe Lord, the CEO of MTH, said, ""We believe our focus on pace over price and commitment to our spec inventory position us well to capitalize on buyer demand and continue to gain market share. We expect the undersupply of new and resale home inventory as well as favorable demographics provide a strong long-term runway for the homebuying market.""Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionEarnings of $3.54 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 by 41% but declined 39% year over year from $5.79 posted a year ago. Lower gross margin and overhead leverage hurt the bottom line.Total revenues (including Homebuilding and Financial Services revenues) amounted to $1.285 billion compared with $1.29 billion reported in the year-ago period.Segment DiscussionHomebuilding: Total closing revenues totaled $1,279.3 million, slipping 0.6% from the prior-year quarter’s level of $1,286.9 million. The metric beat the consensus mark of $1,012 million by 26.4%. Home closing revenues totaled $1,261.9 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year quarter’s level of $1,245.5 million. This was backed by stabilizing housing demand as interest rates dipped slightly.MTH reported 2,897 units of homes closed, up marginally from 2,858 units year over year. The average sales price (ASP) was flat from a year ago at $436,000.Total home orders fell 10% from the prior year to 3,487 homes. In dollars, home orders fell 15% year over year to $1.5 billion on a 5% lower ASP. The decline was due to a 15% cancellation rate. Average absorptions per store was 4.2 per month, down from 4.9 per month a year ago. The average community count increased 4.2% year over year to 274.5 homes.Entry-level buyers represented 87% of sales orders compared with 83% in the year-ago quarter.Quarter-end backlog totaled 3,922 units, down 41% year over year. The value of the backlog also decreased by 42% year over year to $1.76 billion.Adjusted home closing gross margin contracted by 790 basis points (bps) to 22.4% due to the combined effect of greater sales incentives and continued elevated direct costs.

The Librexia program will provide extensive data from nearly 50,000 patients.Librexia STROKE is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of milvexian in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention after an acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). Librexia ACS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of milvexian after a recent acute coronary syndrome. Librexia AF is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of milvexian versus apixaban in participants with atrial fibrillation.The designation is intended to fasten the development and review timelines of drugs when preliminary nonclinical and clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies to address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The benefits of this designation include close communication between the FDA and the sponsor to improve the efficiency of product development to get new therapeutics to patients faster.Bristol Myers and Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen collaborated in 2018 for the development and commercialization of milvexian. Per the deal, Janssen will pay BMY potential development and regulatory milestone payments.Story continuesBristol Myers shares have lost 10.6% in the year so far compared with the industry's decline of 9.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe successful development of new drugs will enable Bristol Myers to diversify its product base and offset the slowdown in top-line growth as one of its prime drugs, Revlimid, is facing generic competition.The company also announced results from the primary analysis of the pivotal TRANSCEND CLL 004 study, a phase I/II, open-label, single-arm multicenter study evaluating Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel, liso-cel) in adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Results from the primary analysis showed 18.4% of patients treated with Breyanzi achieved a complete response (CR) and the median duration of CR was not reached at a median follow-up of 21.1 months.Bristol Myers beat first-quarter 2023 earnings estimates but missed on sales, which declined year over year due to continued generic competition for Revlimid. Generic competition for Eliquis is another headwind.Bristol Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some top-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Ligand Pharmaceuticals LGND and Novartis NVS.

Cramer highlighted the positive earnings reports of various medical device companies, indicating a growing bullish trend. This article examines the factors contributing to this market's growth and identifies key companies that have demonstrated promising performance.A Potential Bull MarketCramer emphasized the emergence of a bullish market in medical devices, noting the consistently positive earnings results shared by multiple companies in the industry. He expressed his hope for a debt ceiling-related sell-off, which would temporarily lower market prices and present investors with an opportunity to purchase medical device stocks at discounted prices.Non-Urgent Surgeries ReboundIn the wake of the pandemic, hospitals faced overwhelming challenges, leading to the deferral of non-essential surgeries. As the crisis subsided, the resumption of these non-urgent procedures fueled an increase in the sale of medical devices. This rebound has contributed to solid earnings and overall growth of the industry.Here we discuss four Medical Device companies — InMode INMD, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and GE HealthCare GEHC — that have strong potential to gain going forward on the back of a recovery in demand for surgeries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInMode Capitalizes on Minimally-Invasive Radio Frequency DevicesCramer highlighted InMode as one of the companies benefiting from market growth. InMode is renowned for its development of minimally-invasive radio frequency devices primarily used in cosmetic surgery. The company's recent earnings report indicated a 43% rise in consumables and service revenues. Though INMD’s stock declined following the report, Cramer attributed this to conservative projections by the company's executives and considered it an opportunity to purchase InMode stock at an undervalued price, which is down 9.6% so far this year.Story continuesInMode Ltd. PriceInMode Ltd. PriceInMode Ltd. price | InMode Ltd. QuoteJohnson &amp; Johnson Sees Success of Medical Devices DivisionCramer pointed out Johnson &amp; Johnson as another potential beneficiary of the bullish market. In April, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, partially driven by the success of its medical devices division. Cramer noted that while JNJ is currently dealing with legal challenges related to its talc products and their potential link to ovarian cancer, the primary concern lies in litigation risks rather than earnings. J&amp;J is down 12.6% so far this year.Johnson &amp; Johnson PriceJohnson &amp; Johnson PriceJohnson &amp; Johnson price | Johnson &amp; Johnson QuoteIntuitive Surgical Records Impressive Growth in Robotic SurgeryIntuitive Surgical, the manufacturer of the robotic Da Vinci Surgical System, delivered a remarkable quarter, surpassing expectations. Although the number of robotic surgery systems sold by ISRG remained consistent with the previous year, there was a significant 26% increase in the number of procedures performed worldwide. Cramer highlighted the company's strong performance, with Intuitive Surgical's stock experiencing a 14.4% increase year to date.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteGE HealthCare Diagnostic Equipment Division in FocusCramer also mentioned GE HealthCare as a company of interest. GE HealthCare's exceptional diagnostic equipment division, which includes a range of scanners crucial for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease, is likely to be the key factor driving GEHC’s performance going forward. Cramer predicted an increasing demand for these machines as the FDA approves more Alzheimer's drugs, underscoring the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of new medications. GE HealthCare has gained 32% so far this year.GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. PriceGE HealthCare Technologies Inc. PriceGE HealthCare Technologies Inc. price | GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. QuoteConclusionThe medical device industry is currently witnessing the start of a bullish market, backed by positive earnings reports from various companies. Factors such as the rebound of non-urgent surgeries and advancements in medical technology contribute to the sector's growth. Investors are keeping a close eye on companies like InMode, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, and GE HealthCare, which have demonstrated a strong performance and hold potential for future success.While InMode carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), the remaining three companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $70 per barrel.The business model of most energy players, by its inherent nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to focus on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc WMB.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well poised to gain, and hence investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan is poised to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.Story continuesMPLX: The firm has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to buy back the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies: It is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market.

Two of them were headquartered roughly 45 miles apart in San Francisco and Santa Clara.The other regional banks under the most scrutiny from investors in 2023 are also clustered near the West Coast. Stocks of PacWest (PACW), Western Alliance (WAL), Zions (ZION) and HomeStreet (HMST) – mid-sized lenders based in Beverly Hills, Calif., Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Seattle – are down between 40% and 79% year to date.""You're not seeing this in other parts of the country,"" Tim Coffey, analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, told Yahoo Finance earlier this month.There is no single reason why the West is under so much pressure. Some of the banks that failed or came under scrutiny share certain characteristics, including unrealized losses on certain assets or large amounts of uninsured depositors or exposure to certain types of clients. But some don’t.Certainly panic and contagion and human psychology are also factors, as are the actions of some investors that see opportunity to benefit from weaker institutions.Some of these Western banks say their fundamental soundness is being overlooked amid the chaos.""Exogenous events over the past two months have created a clear disconnect between our stock price and the underlying strength of our bank,"" Western Alliance Chief Financial Officer Dale Gibbons told Yahoo Finance. Its stock is down 40% for the year.HomeStreet CEO Mark Mason told Yahoo Finance his company’s market valuation “is reserved for companies that are in danger of failing and we’re just not.” HomeStreet’s stock closed Friday at $5.72, down 79% year to date.'I don't think there was just one factor'The question of why so many banking problems are on one side of the US came up in a House hearing earlier this month. Republican representative Young Kim, who is from California, asked California’s top banking regulator Cloey Hewlett to explain the confluence of failures.Story continuesThere have been three so far in one state. Silvergate Bank in La Jolla wound itself down voluntarily, while Santa Clara’s Silicon Valley Bank and San Francisco’s First Republic were seized by regulators in what became the nation’s third-largest and second-largest bank failures ever.""Why do you think California financial institutions are bearing the brunt of the current distress?"" Kim asked Hewlett, commissioner of the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation.""I don’t think there was just one factor there,"" Hewlett said, speaking specifically about Silicon Valley Bank. ""There were numerous factors that created the perfect storm,' and 'once that fear starts, it spreads.""What some of the Western banks, but not all, have in common is exposure to the riches created in Silicon Valley during an era of low interest rates. Some lent to venture capital firms, tech entrepreneurs or wealthy people in the California communities where the tech business thrived.Some, as a result, amassed piles of deposits that were too large to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In turn, they also amassed bonds and loans that declined in value when interest rates rose, creating paper losses.The scene outside a Silicon Valley Bank branch on the day the lender was seized by regulators. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The uninsured deposits became especially critical for Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to startups and tech entrepreneurs that spooked its customers when it disclosed taking an actual loss on underwater bonds. Many clients that had deposits over the FDIC limit of $250,000 per account pulled their money at once; more than $40 billion left the bank in one day.""If you think about why the West, the predominant aspect is that there was a higher set of banks in that area that have a large proportion of funding coming from uninsured depositors,"" Tomasz Piskorski, Columbia Business School professor of finance and real estate, told Yahoo Finance.First Republic got caught in that crossfire. It also had a high percentage of uninsured deposits and mostly catered to high net worth clients by offering jumbo mortgages at low rates. It also at one time had branches on Silicon Valley’s famed Sand Hill Road.Former First Republic Bank CEO Michael Roffler told lawmakers that ""everything changed overnight."" (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)It lost $40 billion in deposits on the Monday after Silicon Valley Bank failed and more than $100 billion in the weeks that followed. Regulators seized it on May 1 and sold the bulk of its operations to JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Its top executive said that rumors and misconceptions about the bank spread by social media contributed to its fall. “Everything changed overnight,” First Republic CEO Michael Roffler told House lawmakers earlier this month.How this is different than 2008The last severe banking crisis also began with stresses on the West Coast, in 2008.In July of that year, Pasadena, Calif-based regional bank IndyMac went down after a run on its deposits and a troubled Calabasas, Calif-based mortgage lender called Countrywide sold itself to Bank of America. In September of that year, Seattle’s Washington Mutual became the largest-ever bank failure in US history (and still is).But there were as many weaknesses on the East Coast as there were in the West, especially on Wall Street. Bear Stearns had to be rescued by JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch had to be saved by Bank of America.In subsequent years, as housing problems rolled through the rest of the country, more banks went down in Georgia and Florida than in California.This year, the eastern half of the US wasn’t completely immune to the turmoil. New York City-based Signature Bank became one of the first banks to fall in March.More banks outside the West could still experience stress, too. Piskorski and four other professors identified 186 smaller US lenders that have large amounts of uninsured depositors and are thus vulnerable to runs if panic mounts again.""They're all over the US,"" he added.Investors, though, are still more willing to bet that some of the Western institutions will get weaker. The regional banks that are currently the target of the most short bets as a percentage of all shares are PacWest, Bank of Hawaii, Western Alliance and Zions, according to data from S3 Partners.A view of Western Alliance headquarters in downtown Phoenix. (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)PacWest, Western Alliance and Zions all lost deposits during the first quarter, which may help explain the extra scrutiny they received. PacWest and Western Alliance also at one time had venture-lending arms, just as Silicon Valley Bank did.All have all been working to turn investor sentiment around. PacWest’s stock surged this past week after announcing asset sales to two different buyers. Western Alliance has been providing weekly updates about its performance, and its latest was that deposits had risen $2 billion since the end of the first quarter.""Genuine investors understand that we have a strong balance sheet, quality assets, and a diversified deposit base,"" said Gibbons, the Western Alliance CFO. ""Those fundamentals were true in February and they are true today.""HomeStreet's CEO said his strategy is to shrink the bank's balance sheet, prevent deposit outflows and temporarily suspend lending of fixed-rate loans until interest rates settle. Its profits dropped 40% during the first quarter.Like other banking executives, Mason is also calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend the practice of short selling. He said he believes investors are coordinating on social media to push the bank's stock price lower.""I think that a group attack or herd positioning is real. I know it is. It's not just a rumor,"" he said. ""When stocks get beaten down this far, way beyond the fundamentals, that's not price discovery any longer. That's abusive short selling.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
128,2ec24598-3ed4-3ac5-9871-430a220cea30,WFC,2023-05-27,Bank of America (BAC) May Face Benefit Card Fraud Lawsuit,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-bac-may-face-151900166.html,1685114340,STORY,"['BAC', 'SDAWW', 'WFC', 'HSBC']","[Bank of America Corporation BAC should face a lawsuit for its failure to respond to unauthorized transactions on unemployment and disability benefits cards in California in 2020, per the U.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns. The news was reported by Reuters.The San Diego judge asked the affected cardholders to move ahead with a proposed class action lawsuit against BofA, claiming that it violated state law by issuing cards to millions of people in California that lacked standard security measures.Per the benefits recipients, the bank broke federal law by failing to investigate fraud claims or summarily freezing tens of thousands of accounts.The cardholders also claimed that BofA was unable to follow the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which sets rules for banks to resolve account errors.BAC also violated California’s consumer privacy law by issuing cards with outdated magnetic stripes, rather than chip technology, leaving them subject to fraud.Hence, Burns said that the cardholders should move ahead with the above-mentioned claims and others.However, Burns dismissed claims that BofA violated California’s Unfair Competition Law and that it breached its contract with the state.A spokesperson for Bank of America refused to respond immediately to a request for comment yesterday.BofA had previously agreed to cease using automated fraud detection software to freeze accounts.Our TakeDespite Bank of America’s cost-saving initiatives, continued legal issues faced by the entity are expected to increase its expense base in the near term. Elevated costs will, thus, hurt the company’s bottom line to an extent.In May 2022, BAC was asked to pay a penalty of $10 million by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) for processing illegal, out-of-state garnishment orders against customer bank accounts, thus violating state laws.BofA allegedly froze customer accounts unlawfully, sent payments to creditors based on out-of-state garnishment court orders and charged garnishment fees on its customers’ accounts. However, the payments made to creditors should have been processed under the laws of the states where the customers lived.In July 2022, the bank was fined $225 million by a pair of U.S. banking regulators over “botched” handling of jobless benefits during the pandemic.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and CFPB said that BAC had a faulty fraud detection program that improperly froze the prepaid card accounts of thousands of people seeking jobless benefits in 2020-2021.Apart from the fine, it was asked to pay redress to harmed consumers, which CFPB estimated would amount to hundreds of millions of dollars more.Over the past six months, shares of BAC have lost 23.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 14.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Bank of America carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Financial Misconduct by Other FirmsEarlier this month, Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC agreed to pay $1 billion related to a lawsuit accusing it of overstating the progress on resolving its 2016 fake account scandal and thereby defrauding shareholders.Since 2018, WFC has been under consent orders from the Federal Reserve and two other financial regulators to improve its governance and oversight.But shareholders alleged that Wells Fargo and its past management misinformed them about how swiftly the company was addressing the governance issues and risk-management systems due to which the bank opened millions of fake accounts. Accordingly, when these shortcomings surfaced, WFC's market value fell by more than $54 billion over two years ending in March 2020.However, Wells Fargo denied any wrongdoing and decided to settle to eliminate further litigation expenses.HSBC Holdings plc HSBC was charged by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) for manipulative and deceptive trading, and record-keeping failures. Units of HSBC agreed to pay $75 million to settle the charges.Per CFTC’s claim, between March 2012 and April 2016, HSBC traders engaged in manipulative and deceptive trading in interest rate swaps and other financial products.HSBC has already been penalized by the Securities and Exchange Commission for related charges.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The drug was initially grantedemergency use authorization (“EUA”) by the FDA in 2021 for a similar indication.The FDA’s decision is primarily based on data from the phase II/III EPIC-HR study, which evaluated Paxlovid in unvaccinated, non-hospitalized adults aged 18 years and older. Patients who were administered Paxlovid within five days of symptom onset showed 86% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death.Pfizer also confirmed that Paxlovid’s distribution will continue to be overseen by the U.S. government, with certain country residents eligible to receive the medicine at no charge.Shares of Pfizer have lost 26.2% in the year so far against the industry’s 0.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaxlovid will continue to remain available under EUA to treat pediatric patients (aged 12-17 years) and weighing at least 40 kg with COVID-19. Pfizer is currently conducting the ongoing phase II/III EPIC-Peds study to gather pediatric data on the drug and intends to file a supplemental new drug application (“sNDA”), with the FDA seeking full approval for use of Paxlovid in the 12–17-year age group.Other than Pfizer, Merck MRK also developed its own oral antiviral for COVID-19, molnupiravir. The Merck antiviral, which is marketed under the brand name Lagevrio, received EUA from the FDA in December 2021 for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options are not clinically appropriate.

135,672104eb-5696-3ade-bdad-77d845a6b671,PFE,2023-05-27,Pfizer weight loss drug may be as effective as competitors: Study,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/pfizer-weight-loss-drug-may-140002196.html,1685109602,VIDEO,"['NONOF', 'NVO', 'PFE']","[Yahoo Finance Live health care reporter Anjalee Khemlani details the clinical trial results of Pfizer's weight loss drug Danuglipron, how it compares to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, and examines the adoption of weight loss drugs in the health and wellness space.Video Transcript- Meantime, Pfizer is entering the weight loss drug space for the first time. On Monday, a new peer-reviewed study of Pfizer's phase II clinical trial results showed that Pfizer's oral weight loss drug could be as effective as rival Novo Nordisk Ozempic. Studies around weight loss drugs are ramping up, and it shows in the concentrated efforts these pharmaceutical companies are making. We have here with us Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani to tell us more. Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So listen, we know of course, there's been a lot of discussion around weight loss drugs, and in particular, the type 2 drugs that are being used for weight loss in eligible patients. But what's really happening now is this focus on the weight loss part and obesity really ramping up.You're seeing the dovetailing of interests, including those who have been advocating for recognizing obesity as a chronic disease for quite some time, as well as now, this new generation of what is known as GLP-1s. And they've been around for some time. But this new generation is really, really what has caused a lot of interest.So let's take a look at what we have on the market right now. We know that there's of course, the Eli Lilly, we've got Novo Nordisk, and we've also got Mounjaro. And we've got now these oral versions, because those are all injectable. So Novo Nordisk with its phase III trial, that's the leader in this area, Pfizer, like you just talked about in phase II, and Eli Lilly just starting on its oral options as of this week. So we've got a lot on the table, looking at a rollout for the next couple of years.Meanwhile, we know that companies are starting to already prescribe these for obesity alone. That includes companies like Weight Watchers and Noom, which we've talked about this week, really switching gears from what they've been pushing before, which is more behavioral and lifestyle. And then telehealth platforms like Ro who are also jumping on the bandwagon.Story continuesSo that's sort of where you see this focus right now. It's something that is really of concern. We've seen how insurance companies have been pushing back on coverage. And there's a reason behind that. So I got a chance to talk to Found CEO Sarah Simmer, and she had this to say about this. In discussions with employer, she said they're seeing Ozempic go from not even the top 20 of drug costs to literally number one within six months time. One employer said that Ozempic prescriptions had increased 400% year on year.Now, that's clearly not type 2 diabetes patients jumping up 400% year on year. So what's in the pipeline right now we know is focusing on a number of things. It's not just about the weight loss, that's the positive, but also other byproducts and other comorbidities too, type 2 diabetes. So while taking type 2 diabetes drugs, does have these side effects that we know about with those impact in Wegovy, and the like, like nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.We've also seen on the plus side with the weight loss they are seeing signals for potential improvement in stroke and reduced heart attack in these patients. So that's where even more enthusiasm is coming from the scientific community. So that's why you're hearing a lot about these drugs even though they've actually been around for some time. But you're starting to see even more enthusiasm around them for this.- Because they're working too. That's part of the enthusiasm that you're seeing around them. And I mean-- and Noom, obviously part of it. Yes, they had a behavioral, but maybe some of the behaviors aren't working and they're trying to figure out how do they repeat customers.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: It also helps accelerate that process. And an important point on the oral part is also to help diabetics move away from needles. That's like a really big push in the type 2 diabetes community.- Just a couple of-- I have so many questions, but just a couple of things to mention. You talked about the platforms that are now using these. The ones that don't seem to be like a HIMSS, Hims and Hers actually has recently been seeing its stock drop. It's up today. But like for the week, it's been seeing some rockiness there.I also want to ask you about supply, though, because that has also been a big issue here for the people that need this stuff. Not for weight loss, but for diabetes.- But for diabetes.- Are we seeing these various companies do a big ramp up in production to meet this now increased demand?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, because they're specifically catering for type 2, it's based on that population and what they expect those prescriptions to be. You saw, for example--- So wait, they're not basing it on this new weight loss demand also?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Because it's not-- not all those drugs are indicated for--- Because they're off label.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: They're off label. And on the HIMSS part, they want to. They're waiting. So it's not like it's completely off the table. So you're seeing some of the people cautiously--- Of course, they want to.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Everyone wants too. It's a big moneymaker. That's why these drug makers are even in this business. That's why you saw Pfizer quietly working on this. Do you know Eli Lilly?- It has to be. We'll be left behind if they're not.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Eli was-- exactly. Eli Lilly, this drug, they actually acquired it from a Roche subunit in 2018. That oral version that they're developing is from 2018. So this has been in the works for quite some time. It's been developing as a hot area. I think COVID just kind of put it to the side for some time.- Yeah.- I just can't help wondering how all of this could backfire. I mean, maybe that's my own bias showing. But like, I think of the diet pills of the past and they've never--- Yeah, it's hard to remember them.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: You've got a point there. So long term impacts is what clinicians are looking for, what ""Ozempic face"" as it's known, or what are the longer term--- Wait, what does Ozempic face?- Well, that they lose weight so fast that they have Ozempic face where their face just, I guess, sags. So they're calling it Ozempic face right now.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And also the weight named after you get off it. And then what are the--- Right. And that's one of the challenges.- And what if you stay on it forever.- Do you have to stay on this for life?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Right, and the cost that goes with it. So there's a lot of unknowns. And they haven't even tested these in healthy obese populations. Eli Lilly just announced that they're starting a trial. And that's it's very complicated. That's why you're hearing just like the surface buzz about it. But underneath, if you sat and did the research I just did for the past week, you'd see just how complex this area is.- Well, and forget about testing it on healthy obese people. What about testing it on healthy people--ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Who are not obese.- --who are not obese who are now using it--- That which some are. I mean, it's apparently, it's very popular on the West Coast. All right, we're going to put a bookmark in this.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: We can have a whole segment on this.- I love this conversation, Anj. Thank you so much.]"

137,179cce96-7f74-348a-8ac6-19d93d69af7c,PYPL,2023-05-27,"Investors Heavily Search PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-paypal-holdings-130011477.html,1685106011,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -20.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 10.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of +25.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 points to a change of +19.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.70 indicates a change of +15.4% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.51 billion and $32.11 billion estimates indicate +7.2% and +8.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.69%. The EPS surprise was +6.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Activist Billionaire Paul Singer 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Billionaire and activist investor Paul Singer, who heads Elliott Management, is growing bearish on the financial markets. A Wall Street Journal report recently quoted the billionaire, who cautioned investors about an extended period of diminished profits in financial assets due to escalating concerns of a recession. Singer expressed his belief that the US economy is currently navigating through an exceptionally hazardous and bewildering phase. He explained: ""Valuations are still very high. There's a significant chance of recession. We see the possibility of a lengthy period of low returns in financial assets, low returns in real estate, corporate profits, unemployment rates higher than exist now and lots of inflation in the next round.""Paul Singer was among the early individuals to anticipate and alert about the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, and he also raised concerns about elevated inflation at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to WSJ, in a letter addressed to investors in April 2020, Singer wrote: “We think it is very unlikely that central bankers will move to normalize monetary policy after the current emergency is over. They did not normalize last time and the world has moved demonstrably closer to a tipping point after which money printing, prices and the growth of debt are in an upward spiral that the monetary authorities realize cannot be broken except at the cost of a deep recession and credit collapse.”Singer, known for his high-profile conflict with Argentina regarding its defaulted debt, holds a critical stance towards comprehensive banking regulations, such as those outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as prolonged market interventions by global central banks following the 2008 global financial crisis. He also stressed his lack of enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, describing them as ""completely devoid of any value"" during his interview with the Wall Street Journal. He added: Story continues“There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. That’s why they’re worth zero. Anybody can make one. All they are is nothing with a marketing pitch—literally nothing.”Bloomberg noted that Elliott Management achieved its largest-ever capital raise in 2022, totaling $13 billion. Employing a drawdown approach, Elliott secures commitments from investors, but the actual cash is called upon at a later date. Since its establishment in 1977, the hedge fund has experienced losses in only two years. In this article, we discuss the activist billionaire’s top 10 stock picks as of March end, which include Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC). Our Methodology For this list, we selected top 10 stocks from the Q1 2023 13F portfolio of Paul Singer’s Elliott Management.

E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO)Elliott Management’s Stake Value: $111,542,168Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO)  offers a software platform for managing and coordinating supply chains, which operates on the cloud and covers the entire process from start to finish. In Q1 2023, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management owned 19.16 million shares of E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) worth $111.5 million, representing 0.82% of the total 13F securities. On May 2, Credit Suisse upgraded E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $5, down from $5.50. The firm mentioned that the company's guidance for organic revenue growth in FY24 is 1.6%, which takes into account a slow first half of the year due to integration challenges and macro-related churn. However, they expect the situation to stabilize in the second half. The firm noted that although they would have preferred a more cautious approach, they believe E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) has enough demand in its sales pipeline to meet the revenue target for the entire year. Credit Suisse further stated that the company's increased focus on organic growth, the adjusted guidance, and the current valuation all contribute to a more balanced outlook for the company's shares in the next 12 months.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 24 hedge funds were bullish on E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO), compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Snehal Amin’s Windacre Partnership is the largest stakeholder of the company. Like Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) is one of the top stock picks of activist billionaire Paul Singer. Here is what Baron Small Cap Fund has to say aboutE2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“E2open Inc. provides a 100% cloud-based software platform to orchestrate complex global supply chains. Its end-to-end SaaS solutions are mission critical. They drive compelling value and ROI for a diverse, blue-chip customer base (including Dell, Peloton, and Boeing) by helping them optimize their supply chains across channel shaping, demand sensing, business planning, logistics, global trade, and supply management.The market for supply chain management is large ($45 billion-plus market) and has only increased in complexity and importance due to the COVID pandemic. E2open’s deeply embedded products enable strong retention (107% net retention) and long customer relationships (top 100 customers have a 14-year average tenure). Relative to the competition, E2open has devised an elegant and simple solution that is faster and nimbler compared to legacy ERP vendors, and its single interface for all participants compares favorably to the many point solutions out in the market.E2open is poised to accelerate its organic revenue growth to about 10% in the upcoming fiscal year and maintain a low double-digit level over the medium term. Due to long-term contracts, the company has high visibility into future annual growth, and we expect acceleration will be driven by several factors, including expanding existing customer relationships ($1 billion white space alone), winning new customers, optimizing the sales force, getting better pricing realization, and enhancing strategic partnerships. Acquisitions are expected to be the primary use of free cash flow and should supplement the organic growth and provide meaningful synergies once integrated into E2open’s platform. The company has an attractive margin profile (low 30% increasing to high 30%’s adjusted EBITDA margins) paired with strong FCF generation. We believe that E2open will be a steady earnings compounder, which should drive solid returns for the stock over a multi-year period.”9. Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE)Elliott Management’s Stake Value: $112,489,500Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE) is an offshore drilling contractor that serves the oil and gas industry. The company offers contract drilling services worldwide using its fleet of mobile offshore drilling units. Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that Paul Singer’s hedge fund held 2.85 million shares of Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE), worth $112.4 million and representing 0.83% of the total portfolio. On May 4, Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 and a revenue of $610 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $73 million, respectively. Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE) maintained its previously communicated guidance for the full year of 2023. The company expects total revenue to fall within the range of $2.35 billion to $2.55 billion, with a consensus estimate of $2.42 billion. Noble also anticipates adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million and capital expenditures to be between $325 million and $365 million.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 45 hedge funds were long Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE), compared to 50 funds in the prior quarter. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.45 million shares worth $136.4 million. ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“As mentioned, we remain very positive on energy given the structural global shortage. However, with the cost structure of shale rising from higher services costs and well productivity falling, we made the decision to pivot from shorter-cycle shale production to longer-cycle conventional oil. We believe the current environment suggests that pricing power in energy services will continue to improve while the demand for offshore oil will increase. We invested in Noble Corporation Plc (NYSE:NE), in the energy sector, an offshore drilling contractor that targets ultra-deepwater and high-specification jackup markets, which we believe will be a major beneficiary of this shift. After emerging from bankruptcy caused by the recent severe downcycle, Noble has a recapitalized balance sheet moving into a positive pricing cycle that will drive dramatic growth in earnings and free cash flow. Like other parts of energy, the nightmare of the last cycle is reinforcing capital discipline and a focus on free cash flow rather than growth. We believe this subsequent longer duration cycle is not reflected in Noble’s current stock price, and long-term performance will be supported by growing shareholder returns from dividends and buybacks while maintaining a strong balance sheet.”8. Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL)Elliott Management’s Stake Value: $128,168,200Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL) offers offshore contract drilling services to the global oil and gas industry. The company possesses a fleet of offshore drilling rigs, comprising drillships, dynamically positioned semi-submersible rigs, moored semi-submersible rigs, and jackup rigs. In Q1 2023, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management held 1.97 million shares of Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL), worth $128.16 million and representing 0.94% of the total portfolio.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Molson Coors Beverage's shares before the 1st of June in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.41 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.64 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Molson Coors Beverage has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current stock price of $60.64. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Molson Coors Beverage's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Molson Coors Beverage can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Molson Coors Beverage's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If Molson Coors Beverage didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Fortunately, it paid out only 33% of its free cash flow in the past year.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Molson Coors Beverage reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Molson Coors Beverage has delivered 2.5% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Molson Coors Beverage's financial health, by checking our visualisation of its financial health, here.The Bottom LineIs Molson Coors Beverage an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're a bit uncomfortable with it paying a dividend while being loss-making. However, we note that the dividend was covered by cash flow. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Molson Coors Beverage don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business.

141,fa3084db-ec86-3df7-bd93-29352c8358f3,MKC,2023-05-27,"With A Return On Equity Of 14%, Has McCormick & Company, Incorporated's (NYSE:MKC) Management Done Well?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-equity-14-mccormick-company-133654290.html,1685108214,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V']","[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for McCormick How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for McCormick is:14% = US$666m ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.Does McCormick Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see McCormick has a similar ROE to the average in the Food industry classification (13%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining McCormick's Debt And Its 14% Return On EquityMcCormick clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.07. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

142,5b0f3b69-203b-300d-985d-3c94d1cc584b,MKC,2023-05-27,4 Grocery Stocks to Buy on Jump in April Online Sales,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-grocery-stocks-buy-jump-123700224.html,1685104620,STORY,"['CAG', 'MKC', 'KHC', 'LW', 'MKC-V']","[High commodity prices and higher borrowing costs have compelled people to cut down on spending. This has been severely impacting the manufacturing sector, which has been shrinking as demand is drying up. Also, the retail sector has been suffering as consumers are spending cautiously.However, it is almost impossible to cut down on spending on basic necessities like daily-need items and groceries. This has seen online grocery sales grow steadily amid inflationary pressures. Groceries belong to the consumer staples sector, and investing in such stocks is safe during this time of economic uncertainty.Online Grocery Sales GrowAccording to the latest Brick Meets Click/Mercatus Shopping Survey, online grocery sales increased 1% year over year in April. Online grocery sales totaled $8.2 billion. The jump comes despite a decline in pickup and ship-to-home sales.Pickup declined 3%, while ship-to-home sales dropped 19%. However, delivery sales soared 20% in April.The gains in delivery sales in April were driven by a solid jump in monthly active users and higher average order value (AOV).This means an increasing number of people are opting to buy groceries online. At the same time, demand is still high, which is boosting orders.  AOV rose 5% year over year in April.Another reason for the jump in April is a low unemployment rate and steady growth in wages. Higher wages are helping consumers with more purchasing power. Also, solid job additions to the economy in April helped boost grocery sales. The U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs in April.Inflation, although at a multi-year high, showed signs of easing in April. The consumer price index (CPI) showed that consumer prices rose 4.9% year over year in April compared to 5% in March. This is the lowest annual rate since April 2021.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in grocery stocks with a strong online presence. Also, groceries belong to the consumer staples sector, which is defensive in nature. These stocks are fundamentally sound given that consumer demand for staples like groceries typically remains resilient to wild swings in the economic cycle.Story continuesOur PicksGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in these four food and grocery stocks.

143,d0bcb5eb-76f8-3bae-bbab-2f662e490aab,TGT,2023-05-27,"Retail: Theft hurting big names like Ulta, Target",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/retail-analyst-examines-costco-store-142051523.html,1685110851,VIDEO,"['TGT', 'COST', 'WMT', 'ULTA', 'LVMHF', 'LVMUY']","[Cowen Senior Research Analyst Oliver Chen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest from the retail sector, including Costco's declining sales, the outlook for luxury brands like LVMH, and how theft is hurting big names like Target and Ulta.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, let's talk about another fly-in-the-ointment perhaps-- the consumer spending story. It stays in focus with results from Costco, the warehouse chain, showing it is not immune to choosier shoppers who bought fewer bulk items last quarter. Same store sales growth slowed. Back in February, CFO Richard Galanti warned investors over weakness in big ticket discretionary items, and this is a theme that we have seen across the sector in the last few weeks.Joining us now, Oliver Chen, Cowen senior research analyst. Oliver, good morning. What a pleasure to see you here this morning. Let's talk about Costco a little bit here because we did have in particular the US comparable sales excluding fuel that did not rise as much as estimated. What's going on here? One would think that Costco could do well in this environment.OLIVER CHEN: Julie, great being here. Happy holidays as well. So at Costco we are really excited about the continuation of exceptional value, high quality. What's really distinguished here is traffic continues to be positive at 3.5%. But what you brought up earlier, Julie, big ticket items, big and bulky home electronics, that's been a tougher negative category, and that's particularly vulnerable online as about half of those items are big and bulky.On the other hand, food, essentials, that's working really well at Costco. We continue to love it as our top idea, Costco at large. It's actually a very simple model. In many ways it's not even a retailer. It's a membership model. And all customers are looking for value. So structurally, it's one of the best merchants in the industry. And this is one of America's few exports globally in terms of retail.Story continuesOne of the big facts of Costco is they only have 3,500 to 4,000 SKUs. That compares to 200,000 plus at Walmart. Having that assortment is quite powerful, and everybody likes the Kirkland brand. That's about 30% of the business mix. That's compelling too, having that unique private label.DIANE KING HALL: So Oliver, I got to ask you-- Diane here. So you say continues to be one of your top ideas. You also cover Walmart, so how does this compare to a Walmart? You would think that you would see kind of similar strength in Costco compared to Walmart, but it looks different to me. What's your assessment?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, at Walmart we're also excited by the momentum in grocery. Walmart is the US's leading grocer. It's about 60% grocery. That's a key positive. But as you think about Walmart, we think about a retail ecosystem, which means digital advertising, financial services, health and wellness. The GLP-1 drugs also helped Walmart's numbers too.Walmart offers everyday low value. That's a core theme at Costco as well. Costco has a higher income customer. But what's happening at Walmart with curbside pickup, with the American Express deals, with Walmart Plus, they're also attracting higher income customers too. But as you know, 90% of America is within 10 miles of a Walmart, so it's very much America in terms of who it broadcasts to.But as we think about Costco, it's a core membership model with a very fixed quantitative low markup, so you really can't get a better deal. As you think about Walmart, you think about a company that's bricks, clicks, and portals as well as a broader technology company with a very well-run grocery system as well. So we like that. And then bigger picture thematically for investors, we like what we call the bow tie thesis. So own LVMH and luxury as well as own deep value.JULIE HYMAN: Speaking of which, you should be wearing a bow tie today for your theme, Oliver as you have I think on occasion. I am interested in that thesis, and I'm interested in what you have to say about luxury. but I got to ask you about something else first, and that is, quote unquote, shrink, the theft that we have been hearing about time and time again during this earnings season. Ulta was the most recent that talked about it, but we heard it from Dollar Tree, we heard it from Target as well. What is going on in retail America, and why does it seem like the retailers are having so much trouble stopping it?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, unfortunately it's been worse than expected. So as we look ahead, the plan is for more labor as well as working on fixture. And this was a big charge at Target. It was $500 million. It also led to impact of Ulta's SG&amp;A margins. So the impact is very real.What really needs to happen is collaboration across the government, companies, society, products. Collaboration likely needs to happen. I don't think there's an easy solution to this, and it continues to evolve. But unfortunately it's gotten worse, and it's been quite material in terms of the margins and what stores have to do largely in terms of investing in additional labor.DIANE KING HALL: And of course, Oliver, to your point also about, say, Target's hit from this issue, Ulta has prominent placement in Target. Let's widen out in terms of Ulta. What was your overall assessment of their results this latest quarter?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah, we've loved Ulta as a long-term idea. What we have been cautious about is peakish margins because this company has performed great. Investing in your face, wellness, that's been a long-term trend. Also cosmetics and skincare are doing great. That being said, last night was tough with the margin profile.As you mentioned, Diane, thinking about the shrink and what it did to operating margins, that was a negative. Also we're starting to see an uptick in promotions. That's also not good too in terms of thinking about the margins. And this is also a story of a company that's continued to hold on to great gains throughout the pandemic as people really think about self-care. So we're encouraged for the long term.But what happened in terms of expectations being very high, peakish operating margins running at 14% to 15%, as well as an attractive valuation, that caused some caution into the print in terms of how they printed relative to expectations. It's the Home Depot for women. It's a unique concept. They have a very good loyalty program.You know, as we think about loyalty, artificial intelligence intersects very strongly with loyalty and really how much data you collect. Augmented reality is actually working in beauty as you sample different shades online as well, so we're excited about that sector at large. And the consumer puts wellness as well as beauty together. And also as we think about Gen Z, it's a very ethnic sector-- a very ethnic population. So beauty plays well into what's happening with the beauty enthusiast as well as social media.JULIE HYMAN: And Oliver-- by the way I love that Home Depot for women analogy.DIANE KING HALL: So did I.JULIE HYMAN: Let's get to the bow tie and, in particular, the fancy part, I guess, of the bow tie or what some people would call a barbell approach, the LVMH and Richemonts of the world. LVMH, such an interesting story because, of course, became the first European company to top $500 billion in market cap, but it's well below that now because of the recent route in the shares due to concerns over growth in China. Is that something that you're concerned about? Can it reattain that $500 billion in pretty short order, do you think?OLIVER CHEN: Yeah. Health care has the number one biotech expert and health care team. We just had [INAUDIBLE] on very moments ago. The XBB variant is happening in China now, but we don't expect closures actually. So the stock's had a shock last week, but this could be a great buying opportunity.LVMH is our top European idea. You know, you've known me for a long time, Julie. We've loved LVMH for many years. It has $10 billion of marketing spend. It's the biggest market cap company in Europe. Having that much marketing spend combined with power brands-- the Louis Vuitton brand runs at a 40% plus margin. You get Sephora which is a premier beauty retailer, and you also get Dior as well as Tiffany.So you're getting a broad array of power brands that have reached extreme tipping points where they can spend a lot on advertising and promotion. And we've seen attractive price leverage at the high end as consumers go out again and as the Louis Vuitton and Dior brands just continue to reinvent themselves with lots of innovation. Our new creative artist Pharrell Williams joined LV as well. So all those things have-- lead to sustainable long-term growth. And he's doing a great job managing capital.In many ways, LVMH is an asset manager of a portfolio of brands for the very long term. We're excited about that. And as we think bigger picture, the Chinese consumer, the emerging market there, it's a big important driver given that it's about 25% to 30% of revenues and 30% to 50% of growth contribution longer term. But again, at the high end, that customer is very strong. We're worried about what we call the aspirational consumer, the more entry level luxury consumer. We've seen cracks there, and that's been true in the US as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, that makes sense if we're getting all the recession talk that we have been. Oliver, always great to get your perspective. A lot of different tickers and stocks for people to keep an eye on in that discussion. Oliver Chen is Cowen senior research analyst. Thanks.OLIVER CHEN: Pleasure being here. Thank you.]"

(ISRG) closed at $306.90 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.03% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.31%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.19%.Coming into today, shares of the company had gained 2.65% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 3.67%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.12%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Intuitive Surgical, Inc. to post earnings of $1.32 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 15.79%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.73 billion, up 13.71% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.46 per share and revenue of $7.11 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.67% and +14.31%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.73% lower. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 55.6.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Intuitive Surgical, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 13%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.9% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Intuitive Surgical compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Intuitive Surgical here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Intuitive Surgical, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 20% over the last five years. However it looks like Intuitive Surgical might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Intuitive Surgical's ROCETo conclude, we've found that Intuitive Surgical is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 98% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.While Intuitive Surgical doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

Shares have lost about 8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Navient due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Navient Q1 Earnings &amp; NII Top Estimates, Provisions DipNavient reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.06, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. The reported figure compares favorably with the year-ago quarter’s 90 cents.A fall in core NII and total other income has hindered the results. Nonetheless, a decrease in expenses was a tailwind.Navient’s GAAP net income was $111 million, down from $255 million in the prior-year quarter.NII &amp; Expenses DecreaseCore NII declined 8.3% year over year to $253 million in the first quarter but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $230.6 million.Total other income plunged 61% to $88 million. The downside stemmed from a decrease in all components.Provision for loan losses was a benefit of $1 million against expenses of $16 million in the prior-year quarter.Total expenses decreased 9% year over year to $192 million.Quarterly Performance of SegmentsFederal Education Loans: The segment generated a net income of $87 million, down year over year from $107 million.As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s net FFELP loans were $42.14 billion, down 3.2% sequentially.Consumer Lending: The segment reported a net income of $110 million, which increased from $79 million in the year-ago quarter.

In addition, Navient originated $135 million of private education refinance loans in the reported quarter.Business Processing: The segment reported a net income of $4 million, plunging from $14 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesLiquidityIn order to meet liquidity needs, Navient expects to utilize various sources, including cash and investment portfolio, the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities, the repayment of principal on unencumbered student-loan assets, and distributions from securitization trusts. It may also draw down on the secured FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan facilities, issue term asset-backed securities (ABS), enter additional Private Education Loan and ABS repurchase facilities or issue additional unsecured debt.Notably, it had $570 million of total unrestricted cash and liquid investments as of Mar 31, 2023.Capital Deployment ActivitiesIn the first quarter, the company paid out $21 million in common stock dividends. In the reported quarter, Navient repurchased shares of common stock for $85 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, there was $515 million of the remaining share-repurchase authority.2023 OutlookAdjusted core EPS (excluding restructuring and regulatory charges) is expected to be $3.15-$3.30.Core earnings ROE is expected in the mid-teens range. The core earnings efficiency ratio is projected to be 55-58%.Management expects the adjusted tangible equity ratio to be 8-9%.For the Federal Education Loan segment, the company anticipates NIM of 1-1.1% and the charge-off rate to be 0.10-0.20%.For the Consumer Lending segment, management estimates a NIM of 2.80-2.90%. The charge-off rate is expected to be 1.5-2%.Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin for the Business Processing segment is projected in the high-teens.Management estimates to repurchase shares aggregating $225 million for the remaining three quarters of 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Navient has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookNavient has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNavient is part of the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry. Over the past month, Ally Financial (ALLY), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.Ally Financial reported revenues of $2.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.6%.

150,63d48afb-7ecb-3553-adac-8e16efe80277,RCL,2023-05-27,Carnival Cruise Line has 'the longest way to go' in travel rebound,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/carnival-cruise-line-longest-way-201246626.html,1685131966,VIDEO,"['CCL', 'CUK', 'CUKPF', 'RCL', 'SIX', 'NCLH']","[Citi Leisure &amp; Travel Analyst James Hardiman joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Carnival Corp's latest stock upgrade, the state of cruise lines as travel demand is expected to rebound this summer, and examines the state of the consumer through the lens of experiential spending.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, we are sticking with a travel theme going into Memorial Day weekend. But we're now focusing on your investments. Citigroup raising Carnival to buy from a neutral and lifting its price target to $14, saying the cruise industry is seeing positive momentum, and it is not slowing down.Joining us now, we've got the analyst behind the call, Citi Leisure and Travel analyst James Hardiman. James, good to talk to you today. We talk about the call that you made here, upping your price target from 10 to 14. But specifically, you've said pandemic tailwinds to the cruise industry are greater than any macro headwinds. Talk to me about what you're seeing.JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I think that's right. While so much of the economy over the last few years was emerging from this pandemic, I mean, the cruise industry was laid up for an extended period of time. We call this the last remaining reopening story.And it really wasn't until the fall really, almost into the wintertime last year, where the final COVID restrictions were lifted. You know, I think people were not only worried about getting COVID on these cruise ships, but I think more importantly, they were worried about getting stuck, right, and all of the sort of testing requirements that went into not only getting on the ship, but getting off the ship.And so if I think about what's happened since that time, you know, and all the data that we look at in terms of both pricing and booking activity, we think that was a turning point and that things really picked up since then and carried through into this year's wave season. The wave season is the first three months of the year, where a disproportionate number of the bookings take place. And by all accounts, it's been an excellent wave season.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: James, give us a better sense of that pricing and the traffic that you just mentioned there, how that compares to 2019 levels pre-pandemic?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, it's a great question. So from a booking perspective, we're finally starting to comp favorably to 2019, where we're sort of at the higher end of historical booking levels. Pricing, we think about is more of an opportunity than anything. By our numbers, we think cruise ticket pricing specifically on board is much higher. But cruise ticket pricing is only up a couple of per cent in aggregate for the industry versus 2019. And of all of the cruise companies, Carnival is the biggest laggard here.We're starting to see that inflect positively. And we think that's a big opportunity. Effectively, this is an industry that was sitting on the sidelines for three years while everything else in consumer were driving prices higher and higher and higher. And so on a relative basis, I think a lot of consumers are going to look at cruise travel and say to themselves, you know, my dollars aren't going as far as they used to. This is a bargain for all intents and purposes.AKIKO FUJITA: And that's exactly my question, James, because I'm thinking back to 2019 pre-pandemic. This is an industry that had a lot of loyal customers, but very specific customers, right? When you think about the momentum that we're seeing right now, is this about that same group returning or are a lot of these cruise liners are companies bringing new travelers into the fold?JAMES HARDIMAN: I think it's both, I think early on in the restart. So if we were to rewind a year ago, call it maybe even a little bit more, it was all about, you know, people that were regular cruisers and that had missed a trip or two, right, and they were sort of making up for lost time.I think in the last 6 to 9 months, we've seen the new to cruise segment really come back in full force. And most of these cruise companies are now saying that the new to cruise portion of the mix is similar, in some cases better than it was in 2019, which I think speaks volumes.SEANA SMITH: James, are you seeing any signs of the consumers trading down and opting for maybe some of the cheaper options that the cruise lines are offering?JAMES HARDIMAN: It's a great question. We're not seeing that per se. I would tell you that what we are seeing, and I think this feeds into to yesterday's upgrade to a certain degree, is that the premium offerings, right, the higher end, more expensive offerings were early on doing well. We're outperforming in a meaningful way.Fast forward to today, and we're starting to see some of the more, they call it contemporary in the cruise space, but maybe a little more value-focused offerings, playing catch up. And so on a year over year basis, Carnival, the brand Carnival, not the company, but the Carnival brand based on a lot of the pricing data that we look at is the best performing brand in the industry right now, on a year over year basis. Some of that is ultimately playing catch up. But we'll take it nonethelessAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. And so as you look at the other names in the space, I mean, clearly you've given an upgrade to Carnival. You like what you see there. But are they best positioned to maintain or at least take more market share and be able to benefit from the momentum we're seeing right now?JAMES HARDIMAN: Yeah, I think the way that Carnival has the most juice for sure. And some of that is that they've got more distance to go. Long before the pandemic started, I think a lot of Carnival's brands-- and to give you an idea, the Carnival proper, right, the namesake brand is their biggest, but it's far from their only brand. They have nine different brands. Princess is another big one. Costa is another big one. Those are the three biggest brands for Carnival.I think there have been challenges for all three of those brands. There have been some missteps along the way. There's been some really bad luck along the way. But I think there's the opportunity. And so much of this upgrade, that Carnival has a newsy, newish CEO. He's been there for about a year now. I think there's a huge opportunity for Josh Weinstein to start to, you know, turn this ship around, so to speak.SEANA SMITH: James, we talk about a lot, the consumers are focused on experiences. And I know you cover Six Flags. How are regional theme parks positioned in the event of a downturn or in a time when some consumers are looking to save a little bit of money and not splurging for that vacation?JAMES HARDIMAN: It's a great question. And even coming into last year, as people started to have concerns about the macro environment, the theme park space was our sort of top industry pick because historically they have been trade down beneficiaries.I think last year, if you think about what we saw in the broader economy, the broader consumer sector. We saw a lot of those low end consumers fall out of the bottom end. But we didn't see sort of that trade down piece, right? The higher end consumers that are opting not to go to, you know, Florida or Mexico or Europe.The hope is that we begin to see that favorable offset here in 2023. But I would tell you so far. I mean, most of the industry data that we've looked at has been somewhat disappointing thus far. So, you know, when I think about the cruise industry, it's the one sector that I cover and really more broadly across consumers. Hard to say-- to say the following about a whole lot of sectors. And that's that, you know, a recession would be an improvement for the cruise space versus where they've been the last few years.And I have a high degree of confidence that 2023 is going to be better than '22, and that '24 is going to be better than '23. You can't say that about a whole lot of sectors right now.AKIKO FUJITA: James Hardiman, Citi analyst, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

This compares with 48% of guests reported in 2019. The company stated that every dollar of pre-cruse spending translates into approximately $0.70 of incremental spend (on board). Secular tailwinds, courtesy of shifting of consumer preferences from goods to entertainment and travel spending (24% higher than 2019 levels) added to the positives. The company emphasizes on enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing its distribution channels to boost guest repeat rates and spending.Royal Caribbean witnesses better-than-expected booking volumes in first-quarter 2023, which were much higher than the 2019 levels. As of Mar 31, 2023, North America-based sailings portrayed robust booking trends, accounting for nearly 76% of the company’s capacity. RCL registered better-than-expected load factors, owing to a rise in close-in bookings.

As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had about $5.27 billion in customer deposits.Story continuesGiven the full fleet resumption and load factors at high prices (at approximately 102%), the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods. In 2023, the company anticipates solid guest generation from the North America region.The company focuses on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offering and deliver superior yields and margins. Moving into 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2023 According to Billionaire Rajiv Jain. Bloomberg reported on May 23 that Rajiv Jain, the billionaire CEO of GQG Partners, has increased his investment in Gautam Adani's conglomerate by approximately 10% and plans to participate in the conglomerate's upcoming fundraising efforts. This decision reflects Jain's strong belief in the outstanding infrastructure assets present in India, which he considers to be the finest available. The billionaire noted that GQG's investments in Adani were valued at approximately $3.5 billion. Jain stated in an interview with Bloomberg:“Within five years, we would like to be one of the largest investors in Adani Group depending on the valuation, after the family. We would certainly want to be partners in any of Adani Group’s new offerings.”Bloomberg mentioned that GQG purchased shares worth nearly $2 billion from a family trust during March, investing in four of Adani's companies. This initial investment provided support to the struggling conglomerate after facing allegations of stock-price manipulation and corporate fraud from Hindenburg Research, a New York-based short-seller. As a result of these accusations, the Adani Group experienced a significant decline in market value, losing over $150 billion at one point.Jain expressed his lack of concern regarding the allegations made by the short seller, which Adani has consistently denied. He characterized these accusations as commonplace in the business environment of India. Earlier this year, in an interview with Bloomberg News, Jain stated that throughout his 30-year investment career, he had not yet encountered a perfect company. He justified his counterintuitive investment by highlighting the value of Adani Group's businesses, such as its coal mining and airport assets, which align with India's development objectives. Story continuesRajiv Jain was quoted by Financial Times in April 2023, when the billionaire further explained his investment decision in Adani Group. He said: “Is this perfectly clean? No, it’s not. Is it fraud? No, it’s not. So the difference between the two is what we’re talking about. In the meantime, you are getting irreplaceable assets, at very attractive valuations, which have some tremendous upside.”During the first three months of 2023, Rajiv Jain's $38.2 billion investment portfolio consisted of several prominent growth stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). In this article, we discuss Jain's top growth plays. Our Methodology This list comprises growth stocks that Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held during the first quarter of 2023. By growth stocks we mean companies operating in growth-oriented industries such as tech, electric vehicles, fintech, ecommerce, biotech and healthcare, and renewable energy. The list is ranked in ascending order based on the percentage of stake held by the hedge fund. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around the securities as of Q1 2023. 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2023 According to Billionaire Rajiv Jain Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2023 According to Billionaire Rajiv Jain12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $557,100,891 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) functions as a diversified software firm on a global scale. Its operations are divided into three segments - Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. In Q1 2023, Rajiv Jain added Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) to his portfolio by purchasing 1.4 million shares of the company worth $557 million. It is one of the top growth stocks in the billionaire's portfolio.On March 28, Erste Group analyst Hans Engel raised the rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Hold to Buy. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has provided a positive outlook for revenue and profit growth in the current fiscal year. Despite having higher return on equity and operating margin compared to its peers, the stock is valued at a significantly lower level than the average of its peer group, according to the analyst's assessment.According to Insider Monkey's first quarter database, 99 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group held the largest stake in the company.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $627,294,285Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. It is divided into four segments – Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments.

The analyst explained that the company's Q2 guidance is not as strong and their increasing investments in AI are raising concerns for the firm. Despite this, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 97 funds in the earlier quarter.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN),  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best growth stocks to invest in according to billionaire Rajiv Jain. White Falcon Capital Management made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”10. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $713,866,616Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a global provider of cloud computing solutions for enterprises. The company’s offerings encompass the organization, structuring, consolidation, management, and automation of services for businesses on a large scale. In Q1 2023, Rajiv Jain boosted his position in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) a dramatic 63534%, holding 1.5 million shares worth $713.8 million.

(NYSE:NOW) from $551 to $559 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm suggests that investors should reconsider their perspective on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) after the analyst day. During the event, the management provided a compelling explanation of how the company will capitalize on the advancements in artificial intelligence. The new long-term targets presented by the company align closely with the consensus expectations, which eliminates any negative impact on the stock, according to Barclays’ research note.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 96 hedge funds were bullish on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), compared to 97 funds in the last quarter. Christopher Lyle’s SCGE Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company. Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”9. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $830,812,854Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 220Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a new arrival in Rajiv Jain’s GQG portfolio in Q1 2023. The billionaire acquired 3.92 million shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) worth $830.8 million, representing 2.17% of the total 13F portfolio. It is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2023 according to Rajiv Jain. On April 26, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported Q1 GAAP earnings per share of $2.20 and a revenue of $28.65 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.23 and $990 million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2023, Meta's Family of Apps segment witnessed a 26% year-over-year growth in ad impressions, while the average price per ad experienced a 17% year-over-year decline. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2023, the company anticipates total revenue to fall within the range of $29.5 billion to $32 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $29.47 billion.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 220 hedge funds were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), up from 194 funds in the earlier quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 7.71 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Our top contributors in Q1 were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) and FedEx. Following sharp declines in 2022, shares of Meta Platforms have more than doubled since their early November 2022 lows. Last year’s drawdown created a highly favorable risk-reward, which we took advantage of by adding to our position. Management has wisely, in our view, recalibrated its spending plans to focus on profitability amid a weaker advertising environment, increased TikTok competition and Apple’s privacy changes. While investors got ahead of themselves back in 2021, extrapolating pandemic growth rates into the future, Meta is still a highly successful enterprise generating over $120 billion of revenue annually on a run-rate basis and has more than $40 billion in cash on its balance sheet to help it navigate its future course. Recent usage and engagement trends for Facebook and Instagram have been positive, and Reels—Meta’s answer to TikTok—is gaining traction.”8. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,022,292,338Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is engaged in the discovery, development, and distribution of human pharmaceuticals worldwide.

Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a significant position holder in the company. Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is likely to be approved for obesity in 2023. Lilly has two new obesity drugs advancing into Phase 3 trials. Lilly also has a drug in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations, and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”7. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,183,340,369Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 173Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of the best growth stocks to invest in according to GQG Partners’ Rajiv Jain. In the first quarter of 2023, Jain increased his holdings in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) by 32%. He owns 5.2 million shares of the company as of March 31, valued at $1.18 billion, which accounts for approximately 3.09% of his total 13F portfolio.On April 25, Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V), compared to 177 funds in the preceding quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 19.3 million shares worth $4.3 billion.Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of ecommerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”6. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)GQG Partners’ Stake Value: $1,244,489,042Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 289Rajiv Jain has included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in his portfolio consistently since the fourth quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2023, Jain significantly increased his investment in Microsoft, raising his stake by 643%. He now holds 4.3 million shares of the company as of March, valued at $1.24 billion, which accounts for approximately 3.25% of his overall portfolio.On May 11, Wedbush increased its price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) from $325 to $340 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm's positive stance is driven by stable cloud deal flow and the potential for monetization through artificial intelligence. Wedbush emphasized that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is firmly listed as one of its Best Ideas. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 289 hedge funds were bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), compared to 259 funds in the prior quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $11.3 billion. Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the top growth stock picks of Rajiv Jain. Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft’s CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services. Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows Devices, Gaming, and Search). While the company reported decent fiscal second quarter results, their investment in OpenAl’s ChatGPT captured the attention of investors. contributing to positive performance. Throughout the quarter. Microsoft surprised investors with continual rollouts of new Al capabilities across the company’s portfolio (e.g., Bing, GitHub. Teams, Office 365). Furthermore, the company announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which leverages GPT-4, a large language model, combined with the Microsoft Graph of data to provide Al virtual assistance. We believe Microsoft’s investment in OpenAl provides a first-mover advantage in the Al transformer model space. Despite challenges in the early days of Al-powered applications, the pace of Al innovation is faster than any other enterprise technology previously observed, in our view.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2023 According to Billionaire Rajiv Jain.  Suggested articles:How to Become a Millionaire by Age 30: 12 Tips from ExpertsBill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksBillionaire John Paulson’s 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks Disclosure: None. 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2023 According to Billionaire Rajiv Jain is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(V) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-attracting-investor-130013529.html,1685106013,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned -2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has lost 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.4%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $32.51 billion and $35.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.9% and +10.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The plan builds on Verizon’s long-term commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by addressing four key drivers of the marketing value chain, both within Verizon and with its partners:Increasing diversity and equity in both representation and economic investment across the creative supply chainContinuing to build an inclusive environment for talent that reflects the communities we serveStrengthening practices aimed at fighting bias and stereotypes in all advertising, content, and mediaMaintaining the gold standard of brand safety, with content policies that prohibit Verizon creative from being placed or run in broadcast and digital environments where hateful, denigrating, discriminatory and other types of harmful content appear.For the second year in a row, Verizon exceeded all of the goals laid out by the Responsible Marketing Action Plan and is maintaining accountability by transparently reporting its results. The company is also adding new targets to continue expanding the plan’s reach, demonstrating how brands can leverage their investments and ability to shape cultural norms to drive lasting change.“This progress is part of Verizon’s company-wide commitment to responsible business practices. As one of the most influential advertisers in the country, we embrace our leadership role in driving action around equity,” said Diego Scotti, Chief Marketing Officer at Verizon. “Verizon and our partners have delivered strong, consistent results and will continue to push for greater accountability. I encourage other brands to join us in this effort. To build momentum, you have to take the first step. Together, we have the power to make an even bigger impact.”Story continuesVerizon put a stake in the ground in 2016 with a call for agency partners to take action to support diversity on the teams that support the Verizon business. Since then, Verizon’s DE&amp;I Agency Council, made up of senior agency team leads from Interpublic Group (IPG), Publicis, and WPP, has been meeting quarterly to read out on progress and ensure accountability and transparency. These discussions have led to a number of ongoing initiatives to address shared challenges, including the creation of adfellows, a first-of-its-kind paid fellowship designed to break through the diversity and inclusion gap in advertising and marketing by providing the next generation of diverse entry-level talent with meaningful job experience and career acceleration opportunities. This was later followed by the creation of Ad Disruptors, a program aimed at leadership development and retention of mid-level diverse talent.In 2017, Verizon unveiled the first of its kind “Responsible Marketing Policy” that set a gold standard for brand safety and remains one of the strongest criteria in digital advertising.Then in 2021, Verizon further built on this commitment with the creation of the Responsible Marketing Action Plan, and each year the company has adjusted targets and added new parameters to continue broadening the plan’s holistic impact.As evidence of the plan’s ability to drive meaningful progress, Verizon’s combined marketing and external agency staff is represented by 40.8% people of color, which is a 1.5 percent point increase since 2021. The ethnic diversity on Verizon’s marketing team is almost on par with the most recent US Census report, and is significantly above the Association of National Advertisers’ average for marketing organizations at 32.3% according to the 2022 Association of National Advertisers Diversity Report for the Marketing and Advertising Industry. Verizon also exceeded the 2022 telecommunications industry benchmark for SeeHer’s Gender Equity Measure (GEM) by seven points.The 2022 Responsible Marketing Action Plan results include:Increase diversity and equity in both representation and economic investment across the creative supply chain: Verizon set a goal to spend 40% of its video, experiential, and print production budget with diverse companies in 2022. The company exceeded that goal across all formats:Video: Verizon spent 45.7% with diverse-owned video production companies; additionally, 44.4% of video productions used diverse directors.Experiential: The company spent 42.6% with diverse-owned experiential production companies.Print: The company spent 41.5% with diverse-owned print production companies.Build an inclusive work environment for talent that reflects the communities we serve:Verizon made continued progress in its efforts to build diverse teams and foster an inclusive work environment for talent. By the end of 2022:People of color made up 40.8% of the combined Verizon marketing and agency team, an increase from 39.3% at year-end 2021. The 2022 Association of National Advertisers Diversity Report for the Marketing and Advertising Industry set the industry benchmark at 32.3%.Women made up 56.9% of the combined Verizon marketing and agency teams, an increase from 51.7% at year-end 2021.Fight bias in advertising, content and media: As part of Verizon’s ongoing efforts to keep its creative free from racism, bias, and stereotypes, 100% of Verizon’s advertising goes through gender and cultural bias testing. Using SeeHer’s Gender Equity Measure (GEM), a research methodology that quantifies gender bias, Verizon achieved a GEM score of 99 for the first half of 2022 – seven points above the telecom benchmark.Verizon also uses Diversity Inclusion &amp; Equity Measure (DIEM), a proprietary tool that vets the representation of race, gender, ethnicity and identity. DIEM provides a two-pronged approach to identifying cultural impact in advertising by providing pre-market measurements that optimize ads prior to launch, as well as in-market measurements that track progress over time, in an effort to ensure consumers are portrayed authentically and respectfully.In addition, all Verizon marketers and agency partners are required to complete agency anti-racism and bias training to help identify bias throughout the creative process from research to production. Verizon will continue to require this training bi-annually.Responsible Content Policies: Through Verizon’s continued participation with the World Federation of Advertisers’ Global Alliance for Responsible Media, the company received a 99.1% rating within the Integral Ad Science Brand Safety measure that counts the percentage of media placements that do not violate the brand safety threshold. Verizon aims to achieve a 99% rating or higher annually.New Initiatives for 2023: Increase sustainable production: 100% of Verizon’s video production and experiential events will execute a waste management diversion plan with the goal of increasing asset reuse (donation, recycling, upcycling) and creating a more sustainable approach to video production.Support a diverse range of brand ambassadors and influencers: Verizon seeks to have a diverse range of influencers, creators and ambassadors who reflect the communities the company serves, and will begin tracking these relationships to assess diversity.To help other companies implement the responsible marketing practices outlined in their plan, Verizon created the Responsible Marketing Action Blueprint, a set of free online tools that packages together the learnings from Verizon’s work around DE&amp;I, to help other marketers identify where they can make an impact and take measurable actions to get there.Verizon’s commitment to responsible marketing is part of Citizen Verizon: the company’s responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement that leverages technology, innovation, and people to help solve some of the biggest challenges impacting underrepresented populations, through the pillars of climate protection, human prosperity, and digital inclusion.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $136.8 billion in 2022.

(NYSE:TPR) Shares Could Be 37% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestry-inc-nyse-tpr-shares-134709464.html,1685108829,STORY,['TPR'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Tapestry fair value estimate is US$64.65Current share price of US$40.70 suggests Tapestry is potentially 37% undervalued Analyst price target for TPR is US$51.00 which is 21% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$781.1mUS$1.02bUS$1.05bUS$1.17bUS$1.23bUS$1.28bUS$1.33bUS$1.37bUS$1.40bUS$1.44bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 4.07%Est @ 3.48%Est @ 3.07%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.6% US$712US$845US$794US$807US$777US$737US$696US$654US$613US$574(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.2bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.6%– 2.1%) = US$20bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b÷ ( 1 + 9.6%)10= US$7.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$15b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$40.7, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tapestry as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.268. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TapestryStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

168,085329c3-8cab-3a69-beb5-ed0e16e09faf,NVDA,2023-05-27,Q1 Earnings: Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) Sustain Momentum?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-earnings-artificial-intelligence-ai-215000951.html,1685137800,STORY,"['NVDA', '^GSPC', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']","[The analysts covering Nvidia NVDA are struggling to come up with superlatives to describe the chipmaker’s blockbuster quarterly results. Coming into Nvidia’s May 26th quarterly numbers, many analysts saw some upside to consensus estimates, given the company’s AI leverage. But the stock had already doubled this year before the Wednesday release on those AI hopes.It is humbling to acknowledge that I thought the stock was ‘priced for perfection’ and was skeptical that Nvidia could do anything in the quarterly numbers that could satisfy those lofty expectations. Keep in mind that we fall in the Nvidia ‘fan club,’ having held the stock in the Zacks Focus List portfolio since May 2019.The stock’s performance since the quarterly release is in a class of its own, and for good reasons. In the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, Nvidia raised Q2 revenue guidance by more than +50% on the back of robust data-center demand reflecting momentum in generative AI and large language models. Importantly, Nvidia indicated a high degree of visibility in these demand trends over the coming quarters.There are legitimate questions as to how sustainable this growth trajectory will prove to be and whether Nvidia will be able to protect its first-mover advantage as the competitive landscape heats up over time.We have all glimpsed the potential of generative AI by playing around with ChatGPT and Google Bard, allowing us to envision this technology’s ability to enhance efficiencies. But it is reasonable to be skeptical of both the trillions of dollars in TAMs that the AI revolution will unleash or the emerging talk of an ‘AI bubble.’Nvidia is hardly alone in riding the AI wave, with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL already duking it out for primacy. Alphabet’s earlier AI efforts didn’t impress the market much, and many had started thinking that Microsoft may be able to leverage AI to open up Alphabet’s hold on the search market. But Alphabet appears to have found its mojo back, as the stock’s recent performance shows.Story continuesThe chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe earnings outlook for the ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ that includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta META, in addition to Microsoft and Alphabet, has steadily improved lately. Total Q1 earnings for the group were essentially flat (down -0.4%) on +4.3% higher revenues.The growth outlook starts improving from the current period (2023 Q2) onwards, with earnings expected to be up +8.9% on +4.9% higher revenues.The chart below shows the group’s earnings picture on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the group’s earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 26th, we now have Q1 earnings from 486 S&amp;P 500 members, or 97.2% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.7% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 75.1% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63.2%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad, either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears warned us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 100 companies on deck to report results, including 9 S&amp;P 500 members. This week’s docket includes Salesforce.com, Macy’s, Broadcom, Lululemon, Dollar General, and others.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of companies in other recent periods.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the companies that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Earnings Outlook Reflects Stability  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In order to skip our detailed ranking and jump directly to the top shows on Hulu currently, go to 10 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 2023.Over the last few decades, television (TV) has changed from being a luxury to a standard feature in households. In 2022, the total global revenue attributed to the television industry amounted to $93.76 billion. While TV remains a key feature in our daily lives, rapid technological changes are taking place in the industry as well with multiple new technologies capturing the market, specifically in the digital space. Cable TV is experiencing stagnation, and the subscription-based, video-on-demand model is growing in popularity.Subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) is a model in which users pay a monthly or annual fee in exchange for receiving service streaming access for that time to an online library of movies, TV shows, and other content. Projections on Statista indicate that the number of subscription video-on-demand model subscribers will rise above 1.6 billion in 2027. It stood at 1.2 billion in 2021. SVOD revenue in the United States is likely to cross $95 billion in 2023, whereas it is estimated to reach around $160 billion worldwide in the same year. This revenue is expected to further grow globally at an annual rate of 9.71%, which is projected to raise the market volume to $230 billion by 2027.The SVOD industry continues to remain competitive. Major players in the market include Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, YouTube Premium, Hotstar, and HBO to name a few.The focus of this article is on the 25 best TV shows on Hulu in 2023. Hulu, which was launched in October 2007, is an American subscription-based streaming service. It is owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) holding a minority stake through NBCUniversal. It started off as a joint venture initially between New Corporation and NBC Universal, and later The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). That helped the platform gain access to television series of all these broadcasting companies. Hulu’s subscription service started in 2010 with the launch of Hulu Plus. It featured un-delayed access to television series of different partner companies. Story continuesHulu currently has over 48 million subscribers who have access to Hulu’s library, offering them to watch a wide range of movies and television series produced by Hulu’s original programming, as well as companies such as 20th Century Studios, ABC, and Disney Television Studios (NYSE:DIS). In 2016, Hulu announced to devote itself entirely to the subscription model and discontinue its on-demand video service by syndicating it to Yahoo! Screen. In 2017, Hulu inaugurated an over-the-top live TV service.2023 has been a promising year for Hulu in terms of numbers and recognition. In the first quarter of the fiscal year, the company had an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $92.32. It was nominated for 10 awards at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards, winning three. Several new TV shows have been released this year and existing shows are being renewed for a new season. At the same time, there are shows that were released decades ago but remain popular among the viewers, such as General Hospital (1963), M*A*S*H (1972), Full House (1987), Rugrats (1991), The X-Files (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Futurama (1999), Freaks and Geeks (1999), and others.Below is the list of trending shows on Hulu which you should not miss out on this year.25 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 2023Photo by Tech Daily on UnsplashMethodologyConsensus method has been used to rank the 25 best TV shows to watch on Hulu in 2023.

(AP) — Disney is opposing a request by Gov. Ron DeSantis to disqualify a judge overseeing the company's First Amendment lawsuit against the Florida governor and others in which Disney says it was punished for speaking out against Florida legislation that critics have dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.”Disney said in court papers filed Thursday that the request by attorneys for DeSantis, who declared his candidacy for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination earlier this week, didn't come close to meeting the standards set out in Florida law for requiring a judge to be disqualified.Last week, DeSantis' attorneys filed a motion seeking to disqualify Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who is presiding over the case in federal court in Tallahassee. The motion said Walker referenced the ongoing dispute between the DeSantis administration and Disney during hearings in two unrelated lawsuits before him dealing with free speech issues and fear of retaliation for violating new laws championed by the governor and Republican lawmakers.Under Florida law, grounds for disqualification include bias and a conflict of interest. In its response, Disney said the judge had shown no bias.“Judges are not prohibited from referring accurately to widely-reported news events during oral arguments, nor must they disqualify themselves if cases related to those events happen to come before them months later,” Disney said in its filing.Walker, who was nominated to the federal bench in 2012 by President Barack Obama and is now chief judge of the district, has said in court filings that he won’t take any action in the case until he rules on whether he should be disqualified.The feud between DeSantis and Disney started last year after the company, in the face of significant pressure, publicly opposed legislation concerning lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades that critics called “Don’t Say Gay.” As punishment, DeSantis took over Disney World’s governing district through legislation passed by lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors. Before the new board came in, the company signed agreements with the old board made up of Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of design and construction authority.Story continuesIn response, the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature passed legislation allowing the DeSantis-appointed board to repeal those agreements and made the theme park resort’s monorail system subject to state inspection, when it previously had been done in-house.Disney filed the First Amendment lawsuit against the Florida governor and the DeSantis-appointed board last month in federal court in Tallahassee, claiming violations of free speech and the contracts clause. The DeSantis-appointed board earlier this month sued Disney in state court in Orlando seeking to void the deals the company made with the previous board.Last week, Disney announced that it was scrapping plans to build a new campus in central Florida and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -11.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has lost 11.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share, indicating a change of -0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.1%. This estimate has changed -4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.20 indicates a change of +34.9% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Disney, the consensus sales estimate of $22.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.8%. The $89.98 billion and $94.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.8% and +5.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $21.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.3%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.03%. The EPS surprise was +4.49%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The filing proposes an increase of $119 million compared to ICC-approved rates that went in effect in January of this year.In 2022, ComEd’s program helped more than 630,000 customers save more than 11 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity – more than 100% of the annual goal.""Thanks to CEJA, we are offering a broader range of solutions to help people reduce energy use and costs,"" said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones. ""There are new opportunities for everyone, especially income-eligible customers, and we should all remember that using energy wisely and wasting less is one of the easiest ways for anyone to reduce their energy costs and fight climate change.""The ICC will review ComEd’s request over the next eight months and all costs must be found prudent and reasonable before they are included in customer rates. If approved, ComEd’s request will add approximately 56 cents to the average monthly residential bill beginning in January 2024.Enacted in 2021, CEJA allowed utilities to add to energy efficiency measures that electrify space heating, water heating, cooling, drying, cooking, industrial processes, and other building and industrial end uses that would otherwise require fossil fuel. In 2022, ComEd launched a four-year program to expand options for income-eligible (IE) customers. These include a $40 million whole home electrification program that enables residents to electrify their homes with HVAC systems, water heating, appliances, and necessary electrical upgrades. The company plans to significantly expand energy efficiency offerings for IE customers as part of its ComEd 2030 vision.Story continuesSince 2008, ComEd’s energy efficiency program has saved customers approximately $7.65 billion on their electric bills. It also has helped customers save more than 70 million MWhs of electricity, which is the annual equivalent to removing nearly 60 billion pounds of carbon emissions, taking nearly 6 million cars off the road or powering more than 8 million ComEd customers’ homes.Energy efficient lighting continued to contribute the most energy and peak demand savings last year – nearly 935,000 MWhs. In second place was voltage optimization (VO), a combination of advanced software, sensors and smart devices, which produced additional energy savings of nearly 180,000 MWhs – equivalent to eliminating more than 127,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. VO monitors and regulates voltage levels, delivering energy savings of up to 2 percent annually for the average ComEd customer.""The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act distinguishes Illinois as a national leader on energy policy and related investment,"" said William Angelos, acting executive director of Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (MEEA). ""We have a unique opportunity to set new standards for success in energy efficiency and demonstrate its power to manage energy use and costs, create healthy living environments, enhance business performance and create jobs. We are pleased to partner with ComEd and others who are equally committed to achieving these goals.""Last year, MEEA presented ComEd an Innovation Award for its Multi-Family Energy Savings offering, which gives residents in multi-family buildings access to offerings that lower their energy use and electric bills, while presenting similar options for building owners to make common areas more energy efficient. These programs provide a building assessment, installation of free and discounted energy-saving products in tenant spaces and common areas, incentives for larger capital projects, technical assistance, and, as needed, resolution of health and safety issues. This key offering will continue in 2024.MEEA also recognized ComEd with an Education Award for its Energy Efficiency Service Provider Incubator program, which has helped increase the number of local and diverse-owned businesses who can provide energy efficiency services to ComEd customers. This effort is funded by CEJA and is part of ComEd’s Market Development Initiative, which has an average annual budget of $4 million over four years.To make it easier for families and individuals to find energy-efficiency and bill-assistance options, ComEd encourages customers to use its Smart Assistance Manager (SAM), an online self-service tool that matches customers with programs that can help them manage their electric bills now and into the future. Customers can access SAM at ComEd.com/SAM. ComEd customers experiencing difficulty paying their electric bill are encouraged to call ComEd at 1-800-334-7661 (1-800-EDISON-1). More information is available at ComEd.com/PaymentAssistanceComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Shares have lost about 1.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Helmerich &amp; Payne due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Helmerich &amp; Payne Q2 Earnings Beat EstimatesHelmerich &amp; Payne reported fiscal second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. In the year-ago period, the company had incurred a loss of 17 cents per share. The outperformance reflects a significant uptick in drilling activities.Operating revenues of $769.2 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $741 million. The figure also increased 64.5% from the year-ago quarter’s level due to strong results from the North America Solutions segment. Sales from the unit totaled $675.7 million, ahead of the consensus mark of $659 million.Segmental PerformanceNorth America Solutions: Operating revenues of $675.7 million were up 65.3% year over year on higher activity levels, with the average number of active rigs at 183. Operating profit totaled $182.1 million compared with $1.3 million in the corresponding period of 2022. This improvement can be attributed to an increase in drilling activities owing to the surging oil and gas prices.Offshore Gulf of Mexico: Revenues of $35 million increased 20% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $29.1 million. During January-March of 2023, operating expenses surged 23% year over year. Operating profit came in at $6.7 million, up 26.7% from that recorded in the prior-year period.International Solutions: Sales in this segment increased to $55.8 million from $27.4 million in the comparable period of 2022. This was due to improved activity levels, with the average number of active rigs at four. The unit reported a profit of $4 million against a loss of $848,000 million in the prior-year period.Story continuesFinancial PositionIn the reported quarter, HP spent $181.5 million on capital programs. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $159.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, while the long-term debt was $542.7 million (debt-to-capitalization of 16.5%).GuidanceFor the fiscal third quarter, Helmerich &amp; Payne anticipates operating gross margin in the North America Solutions and Offshore Gulf of Mexico segments to be in the range of $265-$285 million and $5.5-$7.5 million, respectively. The company expects to exit the quarter with around 155-160 contracted rigs.Operating gross margin in the International Solutions segment is forecasted at a loss of $4-$7 million for the next fiscal quarter.Helmerich &amp; Payne estimates capital outlay between $400 million and $450 million for 2023. The company projects depreciation and amortization expenses at about $400 million, and research and development expenses at roughly $30 million.General and administrative expenses are anticipated at $205 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -23.21% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Helmerich &amp; Payne has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Helmerich &amp; Payne has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

However, a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session, which could mean that the stock found support with bulls being able to counteract the bears. So, it could witness a trend reversal down the road.The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this dental products manufacturer enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.1-month candlestick chart for XRAYUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade ItThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Story continuesLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for XRAYThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for XRAY lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 2% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering XRAY are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that XRAY currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for Dentsply is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

186,2162addb-b133-3a86-8bd4-b1f9355880c6,CMCSA,2023-05-27,An Intrinsic Calculation For Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Suggests It's 39% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-comcast-corporation-nasdaq-110020618.html,1685185220,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Key InsightsComcast's estimated fair value is US$64.32 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityComcast is estimated to be 39% undervalued based on current share price of US$39.48Our fair value estimate is 42% higher than Comcast's analyst price target of US$45.38Does the May share price for Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$12.9bUS$14.3bUS$15.7bUS$16.5bUS$17.9bUS$18.9bUS$19.7bUS$20.5bUS$21.2bUS$21.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x14Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 5.60%Est @ 4.55%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$11.9kUS$12.2kUS$12.3kUS$11.9kUS$11.9kUS$11.6kUS$11.2kUS$10.7kUS$10.2kUS$9.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$113bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$349bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$349b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$155bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$268b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$39.5, the company appears quite good value at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Comcast as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.073. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ComcastStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

In order to skip our detailed ranking and jump directly to the top shows on Hulu currently, go to 10 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 2023.Over the last few decades, television (TV) has changed from being a luxury to a standard feature in households. In 2022, the total global revenue attributed to the television industry amounted to $93.76 billion. While TV remains a key feature in our daily lives, rapid technological changes are taking place in the industry as well with multiple new technologies capturing the market, specifically in the digital space. Cable TV is experiencing stagnation, and the subscription-based, video-on-demand model is growing in popularity.Subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) is a model in which users pay a monthly or annual fee in exchange for receiving service streaming access for that time to an online library of movies, TV shows, and other content. Projections on Statista indicate that the number of subscription video-on-demand model subscribers will rise above 1.6 billion in 2027. It stood at 1.2 billion in 2021. SVOD revenue in the United States is likely to cross $95 billion in 2023, whereas it is estimated to reach around $160 billion worldwide in the same year. This revenue is expected to further grow globally at an annual rate of 9.71%, which is projected to raise the market volume to $230 billion by 2027.The SVOD industry continues to remain competitive. Major players in the market include Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, YouTube Premium, Hotstar, and HBO to name a few.The focus of this article is on the 25 best TV shows on Hulu in 2023. Hulu, which was launched in October 2007, is an American subscription-based streaming service. It is owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) holding a minority stake through NBCUniversal. It started off as a joint venture initially between New Corporation and NBC Universal, and later The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). That helped the platform gain access to television series of all these broadcasting companies. Hulu’s subscription service started in 2010 with the launch of Hulu Plus. It featured un-delayed access to television series of different partner companies. Story continuesHulu currently has over 48 million subscribers who have access to Hulu’s library, offering them to watch a wide range of movies and television series produced by Hulu’s original programming, as well as companies such as 20th Century Studios, ABC, and Disney Television Studios (NYSE:DIS). In 2016, Hulu announced to devote itself entirely to the subscription model and discontinue its on-demand video service by syndicating it to Yahoo! Screen. In 2017, Hulu inaugurated an over-the-top live TV service.2023 has been a promising year for Hulu in terms of numbers and recognition. In the first quarter of the fiscal year, the company had an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $92.32. It was nominated for 10 awards at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards, winning three. Several new TV shows have been released this year and existing shows are being renewed for a new season. At the same time, there are shows that were released decades ago but remain popular among the viewers, such as General Hospital (1963), M*A*S*H (1972), Full House (1987), Rugrats (1991), The X-Files (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Futurama (1999), Freaks and Geeks (1999), and others.Below is the list of trending shows on Hulu which you should not miss out on this year.25 Best TV Shows on Hulu in 2023Photo by Tech Daily on UnsplashMethodologyConsensus method has been used to rank the 25 best TV shows to watch on Hulu in 2023. Top 100 popular Hulu shows on IMDb, Reelgood, and Rotten Tomatoes were analyzed. Rating scores for each show on each of these three websites were studied. Weights were assigned to each score. For example, a show rated 100 out of 100 received a weight of 1, whereas a score of 95 was weighed at 0.95. Weights of a TV show on all three websites were summed together to determine their final score. The maximum aggregated score a show could achieve was 3. In case scores of two or more shows matched, their ranking was decided depending on the year of their release. A show released before the other was ranked higher because it managed to retain a higher rating for a longer period.25. SnowfallScore: 2.57 out of 3 Year: 2017 - 2023We start the list with Snowfall on 25th. The show is a crime drama series with the main character Damson Idris playing the role of a drug dealer who sells cocaine in Los Angeles during the 1980s crack epidemic. The first season was released in 2017 and concluded with its sixth and final season in April 2023.24. The Handmaid’s TaleScore: 2.58 out of 3 Year: 2017 - PresentNext on the list on the 24th is the dystopian TV series, The Handmaid’s Tale, which is based on a novel authored by Margaret Atwood in 1985. The plot is set in the times following the Second American Civil War and shows a theocratic and totalitarian society subjecting fertile women to child-bearing slavery. The show first premiered in 2017 and has had five seasons so far. It has been renewed for a sixth and final season.23. How I Met Your MotherScore: 2.60 out of 3 Year: 2005 - 2014American sitcom, How I Met Your Mother, is ranked 23rd on our list. The show aired from 2005 through 2014.

The show is based on survivors of a flight traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles crashing on a mysterious island. Lost was released in 2010 and was aired for six seasons until 2010. The TV show’s popularity can be judged from the fact that, on average, 11 million viewers watched every episode of its sixth season. Lost also won the Best American Import Award at the 2005 British American Television Awards.21. Chainsaw ManScore: 2.62 out of 3 Year: 2022 – PresentJapanese manga series Chainsaw Man is 22nd on the list. The show originally ran from 2018 but has been on Hulu since 2022.

189,e2a5a307-928d-33fd-bb81-ece12afb9b05,CMCSA,2023-05-27,Comcast CEO Mulls Next Big Move in Shifting Media Landscape,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcasts-ceo-considering-next-big-113022821.html,1685100622,STORY,"['CMCSA', 'BAC']","[(Bloomberg) -- Comcast Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts has a penchant for lining up a huge deal around every five years or so. It was 2018 the last time he made a big acquisition, and Wall Street is ready for his next dramatic move.Most Read from BloombergChina Is Drilling a 10,000-Meter-Deep Hole Into the EarthInside the Making of Redfall, Xbox’s Latest MisfireWall Street Banks Are Using AI to Rewire the World of FinanceDebt-Limit Deal Passes the House, Easing US Default ConcernsBillionaire Perot Warns of Real Estate Recession as Loans Dry UpThe stakes have arguably never been higher for the media and communications giant: Comcast is losing cable TV subscribers at record rates. Growth in its broadband internet business has dried up amid fierce competition from the likes of Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. The NBCUniversal division has been shaken by the departures of CEO Jeff Shell, who was ousted last month amid sexual harassment allegations, and ad chief Linda Yaccarino, who jumped ship to run Twitter. The likely sale of streaming service Hulu looms large and Hollywood writers are on strike. Comcast’s shares are down about 32% since peaking nearly two years ago.As the largest cable TV and broadband provider in the US, Comcast has gotten too big to acquire any more cable companies. But Roberts has embraced the idea of owning more of the content his cable system can deliver. His next big move will most likely involve Comcast’s media division, an entertainment business that includes the NBC broadcast network, a stable of cable channels, the Universal and DreamWorks movie studios, streaming platforms including Peacock and a stake in Hulu, and theme parks. And yet, Comcast lacks the breadth and depth of content to rival Disney and Netflix.If Comcast has a “missing piece, it’s in media,” said Geetha Ranganathan, media analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. And there’s one obvious fit. Like many companies, Comcast is probably “taking a closer look at gaming for the next leg of growth and customer engagement,” she said.Story continuesRoberts may have tipped his hand last year when he briefly explored a deal involving video-game company Electronic Arts Inc., home of popular titles like Madden NFL and Star Wars. Comcast followers suspect he would still like to add that kind of highly lucrative content to his empire, possibly in deals with companies like Nintendo Co., Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. or even Activision Blizzard Inc. if Microsoft Corp.’s planned takeover fails.“When you heard they were willing to merge with EA, it makes you think anything could happen,” said Bank of America media analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. “Gaming is a business with property rights that adapt well with film, television and even theme parks,” she said.Whether it’s in gaming or media, Roberts faces pressure to acquire or combine media assets that would help create a larger entity, particularly in streaming.One widely anticipated solution is to combine NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the home of CNN, the Food Network and HBO’s Succession. The new venture would offer a wealth of content from sports to shows and movies on a scale that could catapult it to the big leagues.“That would create a truly indispensable streaming product for any household,” said Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino.But a tie-up with Warner Bros. could also face antitrust hurdles in attempting to merge the parent of CNN with MSNBC, and regulators in the Biden administration have had trouble with many even smaller deals. In any case, such a move would have to wait until April 2024, when certain when certain tax advantages that benefitted the Warner Bros. and AT&amp;T Inc. deal are out of the way.An easier path would be gaming, where Comcast would be a new entrant and present very few antitrust concerns. Plus, the company has already enjoyed blockbuster success with NBCUniversal Pictures’ adaptation of the popular Super Mario Bros. game into the biggest box office hit of the year.“Gaming allows deeper engagement with audiences and builds better experiences,” Ranganathan said. “Comcast can potentially mine these characters. Super Mario is a great example of a game, movie and theme park attraction.”The timing of any major move by Roberts could be tied to a likely decision to sell Comcast’s Hulu stake early next year. Comcast and Disney have an agreement for Disney to purchase Comcast’s one-third stake in a deal that values Hulu at a minimum of $27.5 billion. Comcast, meanwhile, also has the option to buy out Disney’s majority stake. If Roberts sells, he gets at least $9 billion to pump back into the business, fund a deal or pay off investors in a share buyback.Even if Roberts gives up Hulu, he’s leaning into streaming platforms like Peacock, which he sees as the future of TV.Comcast is in a late and slow transition toward an online consumer video offering that can be a landing place for fleeing traditional TV customers. Peacock is Comcast’s video salvation, but right now it’s relatively puny with 22 million subscribers — compared with Disney+’s nearly 160 million — and poised to lose $3 billion this year. At a recent investor conference, Roberts said Comcast would take steps to reduce the losses at Peacock, by charging pay-TV customers for access, instead of automatically including it in their cable service.Roberts has spent his career at the company his father Ralph Roberts co-founded and controls a third of the stock voting rights, a possible complication for activist investors. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners bought a stake in Comcast in 2020 saying it was undervalued and held discussions with management. A year ago Trian announced that it sold its Comcast stake.Roberts is advised by his close No. 2, President Michael Cavanagh, who spent most of his career in banking. While Cavanagh has been at the company for almost eight years, the fact that Roberts added the media unit to his duties after Shell was ousted, rather than tap an industry vet or any of the several qualified candidates at NBC Universal, suggests there is a plan for action.Roberts has been leaning more on Cavanagh lately. He told investors that Cavanagh has a take-charge calming influence that “reminds me a little bit of my dad.” As for leadership direction, Roberts said, “there’s an opportunity for the right kind of leader to step in and say, ‘How do we get the benefit of all these businesses working together?’”He added: Cavanagh is “helping us drive in a way that I think will be better than we’ve done historically.”Analysts have been fishing for clues as to what the next step may be. On an earnings call last month, the word “strategy” came up 20 times. The last time that word was used as frequently was on an earnings call five years ago, right after Comcast announced it’s last big deal – the cross-border takeover of UK TV broadcaster and broadband provider Sky Plc.Cavanagh took most of the strategy questions and suggested nothing is afoot. “There is no reason for anyone to think that we’re going to be revisiting strategy,” he said.While deal speculation swirls around the company, on the inside Comcast is running at “peak investment capacity,” putting money into transformative efforts like the pivot to streaming and a complete overhaul of its cable network to boost capacity, Chief Financial Officer Jason Armstrong said in an interview.“There’s a lot of things we’re doing internally, so to the extent there’s something we’re looking to do inorganically to add to the portfolio - the bar is set pretty darn high,” Armstrong said.Philadelphia-based Comcast still makes the bulk of its $121 billion in annual revenue from cable and broadband subscribers, but investors describe that side of the business as a slowly melting ice cube. TV subscribers are cutting the cord in record numbers and broadband growth has nearly vanished in the face of rival fiber and wireless internet offerings from phone companies. Recently, Comcast has stemmed some of the losses by bundling low-cost mobile-phone service with broadband. Even if Roberts goes for a flashy Hollywood deal with Warner Bros., Comcast will still be the US’s biggest cable and broadband company.That’s why not everyone thinks the media division should be the focus of attention right now.Roberts has been opportunistic on deals, “creating great value for shareholders, particularly with NBCUniversal,” said Duff &amp; Phelps managing director Ben Bielawski, whose firm has been a long time Comcast investor. But “media doesn’t move the stock and is more of a distraction,” he said.If anything, the most recent financial results, which showed better-than-expected broadband and wireless customer gains, “take the pressure off” any need to do a deal right away. Eventually, Bielawski said, the company will find some way to “monetize” the media business.To Comcast’s loyal core investors, showbiz isn’t just a distraction, it’s a burden. The company’s cable TV and broadband business brings in twice as much revenue as the media unit but isn’t growing. And while cable subscriptions and ads generate more than four times the adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization that NBCU does, a big portion of that money is spent on the media side.When the core business is funding another business you get what MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett calls the “conglomerate discount.” And media isn’t exactly a safe haven. Comcast has placed a big bet on entertainment at a time of falling profits and a production halt due to what could be a lengthy writers’ strike, and its streaming service is just a minnow swimming in a rough sea of sharks like Netflix.Despite the obstacles, Roberts may have an opening now that media assets have fallen from sky-high valuations.“This is a jump ball moment for the industry,” said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist at HighMark Capital Management. “We’re in a reset, after a period of chasing growth and over-investment when money was free.”--With assistance from Liana Baker.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Summer Camp Became Such a Hot Mess for ParentsHarvard MBA Grads Enter a Tepid Job Market Hoping for the BestGoldman CEO Loves Summer Camp So Much He’s Expanded His PortfolioCan Workplace Ketamine Retreats Improve Vibes in the Office?Assault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare Startup©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"
190,86580417-6c52-3bc6-8c20-85fa9662ae41,DVN,2023-05-27,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-trending-130010060.html,1685106010,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -8.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share, indicating a change of -43.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.30 points to a change of -24.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.85 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -29.1%. The $16.11 billion and $16.61 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -16% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, it unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with an annualized yield of approximately 0.4%. The company also repurchased $250 million of stock under its existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program.Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $7.95 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.12 by 2.1%. The reported figure, however, increased 38.7% from the prior-year figure of $5.73 per share.Total revenues of $3.285 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $3.14 billion by 4.7% and grew 30.2% year over year.Rental revenues increased 26% from the year-ago quarter to $2.74 billion. This upside was mainly attributable to broad-based demand growth across end markets served by the company. Also, Ahern Rentals buyout contributed to the growth. Fleet productivity was up 2% and average original equipment costs increased 25.6% year over year.Used equipment sales rose 83.9% from a year ago. Used equipment sales produced an adjusted gross margin of 59.5%, which expanded 170 basis points (bps) due to strong pricing.Story continuesSegment DiscussionGeneral Rentals: This segment registered 26.7% year-over-year growth in rental revenues to $2.018 billion. Rental gross margin contracted 320 bps year over year to 32.9%, thanks to the Ahern Rentals acquisition.Specialty (earlier known as Trench, Power and Pump): Segmental rental revenues increased 24.1% year over year to $722 million. Rentals gross margin expanded 260 bps on a year-over-year basis to 47.1%. This was backed by better cost performance and fixed cost absorption on higher revenues.MarginsThe company’s total equipment rentals gross margin fell 170 bps year over year to 36.6%. Adjusted EBITDA for the reported period grew 32% year over year to $1.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin also increased 70 bps to 45.8%.Balance SheetUnited Rentals had cash and cash equivalents of $99 million as of Mar 31, 2023, down from $106 million at 2022-end.

Return on invested capital increased 220 bps year over year and 40 bps sequentially to a record 13.1% for the trailing 12 months that ended Mar 31, 2023.Cash from operating activities increased 6% year over year to $939 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow, including merger and restructuring-related payments, declined 16.4% year over year to $478 million for the quarter due to higher net rental capital expenditures.2023 Guidance ReaffirmedTotal revenues are expected in the range of $13.7-$14.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $6.6 billion and $6.85 billion.Net rental capital expenditure after gross purchases is projected within $2-$2.25 billion, indicating a decrease from $2.471 billion in 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities is anticipated in the range of $4.4-$4.8 billion, suggesting a rise from $4.433 billion in 2022.Free cash flow (excluding the impact of merger and restructuring-related payments) is expected in the range of $2.1-$2.35 billion compared with $1.768 billion reported in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.47% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, United Rentals has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

This compares to earnings of $0.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -186.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this cryptocurrency-mining computer maker would post a loss of $0.19 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.30, delivering a surprise of -57.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Canaan , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $55.23 million for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.46%.

(NASDAQ:MU) due to an unfavorable cybersecurity review outcome from China. The considerable revenue loss from being banned in China may affect the fundamentals of the company much deeper. However, a few robust bullish catalysts for Micron remain, such as proactive performance measures and a rapid shift towards Japan.Micron Seeks Other Avenues for Growth Amidst China's BanWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with MU. Click here to check it out. MU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MUPeter Lynch Chart of MUMU Data by NASDAQ:NVDA) for the RTX 4070TI, position the company well for growth in the graphics segment.In the mobile and intelligent edge markets, Micron expects slight declines in smartphone units for 2023 but foresees improved mobile customer inventories and a bit of shipment growth in the second half of the fiscal year. The upcoming revenue from the 1-beta 16GB LP5X and successful mobile customer design wins further highlight the company's commitment to this segment.Micron's revenue growth in the automotive sector is expected to continue, driven by the qualification and shipment of advanced automotive storage solutions. Stability in customer inventories in the industrial segment also indicates a potential improvement in demand in the latter half of fiscal 2023.The setback with China's banThe ban imposed by China on Micron's products due to alleged cybersecurity risks has raised concerns about the company's prospects. Notably, sales to China accounted for about 11% of the company's revenue in past earnings results. With the ban in place, Micron will likely endure a decline in revenue in the short term. While the ban is narrowly focused on critical information infrastructure (CII) operators, the overall impact on revenue may reach that level. However, a more realistic estimate from Bloomberg suggests a low-single-digit percentage impact in the near term.Micron Seeks Other Avenues for Growth Amidst China's BanSource: BloombergHowever, it's worth it to note that Micron's fiscal second quarter 2023 revenue shows a decline of 10% quarter-over-quarter and a significant 53% year-over-year decrease. The revenue reduction could intensify due to the ban in China. The loss of a substantial market like China and the ban's impact on sales can further contribute to a decline in Micron's financial performance in the short term.Story continuesChina plays a vital role in the electronics supply chain, and the ban could disrupt Micron's supply chain and customer relationships globally. The ban may lead to challenges in meeting demand for Micron's products, resulting in potential complications and hurdles soon. Managing supply chain disruptions and maintaining customer relationships will be critical for Micron's success.Micron operates in a highly competitive industry, facing intense competition. The ban on Micron's products in China may allow its competitors to strengthen their market positions in the country. Aggressive pricing strategies by competitors could also impact Micron's market share and profitability. Consolidating competitors may disadvantage Micron, as larger corporations with greater resources and manufacturing scale could gain a stronger position in the market.Further, the ban on Micron may intensify China's abiliity to enhance its domestic chip-making capabilities and reduce its reliance on foreign technology. While China's chip-making ability is currently limited compared to the U.S. and Europe, the ban could accelerate China's efforts to acquire or develop cutting-edge chip technologies. As a result, it poses a potential threat to Micron in global markets as China aims to achieve self-sufficiency in advanced chip technologies.Progressive performance measuresMicron is concentrating on progressive performance by maintaining its technological competitiveness while managing node ramps to align bit supply with demand. In terms of DRAM, the company has made significant progress in transitioning from 1-alpha to 1-beta, with 1-alpha representing the majority of its DRAM bit production. As a result, the yields on 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND have reached record levels, surpassing any previous node in the company's history. Additionally, the targeted yields for 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND have been achieved ahead of schedule, showcasing the company's efficiency.Micron has also made strides in NAND production, with 176- and 232-layer nodes now accounting for over 90% of NAND bit production. In particular, QLC (quad-level cell) NAND accounted for more than 20% of the company's NAND bit production and shipments in the fiscal second quarter. These developments indicate Micron's commitment to enhancing its technology and optimizing its production processes.Looking forward, Micron aims to introduce its EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet)-based 1-gamma node in 2025, expected to deliver competitive performance, power efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and increased density. This forward-looking approach indicates Micron's commitment to technological advancement and its drive to maintain a competitive edge in the memory and storage markets.Notably, Micron is reducing its supply by adding additional reductions to its fiscal 2023 capex plan. It now expects to invest approximately $7 billion, which represents a decrease of more than 40% YoY, with WFE (Wafer Fab Equipment) down by over 50% YoY. Furthermore, Micron has reduced DRAM and NAND wafer production by approximately 25%, further aligning its supply with market demand.Micron is also focusing on reducing operational expenses. The company anticipates an overall headcount reduction of around 15%, achieved through a combination of workforce reductions and anticipated attrition throughout the calendar year. These cost-cutting measures reflect Micron's commitment to improving its operational efficiency.While Micron has faced competitive pressures in the market, the company has maintained its flat bit-share strategy. In addition, it has reduced prices to remain competitive but has not pursued price reductions to gain market share, recognizing that customer share changes are often temporary. This strategy demonstrates Micron's focus on long-term stability and sustainable growth.In terms of financial resilience, Micron boasts a strong balance sheet among pure-play memory and storage companies. Moreover, its robust liquidity position ensures the company can weather market downturns while maintaining its competitiveness in its product and technology.Micron Seeks Other Avenues for Growth Amidst China's BanShifting towards JapanMicron's investment of $3.6 billion in Japan for DRAM chip production represents a significant step toward bolstering chip manufacturing capabilities and strengthening the chip supply chain. In addition, DRAM technology represents 74% of its revenue as of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Therefore, the move will have significant implications for Micron's value growth.Micron Seeks Other Avenues for Growth Amidst China's BanSource: Investor PresentationAdditionally, Micron is set to receive approximately $1.5 billion in financial incentives from the Japanese government. This significant investment aims to support Micron's production of next-generation memory chips in Japan, which will contribute to the country's efforts to strengthen its domestic semiconductor industry and reduce dependence on chip imports. The move comes at a time of escalating tensions between the U.S. and China, making it crucial for Japan to enhance its chip manufacturing capabilities.The financial support from the Japanese government will be utilized by Micron to install advanced chip-making equipment using EUV lithography technology at its facility in Hiroshima. This cutting-edge EUV technology will enable Micron to produce the next generation of DRAM chips, known as 1-gamma chips (with advanced end-to-end technology). These 1-gamma chips are expected to have the world's smallest cell size, offering faster, more power-efficient and higher-performance memory products.Interestingly, the Japanese government has already allocated substantial funding for various chip-related projects, such as the development of 2-nanometer chips by Rapidus and the establishment of a joint chip research center. These initiatives demonstrate Japan's commitment to nurturing a robust domestic semiconductor industry and attracting major chipmakers to set up fabrication facilities in the country.The Hiroshima facility holds strategic importance for Micron, as it houses the company's top engineers and has been the focus of previous investments. Micron's decision to use EUV lithography in Japan highlights the significance of this location and its role in the global supply chain. Furthermore, Micron's commitment to increasing chip production in the United States, as evidenced by its investment in a semiconductor factory in New York, aligns with its efforts to secure domestic manufacturing capabilities that, in turn, sustain long-term earnings momentum.TakeawayIn conclusion, Micron Technology's strategic shift towards Japan for DRAM chip production, coupled with the financial incentives provided by the Japanese government, represents a significant step in bolstering its chip manufacturing capabilities and mitigating potential losses from China's ban.While the prohibition poses revenue concerns and disrupts the supply chain, Micron remains resilient through proactive performance measures. Moreover, Micron's commitment to increasing chip production in the United States further secures its long-term earnings momentum. Despite challenges and intensified competition, I believe Micron is well-positioned for future growth.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Photo: Handout&gt;China's top server makers, including Inspur Group and Lenovo Group, have asked suppliers to suspend shipments of modules containing memory chips made by Micron, according to a South China Morning Post report on Friday, citing a supplier with knowledge of the situation.A media representative of Memblaze declined to comment on Friday, while the company did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Story continuesMicron also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.The CAC's Cyber Security Review Office said on Sunday that Micron failed its review, which led to the ban on sales of the US firm's products to China's critical information infrastructure operators. These include a wide range of entities from telecommunications network operators to banks and water utilities.Founded in 2011, Memblaze buys DRAM and NAND chips from foreign memory chip suppliers to package them into its SSDs. The Beijing-based firm did not disclose the name of its top supplier in its prospectus, but other information in the document shows its close ties to Micron.Memblaze board member Yuan Rong previously worked for Micron in Shanghai as a lead engineer between 2008 and 2011, according to the prospectus. Zhang Zhiqing, a supervisor at Memblaze, served at Micron as an engineer between 2009 and 2011, followed by a shorter tenure between 2015 and 2016.Micron Semiconductor Asia, a subsidiary of the US firm, spent 660,000 yuan (US$93,286) in May 2021 to acquire a 1.37 per cent stake in Memblaze, months before the Chinese storage devices maker applied for an IPO on the tech-heavy, Nasdaq-like Star Market, according to public records on a Chinese company registry website and filings from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.Following the Micron sales ban, investors in related businesses in China are now in search of answers on how this development could affect them.Shenzhen Longsys Electronics, one of Micron's largest clients on the mainland, responded to investors' inquiries this week by assuring that its operations are ""normal and compliant with the laws"".China has been one of Micron's major markets, contributing about 11 per cent to the company's US$30.8 billion total revenue in 2022. The US firm expects to post low to high single-digit losses as a result of the ban.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

(NOV) Down 8.1% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nov-inc-nov-down-153144821.html,1685115104,STORY,"['NOV', 'STX']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nov Inc. (NOV). Shares have lost about 8.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nov Inc. due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.NOV Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/YNOV Inc. reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted net profit of 32 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 13 cents.Total revenues of $2 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. The figure also rose 26.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.5 billion.The improvement in both earnings and revenues can be attributed to the robust performance of NOV’s Rig Technologies and Completion &amp; Production Solutions segment.Segment PerformancesRig Technologies: The unit reported first-quarter revenues of $550 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $545 million. The figure also exceeded the prior-year quarter’s figure of $441 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $69 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64 million. The actuals also increased from $36 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2022.Wellbore Technologies: Revenues in this segment improved 22.5% to $745 million year over year. The figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $762 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $133 million increased from the year-earlier quarter’s level of $101 million but missed the consensus mark of $146 million. This could be due to ongoing supply-chain issues that hampered the segment’s drill pipe operations. Completion &amp; Production Solutions: The segment’s revenues rose 35.4% to $718 million year over year. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $701 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $54 million increased from the year-ago quarter’s level of $10 million. The figure also exceeded the consensus mark of $52 million, primarily due to better management of the ongoing supply-chain disruptions, an improved product mix and better execution of the company’s manufacturing plans.Story continuesBacklogAt the end of March 2023, order backlog for Rig Technologies’ capital equipment was $2.88 billion, including $251 million worth of new orders. The same for the Completion &amp; Production Solutions segment was $1.60 billion, comprising $407 million worth of new orders.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $774 million and long-term debt of $1.73 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 24.5%..OutlookDespite recent weakness in commodity prices, NOV's outlook for 2023 is positive for each of the three segments.The company expects its floating rig count to recover soon from the pandemic. Based on the FID projection and current contracting rate, many more rigs are likely to be in demand by 2024.For the second quarter, the company expects a mid-single-digit increase in revenues from the Completion &amp; Production Solutions segment. It also anticipates EBITDA flow-through in the lower 30% range and EBITDA margin in low-double digits for 2023.Activity growth in the Eastern Hemisphere and drill pipe manufacturing operations in Wellbore Technologies are expected to offset headwinds from softening activity in North America.  This, in turn, is anticipated to cause a sequential revenue improvement in the mid-single-digit percent range for the second quarter.The company also expects an inventory rise in the Rig Technologies segment. This is due to the flow of castings and forgings needed to support the unit’s backlog of spare parts, rig refurbishment and equipment repair. This inventory growth is expected to boost revenues in the second quarter and beyond.This business unit is also expected to gain from increased activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and the recapture of additional high-spec drilling motor market share.NOV is gaining wider adoption of its digital solutions through several agreements, including a recent global contract with a major integrated oil company to provide edge computing, edge-to-cloud and cloud-based solutions.The company expects continued market share gains in North America, and incremental activities in the Gulf of Mexico and international markets for 2023.It anticipates free cash flow in the range of $100-$300 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted 10.69% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Nov Inc. has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Nov Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNov Inc. belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Seagate (STX), has gained 5.8% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Seagate reported revenues of $1.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.6%. EPS of -$0.28 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.For the current quarter, Seagate is expected to post a loss of $0.17 per share, indicating a change of -110.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Seagate.

200,2e36218b-d976-3b8e-8b48-54cbc8c7e0b0,TRIP,2023-05-27,International travel will be 'hot' through the summer as borders open up,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/international-travel-hot-summer-borders-200136467.html,1685131296,VIDEO,['TRIP'],"[TripAdvisor CEO Matt Goldberg joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the summer travel season, the return of international travel, the impact of labor shortages on travel, and the increase of experiential travel.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: The summer travel season is here. And despite the pinch of inflation, Americans are paying up when it comes to travel. New data out from Tripadvisor saying that the market specifically for travel experiences is growing fast and estimates that the industry is going to be worth about $280 billion by 2025. Here to tell us more is Matt Goldberg. He's the CEO of Tripadvisor. Matt, it's great to see you here.So before we get into exactly what people are paying for, let's just talk about the overall summer travel season. How strong of a season do you expect this to be?MATT GOLDBERG: Well, we expect the summer travel season to be strong. You know, Americans are traveling again and summer travel is back. We can see it in the airports. We can see it on the roads. And that's going to be true, the peak season is off to a great start. So it's going to be one of the best weekends in almost two decades.Some with travel intent beyond Memorial Day is significantly higher than last year. And the vast majority of travelers are planning to take summer trips this summer. And they're even willing to spend more.Now, it doesn't mean that they're not going to be subject to some of the economic whims. They may make choices about staying closer to home. They may choose to drive rather than fly. But in the end, travel is back, and we're going to feel it this Memorial Day.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, you know, so let's talk about some of those trade offs that we're seeing met because it is fascinating to see even in the face of higher prices-- in the case of airfare, we're talking much higher prices-- travelers are still willing to pay the money there. So as they plan out their vacations, what's the trade down that we're seeing?Story continuesMATT GOLDBERG: We're not seeing a trade down. We're seeing perhaps the choice to go somewhere closer to home, maybe do a slightly shorter trip, and maybe, again, think very carefully about where you want to spend.But the truth is that we have seen over the last year and it's continuing, a shift from material goods to experiences, travel being one of the most defended discretionary spend in anybody's budget. And while Americans still have good financial savings in their accounts, they are prioritizing travel like never before.SEANA SMITH: Matt, when it comes to some of those pricing trends that you are seeing, let's start domestically. Are we starting to see some of those pricing pressures ease?MATT GOLDBERG: Well, look, I think pricing is always an interesting one to watch. Supply and demand is important. It's important to think about, you know, what consumers want and what they're willing to go into. I think that you will see a pricing ease in some areas. But I think you will also see a new normal of pricing, where, you know, pricing came up and now it's moderating and staying where it is. So as long as the consumer keeps spending, as long as there is demand, you know, price will hold.There are ways to take advantage, you know, when we think about how we try to serve the consumer at Tripadvisor, there's always options to meet every budget, whether it's where you're choosing to stay, how you're choosing to get there, or the kind of experience that you want to have.AKIKO FUJITA: Matt, you know, you're talking about some of the options being for Americans to take closer to home. But we've also seen strength on the international side of things, with a lot of countries, especially in Asia really opening up significantly over the last several months. What are you seeing on that front? And the thing that we keep hearing over and over about passport delays, how is that complicating those travel plans?MATT GOLDBERG: Yeah, international travel is clearly back. You know, share of international travel intent is returning to pre-pandemic levels in the US and EMEA. And, of course, APAC has opened up and we're seeing intent to travel there at more than double than last summer, for example. So travelers are willing to spend. They're willing to go far away. They're looking for experiences that are in far flung-- far flung places and are going to really enhance their lives and make memories.I think the passport situation is something that, you know, many of us in the industry have lobbied government to make sure that we are freeing up, you know, the visa situation, getting passports out there so that people can travel unobstructed. And I think you'll continue to see international be a category of travel that will be hot through the summer.SEANA SMITH: Matt, this weekend certainly going to be an early test here for some of those airlines that have struggled to keep up with demand, especially when we take into account what happened last summer. How big of a factor, how big of an issue do you see labor shortage being this time around?MATT GOLDBERG: Well, look, everybody's talking about how they've staffed up. We know that labor shortages last year were a real, sort of, weight on the system. I think many of the providers have learned their lessons. I just traveled actually twice this week, once internationally and once domestically.And, you know, it was easy and smooth. I traveled last night from New York to Boston, where I'm sitting today. And I can tell you, it really feels like in the airports, they have geared up and they're ready to take on the demand that's coming this weekend.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Matt, we have to ask you, since we're talking about travel here, what's the big travel plan you have? Youre in a hotel?MATT GOLDBERG: Well, I just-- yeah, right now I'm at my home in Boston. And we're going to spend the weekend here. But we're going to focus on experiences. We're going to focus on doing the things that my family loves to do, whether it's going to a new restaurant, taking a food walking tour in the North End, which is really fun. We may go and do a Revolutionary War experience, touring through Boston. We'll probably go see some music.So we are very focused on experiences.

A solid 2023 business outlook also acts as a tailwind for the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceEncompass Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The stock has gained 6.5% in the past six months, against the industry’s 1.5% decline. The Zacks Medical sector has declined 3.8% but the S&amp;P 500 composite increased 5.6% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreEHC is well-poised for progress, as evidenced by its impressive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Robust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Encompass Health’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $3.17 per share, indicating an improvement of 11.2% from the year-earlier reading. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $3.52 per share, suggesting 11% growth from the 2023 estimate.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 11.7%, better than the industry’s average of 10.6%.Northbound Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised upward 3.3% in the past 30 days.Sound Earnings Surprise HistoryThe bottom line of Encompass Health outpaced earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average surprise being 4.88%.Solid Return on EquityThe return on equity for EHC currently stands at 16.8%, which is higher than the industry’s average of 7.7%. The figure substantiates the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.A Favorable 2023 OutlookEHC anticipates revenues within $4,700-$4,770 million this year, the midpoint of which indicates an improvement of 8.9% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to lie between $2.94 and $3.23, the midpoint of which suggests 8.2% growth from the 2022 figure.Story continuesBusiness TailwindsAfter witnessing a CAGR of 7.2% over the past 12 years (2010-2022), the top line of Encompass Health improved 9.5% in the first quarter of 2023 as well. Revenues continue to benefit on the back of rising patient volumes.An aging U.S. population along with the need for effective rehabilitative services that empower individuals to resume daily activities is likely to provide a ground for EHC to capitalize on through its Inpatient Rehabilitation unit. The importance of the segment can be substantiated by its decision to divest the home health and hospice business in order to intensify focus on growing its core Inpatient Rehabilitation segment.Encompass Health follows an active expansion endeavor throughout the year in the form of disclosing plans to set up inpatient rehabilitation hospitals across different U.S. communities and inaugurating the same within a reasonable time period. In the remainder of 2023, EHC plans to open three more de novos and add 93 beds to its existing hospitals.Each hospital inauguration advances the capabilities and expands the nationwide foothold of Encompass Health. For constructing the hospitals, it often resorts to joint ventures with regional healthcare organizations, which in turn, empower the company to gain an in-depth knowledge of the healthcare needs in its immediate surroundings.Such expansion initiatives have broadened the healthcare portfolio of Encompass Health which currently contains 157 hospitals spread across 37 states and Puerto Rico. To pursue such uninterrupted growth-related investments, a solid financial position is of dire need, which puts EHC at an advantage.

GMED is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its international business and the pending merger with NuVasive. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results generate investors’ optimism. However, mounting expenses and a competitive landscape do not bode well for Globus Medical.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 19.7% compared to the 0.1% rise of the industry and a 2.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $5.36 billion. Globus Medical projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 12.7% compared with 13.8% of the industry. GMED’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 2.76%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Results: Globus Medical ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company delivered its highest quarterly revenues with a 21% year-over-year increase at the constant currency rate (CER). Within the United States, the Spine business witnessed notable gains across its product portfolio in expandables, biologics, MIS screws, 3D printed implants and cervical offerings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe robust performance of Enabling Technologies continued to be driven by ongoing robotic and imaging system sales. The rapid market interest and customer demand have positioned Excelsius3D, the company’s latest addition to the Excelsius Ecosystem, as a major growth driver in 2023.NuVasive Deal a Strategic One: On the first-quarter earnings call, the company provided an update regarding the pending merger with NuVasive. More than 99% of Globus Medical and NuVasive Class A shareholders have voted in support of the merger deal.Post regulatory approvals and the completion of the transaction, Globus Medical expects to deliver above 20% non-GAAP EPS accretion by the completion of the first full year following deal closure.Story continuesInternational Business Holds Potential: In the first quarter, Globus Medical’s international revenues grew 24.7% as reported and 31.5% at CER. The growth was led by international spinal implant businesses mainly in Australia, Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.Excluding Japan, the company delivered 30% CER growth in the spinal implant business. Double-digit growth was registered in most markets, with strong growth in key markets.DownsidesEscalating Expenses: In the first quarter, SG&amp;A expenses were up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses, primarily driven by sales compensation, as well as higher meetings, travel and training expenses. Despite an increase in the adjusted operating profit, the adjusted operating margin contracted 55 basis points.A Competitive Landscape: The presence of several players made the musculoskeletal device market intensely competitive. With the presence of larger players like Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic, Globus Medical needs to constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Estimate TrendGlobus Medical has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

210,37a5bed1-1077-3e87-a744-6b7bbc893505,OXY,2023-05-27,Is Trending Stock Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-occidental-petroleum-corporation-130011909.html,1685106011,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -2.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -63% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -44.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -10.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.31 indicates a change of +21.5% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -30.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.5 billion and $31.89 billion estimates indicate -17.8% and +4.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $7.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.9%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.68%. The EPS surprise was -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

211,9b4d7d73-7411-3e8d-abd7-5a2841185ff6,OXY,2023-05-27,3 Stocks That Will Soar Past the Debt Ceiling Brouhaha,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-soar-past-debt-113045819.html,1684841445,STORY,"['NEE', 'OXY']","[As if investors haven’t had enough to think about these last few years, now there’s a debt ceiling crisis to consider. But a little perspective can go a long way. First, this isn’t the first time the United States has butted up against its debt ceiling. And despite the posturing on both sides, there is no appetite for having the country default on its obligations. That doesn’t mean that the debt ceiling crisis will get resolved before the 11th hour. In fact, history suggests there’s more drama to come. But history also suggests that there are some sectors that have performed better than others in past debt ceiling crises.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe takeaway is that the debt ceiling impact on the stock market is unknown. Therefore, it’s time for investors to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. This means doing more of what many investors are already doing. In other words, finding stocks that historically perform well regardless of what is happening in the economy. With that in mind, here are three stocks for you to consider as the debt ceiling deadline approaches.  NEENextEra Energy $74.85OXYOccidental Petroleum $59.44GLDSPDR Gold Shares ETF $183.26NextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comIt’s often said that the best offense is a good defense. In the case of debt ceiling stocks to buy that means buying defensive stocks. Some of the best defensive stocks are utility stocks. And one of the best utility stocks to buy during the debt ceiling crisis is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE).  NextEra’s name implies a focus on renewable energy and the company has a number of renewable energy projects in its portfolio. As Larry Ramer reminded InvestorPlace readers, all of these projects are in the United States. That means it will benefit from the tax breaks for clean energy projects passed by Congress in 2022. But NextEra Energy is also a traditional electric utility with one of its largest service areas being in Florida. That means that the company will continue to grow both revenue and earnings on a year-over-year basis. Story continuesNEE stock is currently valued at around 22x earnings and pays an attractive dividend with a current yield of 2.51%.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOne of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks as of late has been Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Buffett recently increased his stake in OXY stock. It’s no secret that Buffett was buying OXY stock throughout 2022. But in a year when oil prices have been volatile, it’s worth noting that Buffett has continued to buy shares of the stock. In fact, his hedge fund’s total stake in the company is now over 24%.  As with many things in life, as the debt ceiling deadline approaches, the devil is in the details. And one sticking point has to do with accelerating the process for approving new energy projects. The Biden administration wants that acceleration limited to clean energy projects. The Republican-led plan out of the House of Representatives is pushing to include fossil fuel projects. Nobody is perfect, and that includes Buffett. But his recent purchase has to at least make you take notice. This is true with OXY stock trading for around 6.7x earnings and with analysts projecting an earnings upside of over 19% for the rest of the year. Coincidentally, that’s almost exactly the percentage gain analysts project for the company’s stock.  SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF Investment index funds concept with letter wooden blocks and lots of different currencies, ETFs to buy. Emerging markets ETFsSource: Eviart / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for an investment that can help guard your portfolio against a worst-case scenario, consider the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD). This is a way to invest in an alternative to the U.S. dollar without owning the physical metal.  Gold has become an attractive investment even as inflation is down from the 40-year highs it reached in 2022. The spot price of gold is up 8% in 2023 as of the market close on May 18, 2023. And many people believe that the price of gold will continue to go higher no matter what happens with the debt ceiling crisis. If the debt ceiling deadline passes without a deal, then many investors will likely flock to gold in an attempt to protect their wealth. But if a deal is reached without spending cuts, inflation is likely to remain above the Federal Reserve’s preferred target.  Either option is bullish for the SPDR Gold Shares fund which is the largest precious metals ETF with $59.44 billion of assets under management (AUM). The fund also has an attractive annual expense ratio of just 0.40% which is significantly below the average of its peers, which is currently around 0.69%.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In the first quarter of 2023, the company reported changes made by Buffett and his investment officers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. These investments were disclosed as of March 31, 2023, pursuant to the 13F regulatory filing with the SEC.If you’re considering improving your approach to investment, taking Buffett’s guidance might be a wise choice. Here are three of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks in the first quarter of 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCapital One Financial (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comBerkshire Hathaway added Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) to its portfolio during the quarter, amid the regional bank crisis that caused a decline in bank stocks. As of March 31, 2023, Berkshire held over 9.9 million shares in Capital One, valued at $954 million.Capital One specializes in providing credit cards and auto loans, but has also earned recognition for innovation. The company was featured in Fast Company’s 2023 Most Innovative Companies list for both business services and travel and hospitality. According to Fast Company’s Lydia Dishman, Capital One launched a business to business software in June 2022 that enables other large companies to use cloud and data management tools integral to their transformation into a cloud-based business.Holdings of COF stock increased following Berkshire Hathaway’s reveal of its nearly $1 billion stake in the credit cards-focused bank. After a few weeks of losses, the price of the shares increased to highs not seen since the beginning of May.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comConsidering the low energy costs, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) had a great first quarter, generating exceptional free cash flow of $1.7 billion, or a yearly dividend of 13% to 14%. The company is expected to continue on an upward trend, potentially increasing buybacks and dividend payouts for shareholders.Story continuesWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reportedly invested around $130 million in Occidental Petroleum equities as a component of its strategy to increase its stake in the oil giant.In March, Berkshire purchased shares of Occidental Petroleum on two separate occasions. As an outcome, they now hold about a 23.6% share in the business, that’s worth $13 billion. Berkshire also has $10 billion in preferred stock and warrants to acquire $5 billion more shares at $59.62. There are speculations that Berkshire may eventually acquire over 50% of Occidental and potentially take over the entire company.Occidental Petroleum concluded 2022 with robust proven reserves of 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, reflecting a solid reserve foundation. The business has a strong asset inventory and is in a good position to produce profits for its investors.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple LayoffsSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comConsidering Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a unique blend of tech and consumer companies, AAPL stock started to enter Warren Buffett’s portfolio in 2016. He was impressed with the company’s popularity among his grandchildren who would spend hours on their iPhones. Buffett has also praised Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook.Apple meets the investment standards of Buffett, including having a recognizable brand, a strong market position, reasonable valuations and an efficient capital return program. The business also boasts an outstanding staff of executives with a track record of paying dividends and purchasing shares to investors. Additionally, Apple has an impressive profit and loss profile in tech, with high gross and operating margins and a large net cash balance.Apple’s robust brand strength enables it to command higher prices and its financials have been consistently strong. The company has been a historically profitable investment and the recent increase in iPhone sales in Q1 2023 has boosted its revenue. Despite a downturn in the U.S. market, Apple’s global brand recognition has helped mitigate the impact of declining iPhone sales domestically.During Q2 2023 Apple achieved a revenue of $94.8 billion. Although the economic situation was challenging, Apple still set a record in services revenue. Additionally, the company saw a record March quarter in iPhone sales, generating $51.33 billion in revenue.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in AAPL.

213,3839cf35-a8f3-3cf6-810c-eae77836a087,OXY,2023-05-27,7 Overvalued Energy Stocks to Sell Before June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-overvalued-energy-stocks-sell-233205479.html,1684798325,STORY,"['HES', 'OXY', 'CVX', 'RIG', 'COP', 'SLB']","[It may be time to sell some of the top energy stocks, especially as they become overvalued. Sure, according to the International Energy Agency, rising post-Covid demand from China, coupled with tight supply, suggests that a crude oil rebound is possible later this year. However, U.S.-driven factors such as debt ceiling uncertainty and continued interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve may outweigh this, possibly pushing Light Sweet Crude prices (now in the low-$70s per barrel) to even lower prices. Having said that, it’s not as if all energy stocks are in for a big drop, if oil prices tumble again.Conversely, it’s not as if all names in this space have big room to run, if oil has yet another rebound. With these seven energy stocks to sell now, risk/return is not in your favor. Each one is relatively overvalued, with company-specific issues that further bolster their respective bear cases.COPConocoPhillips$103.73CVXChevron$152.44HESHess$133.08INTWorld Fuel Services$23.49OXYOccidental Petroleum$59.04RIGTransocean$6.33SLBSchlumberger$46.00InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsConocoPhillips (COP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comOn the surface, it may sound odd to consider ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) an overvalued stock. Shares in this oil and gas giant trade for 8.2 times trailing twelve-month earnings. However, keep in mind that energy prices are lower than they were for most of 2022. With this, it’s likely better to use forward valuation when it comes to determining whether COP stock is overvalued or undervalued. Based on sell-side forecasts, COP trades for 10.4 times forward earnings. Yes, compared to most stocks, this sounds like a low valuation.But when you compare ConocoPhillips to peers, this valuation may make COP one of the overvalued energy stocks. Alongside this, as Mizuho’s Nitin Kumar argued back in April, it may prove difficult for the company to live up to its 10-year outlook. The analyst even added there are more attractive opportunities out there among large energy stocks.Story continuesChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is held by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio of publicly-traded stocks.Yet with the “Oracle of Omaha” paring down Berkshire’s CVX stock position by 20% last quarter, the integrated oil and gas giant’s shares may be losing this Buffett seal of approval. The answer to this question is somewhat unclear. The legendary investor hasn’t made any public statements signaling why Berkshire is reducing its stake. Then again, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, it makes sense why Buffett is making an exit. Mainly, because CVX’s cash flow generation does not justify its current valuation (8.3 times TTM earnings). On purely valuation grounds, you may want to consider Chevron as one of the energy stocks to sell now.Hess (HES)Hess (HES) logo on a phone screenSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comWhile it’s possible I’m splitting hairs about the valuations of COP and CVX, it’s clear that oil and gas exploration and production company Hess (NYSE:HES) sports a rich multiple for an energy stock. HES stock currently trades for nearly 20 times TTM earnings. Based on 2023 earnings forecasts, Hess appears even more pricey, with a forward multiple of 28.7. Yes, there is a reason why HES has become one of the more overvalued energy stocks. As InvestorPlace’s Faisal Humayun pointed out in April, there is big potential with the company’s Guyana exploration projects.In the coming years, the development of these assets could result in massive profitability growth. Even so, with this potential upside largely priced in, shares may have little room to run from here. Likewise, if crude oil prices fall again, revisions to future earnings forecasts may push HES to much lower prices.World Fuel Services (INT)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comBased in Miami, Florida, World Fuel Services (NYSE:INT) is a marketer/wholesaler of aviation, marine, and ground transportation fuel. Analysts expect INT’s earnings to grow at a steady clip between this year and 2025. Two years from now, the company could earn $3.01 per share. Not too shabby, given the current INT stock price ($23.50 per share). Then again, maybe not. There is likely a high level of uncertainty behind future earnings forecasts for World Fuel Services.The company has a history of growth via acquisitions. Increasing earnings by 65% from 2022 may hinge too heavily on more successful dealmaking. The post-Covid boom times for aviation could also come to an end if the economic slowdown worsens. This too could weigh on INT’s future results.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett may be bailing on Chevron, but it’s a different story with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Berkshire continues to buy more shares in the E&amp;P company. Buffett’s firm now owns nearly 25% of it.However, at just under $60 per share, it’s questionable whether OXY stock is a bargain. Shares now trade at the higher end, valuation-wise, among E&amp;P stocks, with forward earnings multiple of 12. Occidental Petroleum’s latest quarterly results also fell short of expectations.The “Buffett factor” may be helping to keep OXY elevated, but it’s questionable how much longer this can continue. As InvestorPlace’s Joel Baglole argued earlier this month, as Buffett is not interested in buying the company outright, outside of an unforeseen spike in crude oil prices back to 2022 highs, it’s easy to see the energy stocks bubble that has emerged with OXY deflating from here.Transocean (RIG)An image of an offshore oil rigSource: Arild Lilleboe / Shutterstock.comTransocean (NYSE:RIG) traded below $1 per share during 2020, as the pandemic-driven collapse in oil prices dried up demand for the contract drilling firm’s services. Since oil’s epic comeback in 2021, however, RIG stock has rallied by more than six-fold. Yet while the oil and gas landscape has improved tremendously, it’s not as if this company has already pulled off a big recovery, in terms of its operating performance.Transocean reported net losses last year and is expected to remain in the red for 2023. Even as analyst forecasts call for the company to report positive earnings in 2024 and 2025, an additional drop in energy prices may mean results fall short of current expectations. All of this points to RIG being one of the energy stocks to avoid. Any bit of disappointment could send it sinking back to penny stock territory (under $5 per share).Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comUnlike Transocean, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is an oil services company that has been consistently profitable recently. Yet while this stock may have less uncertainty than turnaround play RIG, it’s possible that investors have pushed SLB to too high of a valuation.SLB stock today trades for 16.8 times TTM earnings, and 15.1 times forward earnings. Admittedly, SLB has historically traded for between 12 and 20 times earnings, during times of steady profitability. Still, shares could slip down to the lower end of this valuation range, if bullishness for the stock cools from here.Something that could dampen enthusiasm may be the prospect of stagnant oil prices. As InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer argued earlier this month, this could impact Schlumberger’s growth prospects. In turn, resulting in a de-rating for shares. Although downside risk may not be very high, consider SLB one of the energy stocks to sell now.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

214,b8c141cc-89b8-3e73-8994-32a5a6610ba7,OXY,2023-05-27,3 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Betting Big On Big-Time,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-warren-buffett-betting-180921991.html,1684778961,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'AAPL', 'OXY']","[It’s no secret that Warren Buffett’s favorite stock these days seems to be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech giant now accounts for about 47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. Buffett began buying shares in 2016 and pretty much hasn’t stopped. He added over 20 million more shares of Apple stock in the first quarter.Through a strategy of buy-and-hold investing and making big bets on stocks like Apple, the Oracle of Omaha has rightly built a reputation as the most successful investor of our lifetime. Since 1965, Berkshire Hathaway has returned nearly 3.8 million percent, a compound annual growth rate of 19.8%. That’s roughly double the returns of the S&amp;P 500. Put another way, $10,000 invested with Buffett 58 years ago would be worth some $378 million today. Yet, despite the outsized nature of his position in Apple, the tech giant represents just a relatively small percentage of Apple’s shares outstanding. Less than 6%, in fact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three other Warren Buffett stock picks that the investor is making big bets on by buying up large tranches of stock. In these cases, though, he also has a substantial ownership position in the company.Bank of America (BAC)Bank of America (BAC) logo on top of a retail office building.Source: 4kclips / Shutterstock.comMany people thought Buffett was giving up on banking after he sold off a number of his holdings in the first quarter. But rather than abandoning the sector, he’s more likely just repositioning himself away from regional banks. The billionaire investor still owns significant stakes in financial stocks, including 13% of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It’s one of the largest bank stocks in the country, and Buffett bought 22.8 million more shares in the first quarter. That brings his total position to over 1 billion shares, or 8.9% of Berkshire Hathaway’s total portfolio, which is second only to Apple.It’s a solid investment because Bank of America won’t crumble like the regional banks. With depositors worrying whether rising interest rates will put their local bank out of business, many are fleeing to larger institutions like Bank of America. The higher rates will also let it charge more for loans, boosting its bottom line.Story continuesBank of America also offers a better valuation than most of its peers. At just 8 times earnings, a fraction of its book value, and an even smaller percentage of its cash, it offers a decent discount to the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOil and gas giant Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) also continues to be one of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks. After buying almost $8 billion worth of shares last year, he is still buying the stock hand over fist. During the March quarter, he purchased another $1 billion worth of shares, increasing his stake to 24.4%.Although some believed he wanted to acquire the whole company, Buffett says that’s not true. At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, The Street quoted him as saying, “There’s speculation about us buying control, we’re not going to buy control. We wouldn’t know what to do with it.” Buffett does, however, have regulatory permission to buy up to 50% of the stock. As global demand for fossil fuels remains strong, oil prices will remain elevated. Buffett believes the huge oil-producing Permian Basin region will be a big deal for years to come. When he acquired preferred stock of Occidental back in 2019, he said it was “a bet on the fact that the Permian Basin is what it is cracked up to be.”Occidental also owns OxyChem, one of the premier chemical companies in the U.S. This stock is a multi-pronged play for Warren Buffett’s portfolio.Paramount Global (PARA)Paramount Plus mobile app icon is seen on an iPhone representing PARA stock.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comMedia and entertainment conglomerate Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is the stock Buffett loves to hate. He recently told CNBC‘s Becky Quick, “It isn’t fundamentally that good of a business.” He also said the studio’s decision to slash its dividend from 24 cents per share to 5 cents per share is “not good news,” even if necessary.Yet on the list of Warren Buffett’s latest buys and sells, Paramount was a hold. He owns some 93 million shares worth $1.4 billion, or more than 15% of outstanding shares. Why continue to own it if he doesn’t like the business? Maybe as an arbitrage play.Buffett says the dog-eat-dog world of streaming will only survive with fewer players. He told Quick, “You’ve got some people with deep pockets that aren’t going to quit.” This may suggest Buffett thinks Paramount could be acquired. “We’ll see what happens,” he said.The stock is down 50% over the past year and trades at just 10 times next year’s earnings estimates. It also goes for just a fraction of its sales and book value. But that’s also because of the very weak business Buffett alluded to. Sometimes a cheap stock is cheap for a reason. The discount, however, just might be enough to attract a buyer in the potential shakeout to come.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Shares have lost about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Boston Scientific due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Boston Scientific Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Margins GrowBoston Scientific posted adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents for the first quarter of 2023, up 20.5% from the year-ago figure. The figure also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3%. The figure exceeded the company’s adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 42-44 cents.The quarter’s adjustments included certain amortization expenses, acquisition/divestitures-related net charges, and restructuring charges, among others.Reported earnings per share for the first quarter was 21 cents, a 200% rise from the year-ago quarter figure of 7 cents.First-quarter revenues of $3.39 billion improved 12% year over year on a reported basis and 14.9% on an operational basis (at a constant exchange rate or CER). Revenues grew 14% on an organic basis (adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations and certain recent acquisitions and divestments). The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9%.

The authorities alleged the two banks not only “failed to submit required plans demonstrating their efforts to root out discrimination,” but also “outright refused to submit required policies,” according to their press release.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesAs a result, New York City comptroller Brad Lander joined the mayor’s office and the department of finance in freezing new deposits at the banks. (The halt applies only for City agency funds, and not New York City residents.)The latest actions are the result of new requirements introduced in February that assess banks’ commitment to non-discrimination practices in lending, employment,  and other services.Quotable: Demanding fairness from banks“Banks seeking to do business with New York City must demonstrate that they will be responsible managers of public funds and responsible actors in our communities. Unfortunately, despite several opportunities to do so, five banks failed to comply with the New York City Banking Commission’s designation process–leaving us to conclude that they are not taking meaningful actions to combat discrimination in their operations and are not responsible stewards of public dollars.” —NYC Comptroller Brad Lander in a May 25 statement.New York City banking commissions’ verdict, by the digits26: Banks that received approval at the first-ever Banking Commission public hearing, based on their non-discrimination practices, and stronger scrutiny for soundness in light of recent bank failures.

Racism has been an issue for black and brown Americans trying to join the financial system.🏘 Tenants worried about predatory lending practices by banks that jeopardize their rights and safe living conditions. It contributed to the downfall of the now-defunct Signature Bank.🌡️ Climate advocates who condemned banks that continued to lend billions of dollars for fossil-fuel expansion, ignoring their net-zero commitments.🏦 Frontline bank staff that faced illegal and abusive practices.🔫 People worried about bank operations contributing to gun manufacturing.The public airing of issues gave rise to “support for the idea of a public bank that would instead put those dollars to work for our communities,” Annie Levers, the city’s deputy comptroller for policy, said yesterday.The flip side: Texas and Florida penalized “woke” banksWhile New York City is featuring community reinvestment and fair credit practices in its criteria for monitoring financial institutions, some Red states are doing the opposite.For instance, two 2021 Texas bills bar state government entities from doing business with companies that discriminate against the firearm or ammunition industries, ones that prioritize Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies and boycott energy companies. In March this year, the Texas comptroller added HSBC to its “blacklist” over the bank’s refusal to fund new oil and gas projects.Earlier this month, Florida governor and 2024 Republican presidency hopeful Ron DeSantis signed into law a February bill that bars big banks, trusts, and other financial institutions from discriminating against customers for their religious, political, or social beliefs, “including their support for securing the border, owning a firearm, and increasing our energy independence,” as well as taking ESG out of consideration in all investment decisions at the state and local level. The law, set to go into effect on July 1, eliminates, in DeSantis’ words, an “ideological litmus test.”Related stories👩‍⚖️ Goldman Sachs is paying $215 million to settle a gender discrimination case and avoid an embarrassing trial🏠 Wells Fargo is getting sued for mortgage discrimination—again🚫 Texas blacklisted HSBC over the bank’s refusal to fund new oil and gas projectsMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) added to its rally from a day earlier, while Marvell Technology Group Ltd (NASDAQ:MRVL) surged 32% after estimating that revenue growth from artificial intelligence would at least double in fiscal 2024.Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) was also a big winner on the earnings front, rallying 12% after its quarterly results, released Thursday, showed improving margins.“[W]e believe that management execution within the core Old Navy banner is beginning to improve with better assortments and an improvement in market share gains in women’s and baby,” Goldman Sachs said in a note.Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), meanwhile, fell 13% after the beauty retailer’s cut to its margin outlook offset first-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.Still, the plunge in stock could prove short-term pain but long-term gain, UBS says, estimating that Ulta Beauty ""will resume an upward trajectory over the course of the year…as the market sees signs that it can maintain its double-digit EPS algo for an extended period.""In other news, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) gained 1% as the Wall Street bank reportedly cut about 500 jobs this week, CNBC reported, citing unnamed sources.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow ends week lower despite rally on debt-ceiling optimismUS jury says Google owes Sonos $32.5 million in smart-speaker patent caseFitch puts multiple US govt-linked securities on negative watch as debt deadline looms]"

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Ulta Beauty's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ulta Beauty is:63% = US$1.2b ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.63 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Ulta Beauty's Earnings Growth And 63% ROETo begin with, Ulta Beauty has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Ulta Beauty was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Ulta Beauty's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 27% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ULTA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Ulta Beauty Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Ulta Beauty doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Ulta Beauty's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Earnings Beat at Norfolk Southern in Q1Quarterly earnings (excluding $1.28 from non-recurring items) of $3.32 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.15 and improved 13.3% year over year.Railway operating revenues were $3,132 million in the quarter under review, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,099.8 million. The top line increased 7.5% year over year, with all key segments, including Merchandise and coal, registering improvements in revenues.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). CCEP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 15.98 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 21.26. Over the past year, CCEP's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.71 and as low as 12.05, with a median of 14.69.We should also highlight that CCEP has a P/B ratio of 3.72. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. CCEP's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 10.50. CCEP's P/B has been as high as 3.88 and as low as 2.35, with a median of 3.01, over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, CCEP looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

232,95f54482-e2fb-3d47-ab9d-a5e115633708,WY,2023-05-27,3 Housing Stocks That Will Crash as Housing Starts and Building Permits Plunge,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-housing-stocks-crash-housing-123833059.html,1684759113,STORY,"['TREX', 'WY', 'RKT']","[The U.S. economy experienced an unprecedented disruption over the past few years. Many sectors were caught up in the sudden stoppage of the economy in 2020, followed by an incredible boom thereafter. Housing stocks were among those that took part in this cycle, as people sought to upgrade their living conditions at record speed during the height of the pandemic.However, the housing boom appears to be coming to an end. Interest rates have soared over the past two years. This makes it much more expensive for potential home buyers to finance their purchases. Soaring inflation has pressured consumers’ wallets as well, offering an additional challenge for meeting larger monthly mortgage payments.This cold reality is starting to be reflected in the data. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, U.S. building permits tended to be in the 1.3-1.4 million range per month. This spiked to as high as 1.9 million per month in 2022 as homebuilders sought to cash in on the surge in prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNow, though, things are heading back to pre-2020 levels. April 2023 housing permits fell to 1.42 million, down dramatically from 1.82 million in April 2022. Given the recent trajectory, it’s possible housing permits will end up falling well below where they were in 2019 before the downturn ends. All this bodes poorly for these three housing stocks.RKTRocket Companies$8.16WYWeyerhaeuser$29.59TREXTrex$56.56Rocket Companies (RKT)The logo for Rocket Companies displayed on a smartphone screen (RKT).Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.comRocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) is one of the largest mortgage underwriters in America.It enjoyed a breathtaking period of success over the past few years. Revenues soared from $4.3 billion in 2018 to $15.9 billion in 2020. Rocket went public during this period, and quickly became a popular meme stock.However, as with other meme stocks, the prosperity wouldn’t last. As the pandemic-induced housing boom started to cool, and rising mortgage rates took their toll, Rocket’s revenues have collapsed.Story continuesFor 2022, revenues plunged to just $6.0 billion, down well over half from their 2020 peak. The numbers were grim. And, in 2023, analysts project another massive decline, with revenues set to slump to less than $4.0 billion.Rocket struggled to remain profitable in 2022. And with revenues continuing to plunge in 2023, expect a string of losses for Rocket this year. RKT stock is up 11% year-to-date, but I expect the stock to end up well in the red over the next few months.Weyerhaeuser (WY)Piles of 2x4s in a warehouseSource: shutterstockWeyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY) is one of the world’s largest timberland companies. It operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT), and investors tend to own this stock for its steady stream of dividends tied to the sale of lumber.The issue with Weyerhaeuser, and other such lumber REITs, is that demand for building materials has plummeted. This is reflected in the price of lumber.Lumber futures peaked at nearly $1,700 per 1,000 board feet back in 2021 at the height of the housing boom. Now, though, the price has collapsed to a meager $344, representing a more than 75% peak-to-trough decline.For a company that makes money selling lumber, this sort of decline will cause a major hit to earnings. WY stock will be fine in the long-run, and timberland has proven to generate acceptable returns through the full economic cycle. However, over the next couple of years, WY stock will likely struggle given the plunge in lumber prices and housing permits. Meanwhile, Weyerhaeuser’s 2.6% dividend yield isn’t high enough to adequately compensate investors compared to other REITs.Trex (TREX)two construction workers on a worksiteSource: ShutterstockThe slump in housing permits will also hit the building materials companies. Trex (NYSE:TREX) is among the housing stocks on this list that fit this category.Trex is a maker of decking, railings, and outdoor materials and components. It’s no secret that people spent a lot of money upgrading their homes during the pandemic, adding new decks and outdoor living spaces while cooped up at home.Now, though, Trex faces multiple headwinds. People are less likely to add additional decks and outdoor areas to their existing homes given the weakening economic conditions. And the sharp drop in building permits will limit demand for TREX products related to new home construction.Oddly enough, TREX stock is up nearly 30% year-to-date. Shares are now trading for more than 35-times forward earnings estimates. This is much too high a valuation, given the rapidly-weakening conditions in the housing industry.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company’s revenues are expected to grow year over year. Growing services subscriber base and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts for Apple’s prospects.However, Apple expects the March quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to that of the December quarter due to unfavorable forex. For iPhone, Apple expects the March quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate relative to the December quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth.For Mac and iPad, revenues are expected to decline in double digits on a year-over-year basis due to challenging comparison and macroeconomic headwinds. Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Chevron have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-10.1% vs. +1.7%). The company was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too.Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced. However, Chevron is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.

The company has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs. The company has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships.The company’s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential. On the flip side, pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, remains a concern.Global presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Buyout-related integration risks continues to remain a concern.

However, pricing pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 11.5% compared with the industry’s 1.4% growth so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 8.4% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $103.25 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 9.4% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.7% compares favorably with the industry’s (2.3%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Stryker’s Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book amid recovery in procedure-demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the platform’s unique and promising features. These developments, in turn, enable the company to sustain the momentum in robotic-treatment sales.SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako, whose installations touched record high during the fourth quarter. It remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in 2023, on the back of new launches and software upgrades. The first-quarter results reflected Stryker’s efforts to promote the advanced surgery platform.The company is focused on continued expansion of Mako and is progressing well with it in international markets. The initiatives reflect the demand for Stryker’s unique arm-assisted robotic technology.SYK also boasts a diversified product portfolio. The company’s wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil.Stryker’s significant exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence for healthcare and Medical Mechatronics have helped it to stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. The company’s portfolio includes Mako as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.Story continuesOn its first-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely affected last year due to COVID-19. Although hospital staffing pressure remains in certain regions, the company expects this problem to resolve gradually. This improvement, in turn, will likely lead to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, Stryker’s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the effect of the pandemic subsides. In first-quarter 2023, Stryker’s adjusted research and development expenses were 6.5% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. According to the company, this is likely to drive new product launches.In September 2022, SYK launched a new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System— for spine application. The Q Guidance system has shown promising launch uptake during the first quarter.Moreover, Stryker’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and lessen inflationary pressure look promising. The adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses during first-quarter 2023 were 35.6% of net sales, expanding 40 basis points year over year.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable currency rate fluctuation poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Vulcan Materials (VMC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this construction materials company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Vulcan is 7.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 26.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 15.1%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Vulcan is 17.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Vulcan have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 9.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Vulcan a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Vulcan is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

239,c3ac2572-d9c4-3433-8e8f-8bbcf3a6831f,GE,2023-05-27,General Electric (NYSE:GE) shareholders have earned a 36% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-nyse-ge-shareholders-110034766.html,1685185234,STORY,['GE'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), which is up 95%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 33% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 68% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for General Electric While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that General Electric has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of General Electric, it has a TSR of 154% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that General Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 68% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 5%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for UnitedHealth Group, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$30b ÷ (US$284b - US$116b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.5% it's much better. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for UnitedHealth Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for UnitedHealth Group.How Are Returns Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 90% in that time. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOn a side note, UnitedHealth Group's current liabilities are still rather high at 41% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Our Take On UnitedHealth Group's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 113% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.If you want to continue researching UnitedHealth Group, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

243,4eed0e14-2ef9-325f-bdfc-24026f16e544,UNH,2023-05-27,Column: This company made billions by surprise-billing helpless ER patients. Then justice arrived,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-company-made-billions-surprise-120021834.html,1684929621,STORY,['UNH'],"[Ambulances line up at Methodist Hospital's emergency department in Arcadia. Would your health plan pay for your ER care? (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)Some businesses deserve sympathy when they land in bankruptcy. Then there's Envision.The Tennessee company prospered as a provider of medical staff to hospitals around the country. It concentrated on emergency physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists for a simple reason: Their patients typically had no ability to pick and choose among these doctors when they need care.Waiting to be seen at the emergency room or already laid out on an operating table, the patients weren't in a position to ask whether the doctor was in their insurance plan's network.These higher payment rates [are] caused not by supply or demand, but rather by the ability to ""ambush"" the patient.""Zack Cooper et al, Yale UniversityThey might not even know they were seen by out-of-network doctors until they received a bill for their services — a surprise invoice for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.Envision's ""secret sauce was to pile medical debt on people with emergencies,"" says Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonprofit Washington think tank. ""That was purely taking advantage of people at their most vulnerable time.""Envision stands as a case study in the destructive incursion of the profit motive — actually, the profiteering motive — in American healthcare.Doctors themselves aren't the problem — they're disadvantaged themselves by financial pressures imposed by profit-seeking firms, which often require them to see more patients in a day and work without the best equipment.Surprise billing — sometimes known as ""balance billing"" — by Envision and other firms like it elicited so much public outrage that Congress was finally moved to do something about the practice. In 2020 it enacted the No Surprises Act, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2022.Envision wasn't alone in sticking patients with unexpected bills; another staffing firm, TeamHealth, is also struggling with the ramifications of the No Surprises Act.Story continuesThe act prohibited out-of-network providers who were not chosen by a patient from charging the patient more than the in-network reimbursement fee set by the patient's health plan. It forbade insurers to reject outright a patient's claim for service from an out-of-network doctor.Federal officials estimated that the law would apply to about 10 million unexpected bills a year. That figure didn't include beneficiaries of another provision, which outlawed the very sleazy practice by some big insurers of rejecting an emergency-room claim because a patient's condition didn't turn out to be a true emergency.The No Surprises Act blew a sizable hole in Envision's profit-and-loss statement — part of ""a whiplash-inducing onslaught of obstacles and complications"" facing the firm's management, its bankruptcy filing stated.Read more: Column: America's decline in life expectancy speaks volumes about our problemsAmong other elements of the ""onslaught"" the firm cited was the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced non-emergency hospital visits by as much as 70% because patients deferred elective surgeries; an increase in salaries for professionals as the pandemic prompted older clinicians to retire; and a billing backlash by its largest payer, UnitedHealth Group.Envision, which provides staff for more than 500 facilities in 45 states, said in its bankruptcy filing that the pandemic cost it some $795 million in operating revenue (technically, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA) in 2020 and 2021.UnitedHealth's ""uniquely aggressive"" pushback on reimbursements, Envision said, cost it more than $400 million in EBITDA over the last five years. Envision says that if UnitedHealth merely paid what Envision claims it owes, it would not have had to file for bankruptcy. Overall, the company's EBITDA went from about $1 billion before the pandemic to about $250 million last year.In any case, the No Surprises Act was the factor that hit Envision's business model below the water line.It's worthwhile, then, to take a closer look at what this firm and its owner, the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., have been up to, and why we should celebrate the modest change in the American healthcare system represented by the act. (TeamHealth is owned by another private equity firm, Blackstone.)Private equity firms acquire businesses typically through leveraged buyouts, in which the acquisition is financed largely through borrowings to be paid back out of the acquired business' revenues. Generally, their goal is to cash out by selling the business or taking it public within about five years.The firms first showed interest in healthcare businesses in the 1990s, initially focusing on nursing homes and hospitals because of their reliable cash flows, as a Brookings Institution study outlined in 2021. By 2010, the private equity firms had moved on to urgent care clinics, ambulance services, and emergency departments and hospital services such as anesthesiology and radiology ""that could utilize surprise out-of-network billing,"" Brookings found.Read more: Column: Eli Lilly is slashing insulin prices, but hold your applauseAccording to a 2018 Yale University study that heavily influenced the legislative movement in Congress, it wasn't unusual for emergency doctors to end their network contract with insurers. On average, the Yale researchers reported, out-of-network physicians charged more than twice the going in-network insurance reimbursements and more than six times the standard reimbursements from Medicare.The study in effect pointed the finger at the physician staffing firms, Envision (known at the time as EmHealth) and TeamHealth. ""Both firms profit from the fact that out-of-network physicians working in in-network hospitals cannot be avoided by patients."" The runup in charges, the researchers wrote, ""undercuts the functioning of healthcare labor markets, exposes patients to significant financial risk, and reduces social welfare.""""These higher payment rates"" charged by out-of-network physicians, the Yale study said, are ""caused not by supply or demand, but rather by the ability to 'ambush' the patient."" The practice raised the cost of healthcare generally.The Yale researchers made passing mention of another player in this process: the health insurance industry, which has an interest in paying providers as little as it can get away with. (UnitedHealth, as it happens, provided the researchers with the data they used for their study, leading to accusations that the study favored the health plans' point of view; the researchers said UnitedHealth had no influence on their findings.)Insurers reacted to the charges from out-of-network doctors by paying only a portion of their bills. That prompted doctors to try to obtain the balance by billing the patients. The surprise billing scandal was born.Envision says it started to phase out surprise or balance billing in 2020, even before the No Surprises Act was passed and signed — though congressional action against the practice was in the wind long before that.It says its real problem is that regulations implementing the act have put health insurers in the driver's seat in setting reimbursements. Provider firms have to go to arbitration to settle their differences, but that's resulted in a logjam of arbitration cases and a backup of unpaid claims.Private equity investors had long had their eyes on Envision, which was founded in 1992. The firm oscillated between private and public ownership, as a succession of investors sought to squeeze it for profits.The process started in 2005, when Onyx Capital acquired it through a leveraged buyout and took it public the same year. The investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice acquired it in 2011 for $3.2 billion and staged an initial public offering two years later.Soon after that, EmHealth merged with Amsurg, a physician staffing service for ambulatory surgical centers — that is, those unaffiliated with hospitals. The result was Envision, which became the largest physician staffing firm in the country.Read more: Column: Moderna and Pfizer are jacking up the price of COVID vaccines. The government should stop themKohlberg Kravis Roberts entered the scene in 2018 with a $9.9-billion leveraged buyout, in which the firm and its partners invested $3.5 billion. That stake was wiped out in the bankruptcy, which followed lengthy and extremely complex negotiations with creditors that included Newport Beach-based Pimco.The prearranged bankruptcy will allow both Amsurg and Envision to continue operating under the ownership of their creditors, who will take over once the latter emerges from bankruptcy in the fall. Among the new owners will be Blackstone, giving the big private equity firm a foothold in the two biggest staffing companies, Envision and TeamHealth.The No Surprises Act did little to remedy the dysfunction of American healthcare. If anything, it underscored the insanity of a system that locks providers and payers in never-ending conflict over who owes what to whom and for which services.Envision and UnitedHealth waged this war for years. The two parties let their last network contract expire in January 2021, after which they continued to snipe at each other over reimbursements until last September, when they served each other with lawsuits.Envision says UnitedHealth has consistently low-balled its reimbursements ever since the contract expiration — in fact, it says Envision allowed the contract to lapse because it wouldn't accept UnitedHealth's ""unconscionable take-it-or-leave-it reimbursement offer.""The insurer, for its part, says Envision has ""systematically"" upcoded its reimbursement claims. The allegation is that Envision has submitted claims for more elaborate patient treatments — which warrant higher reimbursements — than the patients needed or received at the ER.(Envision won a $91-million arbitration award from UnitedHealth in March, but that dispute concerned reimbursements owed in 2017 and 2018, while the firms' network contract was in effect.)It's tempting to declare a plague on both their houses, to quote ""Romeo and Juliet,"" but the problem is systemic. It's grounded in ""the tension between profit maximization by firms that own healthcare providers, and the best care possible for patients that providers are obligated to provide,"" Appelbaum has observed.The No Surprises Act addressed one symptom of that tension, the practice of sticking unwary patients with unexpected bills. But it didn't lay a finger on the underlying disease. Americans spend vastly more on medical care than residents of any other developed country, and have worse health outcomes.One reason is the endless, costly dickering among middlemen like Envision and UnitedHealth to make sure they get their share of the bucks sloshing around in the system. Every segment of the healthcare industry also spends heavily on lobbyists in Washington to ensure they don't get shut out of the party.Who doesn't have lobbyists? The patients. The No Surprises Act is one of the very few victories they've ever notched in this battle, and they shouldn't expect to see many more.Get the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$343b last week. However, the 0.3% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Procter &amp; Gamble, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Procter &amp; Gamble, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Procter &amp; Gamble. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.6% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$195m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 34% stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Horton DHI, have all displayed relative strength, handily outperforming the general market. This is illustrated in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those interested in tapping into the recent momentum, let’s take a closer look at each.NVRNVR is engaged in constructing and selling single-family detached homes, townhomes, and condominium buildings. Analysts have increased their earnings expectations across nearly all timeframes, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVR shares aren’t stretched regarding valuation, with the current 13.3X forward earnings multiple sitting well beneath the 15.1X five-year median and the Zacks Construction sector average.The stock carries a Style Score of “B.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchD.R.

246,b648a693-6b8f-3056-8121-4bdd2906af18,DHI,2023-05-27,Home Builder Stocks Could Be Strong for Years to Come,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-builder-stocks-could-strong-165100919.html,1685119860,STORY,"['DHI', 'PHM']","[The home builder industry has firmly established itself as one of the leading sectors in the stock market, delivering a remarkable performance over the past year. Home builders currently sit in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank, with 10 stocks scoring a Zacks Rank #1.Fueled by a confluence of factors, including a persistent scarcity in housing supply and a decline in interest rates over the last year, the industry has enjoyed an upward trajectory with no signs of slowing down. This was a huge surprise for many on Wall Street, as most analysts projected a recession at the beginning of the year, which should have challenged the sector.Furthermore, bolstered by improving earnings estimates and reasonable valuations, home builder stocks appear as compelling investments, with strong return potential for investors. Although there are a number of stocks in the sector with convincing fundamentals, I will focus on D.R. Horton DHI, PulteGroup PHM, and NVR NVR, which have all outperformed the market YTD and over the last decade.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchD.R. HortonAfter experiencing some aggressive downgrades in the second half of 2022, DHI is back to being upgraded again. D.R. Horton boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates have been revised 20-30% higher across timeframes over the last two months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNot only is DHI a steady grower, and well positioned in the current housing environment, but management is also generous with returning cash to shareholders. DHI has a dividend yield of 1%, which has been increased by an average of 15% annually over the last five years. Additionally, over the last five years, the share count has been reduced by 10% thanks to stock buy-back programs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDHI is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 10.2x, which is in line with the industry average, and below its 10-year median of 11.6x. Additionally, the industry itself is below its 10-year median of 11.1x.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVRNVR is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) home builder stock, with upward trending earnings revisions. In the chart below we can see just how severe the revisions lower were going into the end of 2022, and how strongly they have rebounded this year. It should be noted that estimates are still below what they were a year ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnlike other homebuilders, NVR’s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry.NVR acquires finished lots at market prices from various third-party land developers under the Lot Purchase Agreements so that the legal obligation and economic loss is limited to the amount of the deposit, in case of failure.The lot acquisition strategy helps the company to avoid financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. This strategy allows it to gain efficiency and a competitive edge over its peers.NVR has managed to expand Net Margins considerably over the last ten years, in part thanks to this strategy. Over that time margins have nearly tripled from 6% to 16%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVR is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 13.3x, which is above the industry average 9.8x, but below its 10-year median of 16x. However, with its unique acquisition strategy, and high margins, NVR likely earns a premium valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPulteGroupPulteGroup stock is blasting to new all-time highs as well. After being downgraded through the end of 2022, investors are now caught flat-footed as earnings estimates are revised higher and the stock charges higher. Pulte also enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting the strong trend in earnings estimates upgrades.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPHM is very generous with its investors as well, making huge efforts to return cash to shareholders. In addition to reducing its share count by 40% over the last ten years though buybacks, PHM also offers a dividend which is has raised every year since 2012. The dividend payment has been increased by an average of 12% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPHM is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 7.7x, which is well below the industry average 10.3x, and below its 10-year median of 10.4x. This is an attractive valuation for a company with a long history of growing sales, returning cash to shareholders, and benefiting from secular tightness in its respective market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInterest RatesIn the chart below of the Ten-Year Treasury yield, we can see that interest rates peaked back in November 2022 and have trended lower since. If you compare this chart with the home builder stocks, you will see that home builders began to rally exactly when rates peaked. This isn’t surprising as lower mortgage rates lead to more home buying.Additionally, we can now be relatively confident that interest rates will continue to trend lower because of rhetoric from the Federal Reserve. After raising interest rates 5% since 2021, the Fed has now made it clear that they are close to, if not completely done raising interest rates. Lower rates mean cheaper mortgages, which should encourage further strength in home buying.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewHousing SupplyAnyone that has tried buying a house in the last two years knows just how competitive the market has been. And anyone that hasn’t tried buying a home has read about it or spoken to someone that has. Besides several markets that were exceptionally hot during the post-Covid boom, most local real estate markets have remained extremely supply constrained.The housing boom and bust of 2008 had something of a traumatic effect on housing developers, because since then housing supply has collapsed. Even in more recent years we can see that the amount of active real estate listings has more than halved in the last five years. Because of this, home builders and their products are an extremely hot commodity.St Louis FedImage Source: St Louis FedBottom LineEven after the strong run up in the industry, home builder stocks are still compelling investments. High Zacks Ranks and technical chart patterns make them strong near-term investment candidates. While secular tailwinds, and low valuations make them very attractive long-term investments. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues also beat the consensus mark and increased year over year, owing to upbeat traffic volumes.American Airlines AAL was also in the news, courtesy of its agreement in principle with its pilot union, Allied Pilots Association. Meanwhile, AAL’s Northeast Alliance with JetBlue Airways JBLU ran into rough weather following a court ruling to end the partnership. Delta Air Lines DAL also grabbed headlines courtesy of its decision to appoint a new chief operating officer.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. Ryanair reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) loss of 73 cents per share (excluding a penny from non-recurring items), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents. In the year-ago reported quarter, RYAAY had incurred a loss of 98 cents per share. Revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,908.7 million. Revenues improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes.On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY’s profit after tax was €1.42 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 against a net loss of €355 million incurred a year ago. Ryanair expects traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 185 million.Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents 15,000 plus pilots at AAL, reached an agreement in principle with the company. If the collective bargaining agreement materializes, American Airlines pilots would be eligible for a 21% pay raise this year. Further details will be available shortly.3. American Airlines and JetBlue received a major setback when a federal judge ordered the companies to terminate their alliance in the Northeast as it was anti-competitive. The verdict is in line with the Justice Department’s opinion. The Justice Department’s antitrust suit, filed more than a year ago, accused the alliance of stifling competition. The judge ordered the companies to end the alliance within 30 days of the ruling. Both carriers are likely to challenge the decision. In fact, AAL’s management said that the ruling will not impact its earnings performance.Story continues4. Delta announced that it will get a new chief operating officer from Jun 12. This Atlanta-based carrier appointed Mike Spanos for the new role. Spanos has more than two decades of work experience and has been associated with many big companies.

To ensure the utmost reliability and accuracy of our findings, we extensively researched data from trusted sources such as The United States Geological Survey (USGS). By utilizing production percentages from E3S Web of Conferences, we calculated the production output of France and Germany specifically for the year 2020.  We then ranked the countries in ascending order according to their actual Rhenium production quantities, measured in metric tons. 10. ArmeniaMetric Tons: 0.26Armenia is known for its significant production of the rare metal Rhenium, especially for aerospace and defense industries utilization. The country's major Rhenium production is concentrated from the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine. Armenia's geological conditions and its abundant reserves of copper and molybdenum make it an ideal location for the production of Rhenium. The country's Rhenium production has played a vital role in boosting its economy and making it a significant player in the global metals market.9. KazakhstanMetric Tons: 1Kazakhstan's Rhenium production remained consistent at 1 metric ton in both 2015 and 2016, and this level was maintained in 2021 as well. The country implements a Rhenium recovery process that involves utilizing a sulphuric acid scrubbing solution. A noteworthy aspect of Kazakhstan's Rhenium production is the copper concentrates discovered in Zhezkazgan, which contain up to 30 grams per ton (g/t) of Rhenium.These deposits are globally recognized as the richest known sources of Rhenium. The abundance of Rhenium in these copper concentrates highlights the significant role played by Kazakhstan in meeting the demand for this valuable element, which finds applications in various industrial sectors.8. ChinaMetric Tons: 2.5Many producers in China have traditionally used the Kennecott Process for Rhenium extraction; there is an exception with Jiangxi Copper Corporation. The Kennecott Process has been widely used in the industry for over 40 years to extract Rhenium.In this process, exhaust gasses from the molybdenum roasting circuit are washed with water to produce perrhenic acid. The solution is then treated with chemicals like NaOH and Ca(ClO)2 to remove contaminants and adjust the pH. The solution undergoes ion exchange processing, where a resin adsorbs the Rhenium, which is later stripped using hydrochloric acid. The recovered Rhenium can further undergo purification steps, including recrystallization.Jiangxi Copper Corporation, which was the largest Rhenium producer in China in 2016, has developed and implemented its own production process. Their method includes solvent extraction of the scrubbing liquid, stripping of the organic solvent, purification, and crystallization of NH4ReO4, resulting in a Rhenium yield of up to 92%. Therefore, while the majority of Chinese producers employ the Kennecott Process, Jiangxi Copper Corporation has adopted a different approach to Rhenium recovery.7. Republic of KoreaMetric Tons: 2.8According to USGS, the Republic of Korea produced approximately 2.8 metric tons of Rhenium in 2020 and 2021. South Korea's production of Rhenium underscores its industrial prowess and technological advancements. The country's emphasis on innovation and research has enabled it to become a key player in the global supply chain of this valuable metal. With a focus on meeting market demands and supporting various sectors, South Korea continues to contribute significantly to the production and availability of Rhenium worldwide.6. FranceMetric Tons: 4.24In 2020, France produced approximately 4.24 tons of Rhenium. The country has emerged as one of the leading producers of Rhenium products within Western Europe. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the expansion of the aerospace industry, a thriving automotive sector, increased applications in the biomedical field, and the utilization of Rhenium powder and salt crystals. These factors have collectively contributed to the notable increase in Rhenium production within France.Click to continue reading and see Rhenium Production by Country: Top 5 Countries.Suggested Articles:10 Best Gold Royalty Stocks to Buy Now10 Small-Cap Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Avoiding12 Best Silver Mining Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: none.

With one episode to go, it’s still anyone’s game. Will Kendall, Logan’s firstborn from his second marriage and, at one point, heir apparent, take up the crown? Will his sister Shiv succeed in her machinations? Has youngest sibling Roman blown it? Could it be a wild card like Connor? Does cousin Greg stand a chance? Will Shiv’s husband, Tom Wambsgans, achieve the seemingly impossible? Or will conglomerate Waystar fall into new, foreign hands, leaving billions in the Roy family’s pockets but no control?Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesSuccession’s tribulations add dramatic flair and intrigue to a delicate process that most corporate giants eventually have to face. The question of CEO succession has recently hounded business leaders like Tesla’s Elon Musk, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, and Pepsico’s Indra Nooyi before them. Here’s how they’ve tackled it.Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman: “No plans to go out like Logan Roy”Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman attends the Reuters NEXT Newsmaker event in New York City, New York, U.S., December 1, 2022.Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said he had identified three potential successor to his 13-year run at the Wall Street bank. “I definitely have no plans to go out like Logan Roy,” he quipped earlier this month, referring to the Succession character’s inability to clearly pick out a successor. Gorman plans to step down within the next 12 months but stay on as executive chairman.JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon: “When I don’t have this kind of intensity, I should leave”Jamie Dimon, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., poses for a photo during an interview with Reuters in Miami, Florida, U.S., February 8, 2023. Gorman’s announcement naturally put the spotlight on another Wall Street veteran, Jamie Dimon, who’s been at JPMorgan’s helm for the past 17 years. He plans to keep going for at least another three years, or for however long he can: “I can’t do this forever, I know that, but my intensity is the same. When I don’t have this kind of intensity, I should leave,” he said at the bank’s investor day on May 22. JPMorgan indicated in a regulatory filing earlier this year that the company’s succession plan is underway and, for the time being, chief operating officer Daniel Pinto can step in should the need suddenly arise.Story continuesTesla’s Elon Musk: “Succession is one of the toughest age-old problems”Twitter, X Corp., and Tesla CEO Elon Musk poses prior to his talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Monday, May 15, 2023 at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France. Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk recently found a successor to take over as CEO at the social media platform, but the succession plan at Tesla, a publicly listed company worth nearly $590 billion, is one that concerns shareholders. “Succession is one of the toughest age-old problems. It’s plagued countries, kings and CEOs since the dawn of history,” Musk mused while chatting to the Wall Street Journal this week.Musk has yet to publicly indicate a successor at the electric car maker and has no intention to step down any time soon. Nonetheless, Tesla board member James Murdoch (yes, of the News Corp Murdochs, one of the families that inspired Succession) testified last year there is a succession plan in place, and Musk confirmed as much: “The board is aware of who my recommendation is. It’s up to them. They may choose to go different direction.”One thing Musk knows for sure, he wouldn’t go down the Roys’ “keep it in the family” scenario. “I’m definitely not of the school of automatically giving my kids some share of the companies, even if they have no interest or inclination or ability to manage the companies. I think that’s a mistake,” he said.PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi: “I’m still in the chair”Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, takes part in a panel during the Women In The World Summit in the Manhattan borough of New York April 8, 2016.Indra Nooyi started facing questions about succession plans a few years into her CEO stint at PepsiCo, where she had started working in 1994 before getting the top job in 2006. By 2012, PepsiCo was facing pressure to work on a transition, and by 2014, analysts were asking for an update on that front. In a call, Nooyi explained that the company had it all under control but, she added: “Let me reassure you, at this point, I’m still in the chair.”Nooyi’s confident response did not end the succession chatter. In the end, she stepped down in 2018, becoming one of the longest-serving female CEOs of a Fortune 500 company. But as the succession plan did not involve the elevation of another woman, her replacement with Ramon Laguarta felt like a setback for gender equality.HP’s Meg Whitman: “Succession planning is absolutely essential”Meg Whitman speaks onstage at Women's Forum Of New York Breakfast Of Corporate Champions on November 07, 2019 in New York City.In 2011, former eBay CEO and failed Californian gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman became HP’s third top executive in as many years. Whitman has been championing the importance of a well-crafted succession plan ever since, calling it “absolutely essential” at a 2014 Fortune event, and expressing a preference for internal candidates. “I promised the board, the next CEO of HP Enterprise has to come from inside the company, not come from outside and learn five different businesses,” she said.A year later, HP split into two, and Whitman went with the HP Enterprise (HPE) business as CEO. By the time she announced her departure, effective February 2018, HPE had a successor waiting in the wings: president Antonio Neri, who is still at the company’s helm.GM’s Mary Barra: “I plan on being here for a while”Mary Barra, Chair and CEO of General Motors Company speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 2, 2022.Mary Barra became the first woman to lead a US automaker when she was appointed CEO of General Motors in 2014. On that front, she has no successors, as she remains the only female leader of a US car brand. And on her company’s front, there is no public chatter about finding her heir. “Don’t write me off; I plan on being here for a while,” she told the Detroit Free Press last year.Disney’s Bob Iger: “Succession is pretty much at the top of the list”Robert Iger, Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, attends the 95th Annual Academy Awards on March 12, 2023 in Hollywood, California. Bob Iger represents a cautionary tale on what happens when a succession plan doesn’t work out. His failure to find a successor the first time around was seen as one his biggest mistakes as CEO. Iger joined the ranks of boomerang CEOs last year, when he announced his return at the helm of Disney, a company he had led from 2005 to 2020. His return came with a caveat: he’d only stay on for two years.

With a median follow-up of six months, patients who received the recommended 200mg dose of linvoseltamab showed a 71% objective response rate (“ORR”). This includes 59% patients achieving very good partial response (“VGPR”) or better and 30% patients achieving a complete response (“CR”) or stringent complete response (“sCR”). Management also announced that the median progression-free survival was not reached.Treatment benefit with linvoseltamab was also observed across prespecified subgroups, including patients with high disease burden and aggressive disease.Based on these results, Regeneron initiated a phase III development program to evaluate linvoseltamab in earlier stages of multiple myeloma. Management plans to use the data from the above study to support its regulatory submission with the FDA for linvoseltamab in multiple myeloma indication later this year.The above results were part of the secondary endpoint assessed by a local investigator. The primary endpoint of the study, i.e., ORR assessed by an independent review committee, which will be available when the data are more mature.In the year so far, Regeneron’s shares have moved up 0.5% against the industry’s 9.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn a separate press release, Regeneron announced positive data from a phase I study evaluating the combination of its investigational LAG-3 inhibitor fianlimab and PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in adults with advanced melanoma. Data from the study exhibited ORRs ranging from 56-63% across three independent cohorts of advanced melanoma patients. Based on these encouraging results, management plans to evaluate this combination in phase III studies in the advanced and adjuvant melanoma settings. This fianlimab-Libtayo combination is already being evaluated in an ongoing phase II/III studies in non-small cell lung cancer and research in other solid tumors.Story continuesRegeneron’s top line is being driven by a couple of blockbuster drugs like Eylea and Dupixent, which account for nearly half of its total revenues. A successful development and potential commercialization of its pipeline drugs will help the company lower its dependence on the drugs for generating revenue.Regeneron’s lead drug, Eylea, is approved for various ophthalmology indications like wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).Dupixent is jointly marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi SNY under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the drug’s global sales. The Sanofi-partnered drug is approved in the United States and Europe for five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying Dupixent in late-stage studies in a broad range of diseases driven by type II inflammation, like bullous pemphigoid and chronic spontaneous urticaria.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Gap’s report comes after its peers, Urban Outfitters Inc. (NASDAQ: URBN), Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) also largely exceeded earnings expectations this week. But Gap’s shares surged about 15% upon news as gross margins have improved. This is a positive wave after earlier apparel such as the one from Foot Locker (NYSE: FL) who has major fixes to do if it wants to prevent being crushed by the leading seller of apparel and footwear in the U.S., no other than the e-commerce titan itself Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).First Quarter Key FiguresFor the quarter ended on April 29th, Gap reported revenue of $3.28 billion, translating to a decline of 6% YoY with comparable sales declining by 3% across Gap’s four brands and store sales dropping 4% compared to last year’s comparable quarter. As sales go back to ‘pre-pandemic’ trends, online sales, which made up 37% of total net sales, dropped 9% YoY. Even its peer Foot Locker Inc (NYSE: FL) showed with its latest results it desperately needs a better digital game as it competes not only with Amazon but all brands that sell their merchandise directly to customers, such as Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE).But when compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2019, they rose as much as 39%.View more earnings on GPSCompared to last year’s comparable quarter when Gap lost $162 million, or 44 cents a share, net loss narrowed to $18 million, or 5 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $3 million, or 1 cent per share.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Has EvolvedAfter surpassing analyst expectations both for its quarterly results and guidance, the apparel retailer showed it successfully changed the identity of its brand from “T shirt and jeans” to lifestyle choice as millennials are purchasing its clothing for their return to the office. Net sales grew 2.9% YoY to $836 million to $814.4 million with brand comparable sales rising 14%. Unlike Gap’s relatively unchanged guidance, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch expects full year net sales growth in the range between 2% and 4%, with second quarter sales being off to a great start.Story continuesUrban Outfitters Benefitted From a More Stable Supply ChainUnlike Foot Locker whose margins got dented by promotions, Urban Outfitters managed to control its promotions and as a result, its margins increased 2.6 percentage points owed to higher merchandise markups driven by lower freight costs. During the quarter that ended on April 30th, sales rose 6% YoY to $1.11 billion and resulted in a net income of $52.82 million, or 56 cents a share, which is an impressive improvement from last year’s comparable quarter when Urban Outfitters made $31.53 million, or 33 cents a share.Gap Needs To Work On A New Brand IdentityAll in all, results show that cost-cutting measures are resulting in improved performance. Lower air freight expenses, less reliance on discounts and promotions who harm margins, a reduced headcount and trimmed expenses have all contributed to the improvement but the above results also suggest that the Gap eeds to go beyond cost cutting to reposition itself for long-term growth, like its peer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. But when it comes to a business where someone like Amazon is leading the way, without even counting on physical stores, this is a daunting task. Like Foot Locker, Gap needs to encourage loyalty of its customers and make its brand image appealing to their lifestyles as otherwise it risks being smashed by comeptitors, including Amazon. It certainly does not help that with its empire and smart algorithms, Amazon is even disrupting the concept of a personal style. Gap management acknowledges this need for a critical change and continues its path towards improving its business by concrete actions, such as conducting research to better understand its consumers. But is it able to pull it off in a world where Amazon is constantly upleveling its game is a whole other story.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

GPS jumped more than 13% in the after-market session on May 25, following the first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also improved year over year. However, the top line lagged the consensus mark and declined year over year.Results were hurt by uncertain macro and consumer environments. On the flip side, share gains at Old Navy and Gap brands, adjusted operating margin expansion, reduction in inventory, and a strong balance sheet acted as tailwinds.In the past three months, shares of the company have plunged 43.4% compared with the industry’s 18.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 DetailsFor the fiscal first quarter, adjusted earnings of a penny per share which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents. The metric compared favorably with a loss of 44 cents reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Net sales declined 6% year over year to $3,276 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,288 million.

Meanwhile, the metric jumped 40% from the pre-pandemic levels. Store sales moved down 4% year over year.Brand-Wise Sales &amp; CompsOld Navy: Net sales at Old Navy Global fell 1% year over year to $1,828 million due to continued softness in the active and kid's categories, as well as muted demand from lower-income consumers, somewhat offset by continued strength in the women's category. Sales grew 2% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. The metric surpassed our estimate of $1,740.8 million. Comps also declined 1% year over year.Gap Global: For first-quarter fiscal 2023, net sales declined 13% year over year to $692 million due to unfavorable impact from the sale of Gap China, the shutdown of Yeezy Gap and currency headwinds. The metric missed our estimate of $794.7 million. Comps increased 1% year over year.Banana Republic: Net sales decreased 10% to $432 million, whereas comps fell 8% year over year. Segmental results were hurt by last year’s brand-lapped outsized growth, driven by the shift in consumer preferences. Sales lagged our estimate of $447.5 million.Athleta: Net sales edged down 11% to $321 million for the Athleta brand, whereas comps fell 13% year over year. Sales in this brand grew 45% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Segmental results were hurt by continued product acceptance challenges. Net sales beat our estimate of $313.1 million.Story continuesMargins &amp; CostsThe adjusted gross margin of 37.2% expanded 570 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 610-bps rise in adjusted merchandise margins, stemming from lower airfreight and inflationary headwinds.The adjusted operating loss was $18 million in the reported quarter, excluding a $47 million gain related to the sale of an office building and $75 million of restructuring costs. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin expanded 620 bps to 0.5%, driven by improved gross margin stemming from reduced air freight expense and improved promotional activity, as well as adjusted SG&amp;A leverage.Adjusted SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, leveraged 60 basis points to 36.6%, owing to lower advertising expenses and lower technology investments resulting from cost-saving actions.Other FinancialsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,170 million, up from $845 million in the year-ago period. As of Apr 29, 2023, it had total stockholders’ equity of $2,185 million and long-term debt of $1,487 million.As of Apr 29, the company generated $15 million in cash from operating activities.

The company continues to anticipate fiscal 2023 sales to decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range compared to last year's reported figure of $15.6 billion. The view also includes a 53rd week, which is estimated to positively impact sales by $150 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, it expects sales to decrease in the mid to high-single-digit range compared to last year's reported figure of $3.86 billion. This view includes approximately $60 million in sales for Gap China. Also, the fiscal second-quarter and fiscal 2023 gross margins are envisioned to expand year over year.

We have also provided additional filters for candidates to focus on the jobs that align with their career path.Improved filtering of jobs makes it easier to sort jobs by:Top matches (also indicated by a fire symbol)Technical or Non-technical jobsRemote opportunitiesBy date postedBy locationStory continuesThere are new options to adjust how opportunities are viewed, giving candidates more control over how matches are displayed.Optimizing Opportunity SortingOrganizing opportunities is important for a job search and symbols are key to this task. One new feature is our fire symbol which indicates a ""hot/top"" match where extra skills were met on top of the base required ones indicated by the employer. We've also added the capability to heart or x positions, so it is more efficient to sort through positions and categorize them for additional follow-up or not interested buckets. These sorting symbols are interconnected with tabs, a newly released feature. These tabs provide easy access to Saved and Not Interested job lists.Accessibility ImprovementsA core focus this past year was to improve accessibility to the platform. Using a collaborative method with our own Cisco experts and development team for the platform, we were able to achieve our foundational goal in this capacity. For example, we have improved keyboard and color accessibility among other features. We are committed to continuing this effort and have incorporated accessibility compatibility as a checkpoint for future features.Showcasing Credly BadgesMany of our candidates, especially our Cisco Networking Academy community, have Credly badges to share on their profile. One of our new features on the Matching Engine platform allows all candidates to add their Credly badges to their user profile. This allows recruiters to view these achievements beside certifications on candidate profiles.Our goal through these updates is to make our platform more accessible as well as compatible for our candidate communities as they are searching for job opportunities.We work closely with our employers, Cisco Partners, and Cisco Customers and they have conveyed they are eager to hire talented individuals from various walks of life.
