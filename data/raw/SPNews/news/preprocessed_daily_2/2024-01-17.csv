Through an uneven environment with shifting views on the trajectory of the U.S. economy, persistent geopolitical unrest, and a temporary disruption within the regional banking sector, our ""no trade-offs"" value proposition continued to resonate with investors. Clients entrusted us with $306 billion in core net new assets during the year, including over $43 billion in December alone. This ongoing success with clients helped push total client assets to a record $8.52 trillion at year-end. Additionally, we welcomed 977 thousand new-to-firm retail households as well as 315 advisors-in-transition to Schwab. In total, we added 3.8 million new brokerage accounts to increase our total client base to 34.8 million accounts.""', '""Maintaining sustained investment in our clients allows our modern wealth management offering to evolve with their needs,"" added Mr. Bettinger. ""The primary objective coming into 2023 was a successful Ameritrade conversion. By the end of the year, we had transitioned approximately 90% of client assets and accounts with no significant disruptions. The overall feedback from both retail investors and Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) has been overwhelmingly positive – and when there were minor issues, we addressed most concerns immediately. The entire leadership team is grateful for the tireless efforts of our employees, whose diligent planning has put us in a position to complete the largest integration in our industry’s history, with deal-related attrition tracking better than our initial expectations.""', '""While the Ameritrade client conversion garnered a lot of attention and significant resources, we also made substantial progress across our key strategic initiatives of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, and client segmentation. We took steps to unlock incremental efficiency, including identifying at least $500 million in cost savings beyond the pre-committed Ameritrade synergies. As part of this effort, we reduced our workforce by approximately 6% of staff, which helped streamline the organization and enables us to prioritize investments in key client initiatives. Enhancements to our personalized investing and wealth management solutions demonstrated progress on our win-win monetization efforts. Net flows into our managed investing solutions totaled $33 billion, a 29% increase versus the previous year, supported by record flows into Schwab Wealth Advisory™ and Wasmer Schroeder™ Strategies. We also saw building momentum within Schwab Personalized Indexing® and launched Schwab Investing Themes™. We improved digital capabilities for RIAs, including a new account onboarding workflow and an expedited origination process for our Pledged Asset Line® product. Finally, recognizing that certain client segments often have different needs, we announced new curated experiences for our high net worth and trader clients. Creating more tailored experiences for these individuals helps ensure they are getting the most from their relationship with Schwab.""', 'Mr. Bettinger finished, ""As we move forward with our key initiatives, we remain as confident as ever in our ""Through Clients’ Eyes"" strategy. Our client focus has guided our culture and operating priorities for five decades and we believe it keeps us best positioned to sustain long-term profitable growth into the future.""', 'CFO Peter Crawford stated, ""Schwab’s financial performance during 2023 reflected the challenges of navigating a market environment shaped by the Federal Reserve’s pronounced interest rate tightening policy and the follow-on effects stemming from the regional banking crisis in March. Total net revenues were down 9% versus prior year levels to $18.8 billion, as client cash realignment activity impacted our net interest revenue. The benefits of rising rates were more than offset by lower interest-earning assets and increased utilization of higher-cost supplemental funding, driving net interest revenue down 12% year-over-year to $9.4 billion. Asset management and administration fees rose to a record $4.8 billion, bolstered by rebounding equity markets as well as strong client interest in purchased money fund products and advisory solutions. A slightly different trading mix and softer volumes led trading revenue to decline 12% to $3.2 billion. On the expense front, GAAP spending grew by 10% to $12.5 billion to facilitate the Ameritrade integration, make investments across our strategic initiatives, and capture incremental cost savings of approximately $500 million that will be realized in 2024. Restructuring costs required to effect these savings totaled $495 million, while acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangibles were $401 million and $534 million, respectively. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses (1) increased by 6% to $11.0 billion, approximately 2% of which reflected the $172 million FDIC special assessment. Together, the combination of our diversified revenue model and rigorous expense discipline enabled us to generate a 33.9% pre-tax profit margin for the full-year, or 41.5% on an adjusted basis (1). These results represent the 11th consecutive year of GAAP pre-tax margins exceeding 30% and the', '5th consecutive year of an adjusted pre-tax margin above 40%.""', '""Throughout 2023, our approach to balance sheet management continued to prioritize flexibility,"" Mr. Crawford added. ""We opportunistically raised $6.2 billion in senior notes to prepare for upcoming maturities as well as provide additional liquidity during the larger Ameritrade conversion weekends. While the pace of rate increases slowed substantially during the year, the upper bound of the Fed Funds target range still climbed to 5.50%. As expected, clients took advantage of the highest yields in nearly two decades by increasing their allocations to investment cash and fixed income alternatives available at Schwab. These movements caused Schwab’s balance sheet to shrink by $59 billion, or an 11% decline from the year-end 2022 level. As we have done since the onset of the current tightening cycle, we facilitated these client allocation decisions using cash flows from our investment portfolios as well as the continued utilization of certain supplemental funding sources, including Federal Home Loan Bank advances and retail certificates of deposit. We began to reduce our reliance on these additional sources – repaying 18% of peak balances reached in May 2023 – as realignment activity decelerated by almost 80% during the second half of the year, including a seasonal increase in client cash in December. Earlier in the year, we made the decision to temporarily suspend our stock buyback program after repurchasing 37 million shares for $2.8 billion during the first quarter of the year. This action allows us to more rapidly build our capital ratios inclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income via our healthy earnings power and lower capital intensity. The company’s preliminary consolidated Tier 1 Leverage and Adjusted Tier 1 Leverage (1) ratios increased to 8.5% and 4.9%, respectively. Ratios for Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB) grew as well, with CSB’s preliminary Tier 1 Leverage finishing the year at 10.1%, or 5.4% on an adjusted basis (1).""', 'Mr. Crawford concluded, ""While 2023 presented a number of challenges, we stayed focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients. Guided by our client-centric approach, we move ahead with confidence that our ""through the cycle"" financial formula keeps us positioned to deliver long-term stockholder value.""', '(1)', '\xa0', 'Further details on non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results are included on pages 10-12 of this release.', 'Commentary from the CFO', 'Periodically, our Chief Financial Officer provides insight and commentary regarding Schwab’s financial picture at: https://www.aboutschwab.com/cfo-commentary.

It has amassed assets over $36.78 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.', 'Why Large Cap Blend', 'Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.', 'Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.', 'Costs', ""Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same."", 'Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.', 'It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.39%.', 'Sector Exposure and Top Holdings', ""While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis."", 'This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 28.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.', 'Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 6.83% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).', 'The top 10 holdings account for about 29.37% of total assets under management.', 'Performance and Risk', 'SCHX seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market measures all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. The index includes approximately the largest 750 stocks and is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted.', 'The ETF has lost about -0.18% so far this year and is up about 21.15% in the last one year (as of 01/17/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $45.54 and $56.60.', 'The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 17.85% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 756 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.', 'Alternatives', 'Schwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHX is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.', 'The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $402.13 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $482.03 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.', 'Bottom-Line', 'Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.', 'To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It’s a pre-election symphony of power plays and calculated gambits where market dynamics intertwine with electoral outcomes.', 'The article explores the tapestry of three titans, each carving its path amidst ideological tides, offering astute investors a compass to navigate the pre-election market volatility.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com', 'To begin with, the F-35 program is a cornerstone of Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) growth strategy. This is evident in the delivery of\xa030 aircraft\xa0in Q3 and a year-to-date total of 80 jets (Q3 2023). Also, boosting global interest in the F-35 from countries like Denmark, the Czech Republic, South Korea and Australia signifies revenue diversification. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin’s successful securing of contracts with international partners indicates its prolonged global edge.', 'At the topline, Lockheed Martin delivered a\xa02%\xa0year-over-year increase in sales, reaching $16.9 billion. This growth indicates consistent market demand and their ability to maintain revenue streams. Additionally, the company’s backlog remains historically high at $156 million.

Moreover, its free cash flow stood at a robust $2.5 billion, representing strong liquidity.

Trump-labeled policies supporting domestic manufacturing could favor Nucor’s steel production, especially if there are measures to boost industrial output.', 'Finally, with a Democratic outcome, the efforts toward infrastructure and green initiatives might also benefit Nucor.

These companies are considered to be stable, reliable, and financially strong, as they have demonstrated the ability to generate consistent earnings growth and return value to shareholders through regular dividend payments. In 2023, dividend stocks became less popular despite the overall success of the three major US stock indexes, which managed to achieve double-digit returns even during regional banking challenges, high-interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Rising interest rates led investors to prefer bonds with attractive yields over riskier stocks that offered smaller dividends. The hype around artificial intelligence also drew investors towards large-cap tech stocks, causing the rest of the market to lag.', ""The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with a history of increasing dividends for the past 25 years, only saw a 5.7% increase in 2023, in contrast to the S&P 500 total return index's substantial 26% gain. This marked a shift from 2022 when the dividend index outperformed the total return index as investors sought income-generating stocks amid concerns about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes."", ""That said, dividend growth stocks have consistently demonstrated strong performance over the years. A report from ProShares highlighted the period from May 2005 to September 2023, during which the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index outperformed the broader market. Over this timeframe, the Dividend Aristocrats index delivered a total return of 10.35%, surpassing the 9.54% return of the broader market. Furthermore, when examining volatility, the Dividend Aristocrats index displayed a 15.35% volatility rate during this time frame. In comparison, the S&P 500 had slightly higher volatility at 16.31%. These figures suggest that, while both indices delivered competitive returns, the Dividend Aristocrats index managed to achieve this with slightly lower volatility, emphasizing the relative stability and resilience of dividend growth stocks in the investment landscape. The report also mentioned that from its beginning, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has secured 90% of the market's gains while enduring only 81% of its losses. This track record has significantly contributed to the sustained outperformance of the strategy over the long term."", ""While dividend growth stocks have demonstrated consistent performance over time, it's worth noting that several dividend aristocrats have lost their status for various reasons. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, from late 2008 to 2019, a total of 33 companies were removed from the Aristocrats list. This indicates that despite the overall stability of dividend growth stocks, individual companies within the category may experience changes in their dividend status due to different circumstances. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Management’s quick action undertaking an aggressive $240M cost reduction program have begun to offset inflationary pressures and stabilize their transformation plan. This point in time for Gannett appears remarkably similar to The New York Times transformation 10 years ago. NY Times’ share price rose 10-fold since then as the company successfully eliminated $1B corporate debt and scaled their digital subscribers to stabilize cash flow generation and return to growth. We believe Gannett potentially has a greater monetization opportunity due to their larger 180M monthly visits to their digital platforms. By further expanding their digital offerings and developing new high[1]margin content partnerships, Gannett appears positioned to return to growth over the next 12-18 months. In addition, Gannett recently announced an anti-trust lawsuit against Google which follows similar actions by the European Central Bank (ECB) and various states. Winning the case has the potential to accelerate the transformation, as anti-trust cases have treble damages which can award up to three times compensatory damages, potentially leading to a future award well in excess of $1B, versus a current market capitalization of approximately $370M.”', 'Date Removed from S&P Dividend Aristocrats: 2009', 'Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) is next on our list of dividend aristocrats that slashed their dividends.

While quarterly earnings are expected to have declined, revenues might have witnessed a rise on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, RJF’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were adversely impacted by a rise in expenses, disappointing investment banking (IB) performance and higher bank loss provision for credit losses. Yet, higher net interest income, a decent loan demand and past acquisitions acted as tailwinds.Raymond James doesn’t have a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the trailing four quarters.', 'Raymond James Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Raymond James Financial, Inc. Quote', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.25, which has moved almost 1% lower over the past seven days. The figure indicates a fall of 1.8% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at $2.19, implying a 4.3% decline.The consensus estimate for sales of $2.98 billion suggests 7% year-over-year growth. We expect net revenues to be $2.97 billion.', 'IB Fees: While green shoots were visible in the IB space, overall M&A activities remained subdued on a year-over-year basis. Headwinds like lingering geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, higher interest rates and China’s economic slowdown weighed on deal-making. Thus, the deal volume and total value numbers were weak in the quarter, which might have hurt Raymond James’ advisory fees.Because of the above-mentioned macro concerns, the IPO markets did not witness much activity in the quarter. While follow-up equity issuances were decent on the back of robust equity market performance toward the end of the year, bond issuance volumes were decent. So, RJF’s underwriting fees are expected to have been positively impacted in the quarter.The consensus estimate for IB fees is pegged at $166.2 million, suggesting a 17.9% rise on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate IB fees of $126 million.Trading Revenues: Unlike the past few quarters, when huge market volatility and client activity drove trading revenues, capital markets were subdued in the to-be-reported quarter. While the risk of a near-term recession has faded, concerns like the economic slowdown, persistent inflation and other geopolitical issues led to ambiguity among investors in the quarter. These factors resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. So, Raymond James’ trading revenues are likely to have been subdued.Net Interest Income: Lending activities remained weak in the to-be-reported quarter. Continuing with its efforts to curb inflation, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rates unchanged at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. While this is likely to have had a favorable impact on RJF’s net interest income (NII), the inversion of the yield curve in the December-ended quarter and higher deposit costs are expected to have weighed on it to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interest income stands at $1.02 billion, indicating a jump of 23.5%. Our estimate for the metric is the same as the consensus number.Expenses: Raymond James consistently hires advisors and invests in franchises. Thus, overall expenses are expected to have risen in the quarter. Also, due to a highly competitive environment, costs might have been elevated.We project total non-interest expenses to be $2.38 billion, implying an 11.4% year-over-year increase.', 'The company expects combined NII and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to decline 5% sequentially.The Private Client Group segment results are expected to be favorably impacted by the 2% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts.', 'According to our proven model, the chances of Raymond James beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high.

Pick', ""Good morning and thank you for joining us. It is a privilege to be with you. Today, I will deliver the annual deck that was a hallmark of James Gorman's 14-year tenure, both to a firm Morgan Stanley strategy and to provide a level of transparency on our progress that you have come to respect. Let's turn to the slides, turning first to Slide 3. Over the last 15 years, we have transformed the firm's business mix, scale, profitability and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution. Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to '14, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story. Transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The investment bank was reset and the firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis. In 2015 to '19, we weathered the years of financial recession, resizing our fixed income business and pressing ahead to the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium which was a step towards leadership in the corporate stock plan space. And in 2020 to '22, the COVID years, we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the 2 major business lines, Wealth and Investment Management and Institutional Securities generated operating leverage and high returns. Transformed Morgan Stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth. Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry challenges, the firm's business model generated consistent results. In 2023, firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT, double the averages of 2009 to '14. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points. Last year's return profile was triple the post-crisis years. Combined earnings from Wealth and Investment Management generated 60% of the firm's top line and PBT and our Category 1 asset gathering strategy sets the stage for continued durable growth. The Institutional Securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking, equities and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world. Taken together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has lot higher and more stable profitability. The actions we've taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center is acting as a trusted adviser to clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. It is what we do. We are a global leader and we are really good at it. This will not change. Turning to Slide 4. Since 2010, revenues in Wealth and Investment Management have more than doubled and today, we're #1 in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunities to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion in total client assets. In Wealth Management, we have established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across 3 channels: advisor-led, self-directed and workplace. The business generated $1 trillion of net new assets over the past 3 years and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect M&A growth to continue to vary quarter-by-quarter given seasonality and even year-to-year given market tone and the cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets all the way. We are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our wealth management offering. Over time, our ability to attract, deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins. Given some of the recent macro headwinds and our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-20s range over the near term. The underlying business has achieved 30% margins before and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue. Our wealth platform is complemented by investment management, where we've added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth, including customization such as Parametric, private markets and value-add credit. At a holistic level, the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale, which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through the cycles. Turning to Slide 5. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our integrated investment bank is a preeminent global franchise. Our capability set, extensive client footprint and premier brand puts us in a position to be the trusted adviser to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager and asset owner. Our teams across geographies, businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation [formation]. Over the last decade, we've advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13 trillion of capital for clients. And as indication of our market presence, in a single trading session last month, our equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the U.S. acting as a true global investment bank is critical for the Morgan Stanley franchise. After more than 5 years managing our integrated investment bank, I'd add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer competitors and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity, which will drive investment banking growth and as such, are particularly focused on expanding our 15% wallet share in that advice-driven business. Turning to Slide 6. When you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm. Our capacity to source new client opportunities, efficiently facilitate the flow of capital and deliver Morgan Stanley firm-wide solutions has never been stronger. Looking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs, from advising the C-suite on strategy, helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising the broader employee base through our workplace offering. Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed, up through to the ultra-high net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class institutional capabilities paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model. Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of financial innovation and growth. Our global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are augmented by scaled distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through to the individual retail client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm. Turning to Slide 7. Ultimately, the firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as our Co-Presidents, our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation gives us a lens into where we come from and where we are going. Intentional mobility of our leadership engineered by James over these many years is particularly important. Andy in his expanded role as Head of both Wealth and Investment Management is well situated to leverage his deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business. Dan, having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly 1 decade is returning to lead institutional securities where he spent 25 years, will play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities, structuring, financing and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan and Andy as partners to open 2024, speaks to the enduring strength of our culture. Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis, through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than 20 years. Long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way. In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our long-standing leaders, we are enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by world-class technology and infrastructure organization and by 2,320 talented Managing Directors, 155 of whom we promoted to the partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today. Turning to Slide 8. In addition to, one, the performance of the business; two, driving integrated firm; and three, maintaining our culture, we are -- four, highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our deliberate growth in durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong, owing to the finalization of Basel III Endgame. Our regulatory requirements as measured within our stress capital buffer have steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses. With respect to Basel III Endgame, we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further evaluation of economic and competitive impacts that the final rule will result in a well more constructive outcome than originally proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend as it is at the core of our business model's durability. While we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses and repurchase our stock, the core strength and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown from $0.05 to $0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount. With the firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide 9 reiterates our confidence in them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The 4 firm-wide goals are in place, hitting $10 trillion in client assets, achieving a 30% wealth management pretax margin, a 70% firm-wide efficiency ratio and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity. Our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals. We enter 2024 with confidence and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are 2 major downside risks. The first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing, that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels. On the other hand, if inflation, in fact, has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and the supply chain, that could result in a stickier Fed and the resulting higher for longer will have to be absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy. These risks, the geopolitical and that of the U.S. economy presents some uncertainties as we start 2024. Nevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle. And based on the evidence we see, are building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year ahead. We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business. A world-class wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investment management and remain committed to growing high-quality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world. In so doing, we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results. And then together, we'll take your questions. Thank you."", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $54.1 billion in 2023 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $12.9 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 12.8% and EPS was $5.18. And for the fourth quarter, ROTCE was 8.4% and EPS was $0.85. The full year efficiency ratio was 77.2%. A number of factors impacted our annual and quarterly results. The full year results include nearly $900 million of notable items. Over half of these items were reflected in the fourth quarter, a $286 million FDIC special assessment charge and a legal settlement of $249 million, were both realized in the fourth quarter. In addition, the full year results include $353 million of severance expenses, primarily related to the May employee action. The combination of these 3 items negatively impacted full year EPS by $0.44, ROTCE by 105 basis points and the efficiency ratio by 164 basis points. Total integration-related expenses for the year were $293 million, nearly 70% of which was related to E*TRADE. With the E*TRADE integration now complete, we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base, supporting our long-term efficiency goals, while still investing in growth. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues were $23.1 billion and quarterly revenues were $4.9 billion. Full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the onset of the hiking cycle and geopolitical events in early 2022 and persisted through most of the past year. Fourth quarter revenues reflected stronger investment banking results and prudent risk management across fixed income and equities. Investment Banking revenues were $4.6 billion for the full year. Lower completed M&A transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of 2022 and early 2023, which weighed on results. However, optimism began to rise midyear, followed by a notable increase in Morgan Stanley's announced volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting as the investment-grade market remained open for regular-way issuance and was supported by event-driven activity. Advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters and were roughly flat year-over-year. Equity underwriting revenues were also flat as activity remains muted. As we enter 2024, we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set. While downside risks are linked to the consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as 2 key determinants, we expect the U.S. will lead the recovery globally. Corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward and we are encouraged by signs that the CEO and boardroom optimism is growing, evidenced by the build of our advisory and IPO pipeline. Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop, particularly where the institution works across the businesses, with CEOs, CFOs and treasurers on Corporate Solutions. Strength ed sentiment should support broad M&A and new capital market issuance and eventually feed through to the broader market activity. Equity full year revenues were $10 billion, reflecting lower revenues across regions. Tempered client engagement was reflective of broad market uncertainty. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Prime brokerage revenues in the fourth quarter were solid. Results reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client balances. Cash results declined versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting lower volumes, particularly in Asia, ex Japan. Derivative results were up versus last year's fourth quarter as the business continued to grow the client base. Fixed income revenues were $7.7 billion for the full year, declining from 2022's strong results. The full year decline was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities which were impacted by greater uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter. Results reflected fewer monetization opportunities, particularly in Asia, compared to heightened engagement in the region last year. Micro is down year-over-year, driven by lower revenues in credit corporates which was negatively impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events. Results in commodities were up versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improved performance in the Power and Gas business. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management's revenues were $26.3 billion and the pretax profit was $6.5 billion, which resulted in a PBT margin of 24.9%. Reported results reflect the complex macro backdrop as well as several idiosyncratic events. The unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates were particularly consequential as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin. In addition, there were several expense items that impacted the margin, including integration-related expenses, the FDIC special assessment, severance charges and the impact of DCP, which saw meaningful swings compared to last year. Taken together, these 4 items impacted the full year margin by over 250 basis points. Total client assets ended the year at a new high, reaching $5.1 trillion of assets. Full year fee-based flows were $109 billion. These flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client portfolios, supporting the year-over-year increase in asset management revenues. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion and the reported PBT margin was 21.5%. The aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin by over 400 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up approximately $200 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. Quarterly fee-based flows were strong at $42 billion, underscoring the value clients are seeing in our advice-based model. Client allocations to higher yielding cash alternatives remained elevated and clients continue to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances. The eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind as clients look to redeploy into broader asset classes. Net new assets of $282 billion for the year represented 7% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $47 billion. For the full year, net new asset growth was driven by the advisor-led channel, across existing clients, new clients and net recruiting. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion, excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues increased slightly year-over-year as clients invested in structured products and fixed income products. Bank lending balances of $147 billion remained roughly flat, consistent with the environment. Total deposits increased 2% quarter-over-quarter to $346 billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our wealth management channel and a modest increase in sweep balances. Net interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of average deposits and the blended deposit costs in the quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income. The modest sequential build in sweeps was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps in client accounts. Assuming that the forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter. Our asset-led gathering strategy remains unchanged and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time. The path is clear and includes the following objectives: first, increase relationships through our channel; second, migrate assets to advice; third, deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities, including new products and solutions. And finally realize scale benefits of our investments over time. These efforts are well underway. In the year, we grew client relationships by over 600,000 across the franchise. This was led by success in the workplace channel as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plans. In the prior 3 years, we saw an average of $50 billion of workplace assets migrate to the advisor-led channel on an annual basis. This year, client migration was up 25% year-over-year despite economic headwinds. And on the products side, our financial advisers are offering clients investment opportunities such as private credit, private equity and other alternatives. Bringing wealth and investment management closer together will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation. As we move forward and transition from integration to optimization for client experience, we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time. Investment Management reported full year results of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion. AUM increased year-over-year to $1.5 trillion supported by higher asset values. Long-term net inflows of approximately $7 billion -- excuse me, long-term net outflows of approximately $7 billion was driven by headwinds in our MSIM active equity growth strategy. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for Parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies, as more retail clients seek customized solutions. Liquidity overlay services had outflows of $6.6 billion. Weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for Parametric's overlay products. And the combined Parametric brand, inclusive of overlay and its retail offering, had net inflows of over $5 billion, again this quarter, underscoring the strength of our differentiated customized offerings. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.4 billion increased slightly versus last year. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $61 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and infrastructure offset losses in real estate, reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased by $13 billion sequentially to $457 billion, as we actively supported clients. We prudently managed our capital profile and ended the year with a standardized CET1 ratio of 15.2%, while focusing on our strategic priorities, including our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic at the start of the fourth quarter and we bought back $1.3 billion of common stock. The full year tax rate was 21.9%, reflecting the realization of certain tax benefits earlier in the year. The fourth quarter's tax rate was 26.5%, primarily reflecting the tax implications of a specific legal matter. We expect the 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, consistent with prior years, we continue to expect some quarterly volatility. A number of idiosyncratic and macro headwinds added complexity to the backdrop over the last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we ended the year better than where we started. We now have $6.6 trillion of client assets and we successfully completed our E*TRADE integration as it relates to capital markets, boardroom confidence is rising and our calendar is building. We approach 2024 with optimism, keenly aware of the dynamic environment we operate in, as we continue to drive towards our performance goals. With that, we will now open the line up to questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. It looks like we lost Dan, we'll move to Glenn Schorr with Evercore."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""So Sharon, I love how you laid out the picture on the wealth management margin potential. And I do like that sweeps have settled in. So I'm curious, in the big picture, has FA and client behavior changed a bunch on the cash management front such that, that's a potential driver of margin potential and why you're leaning towards that mid-20s near term versus the 30% where we were kind of hanging out when rates were lower and deposits were higher. Is that the primary driver of the margin thought? And do you think behaviors changed, like permanently?"", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""So can't speak to behaviors permanently. But I appreciate the question, Glenn. If we take a step back, it was always a idea, the premise of a sustainable growth in margin was really about ensuring that we continue to see growth in fee-based assets and we see growth in that migration towards the advice-based channel. And in fact, that is what you've begun to see. Look at our fee-based flows this quarter alone and think about the fee-based flows that we've had over the course of the year. We continue to educate our clients. So when we think through the funnel, we have more participants, we begin to see more assets and then those assets will, over time, migrate to advice. What you point out, as we think about the cash and what some might call cash sorting, et cetera, is that we still have that 22%, 23% sitting in cash equivalents, so not necessarily BDP but rather cash equivalents that don't necessarily earn a fee, right? Money markets, think of a savings product over time, et cetera, that you might see. As individuals begin to take that money and deploy it in the markets or deploy it into fee-based, that will be accretive to the margin over time. And that, to your point, is a place where you should begin to see a margin build and something that becomes more sustainable as we both grow our asset base and grow the advice and the client migration towards advice in those fee-based assets."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""Makes sense. I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up in wealth, if I could. It certainly doesn't show in your flows this quarter. So I guess I know where you're going to go with this but you're definitely hearing a lot more from the bank-owned wealth management companies that are turning up the heat a little bit on recruiting and a lot more on their intent to better penetrate their banking wallet -- clients wallet. So I'm curious if you feel any of that in your franchise, any of that where you compete and whether or not that impacts your thought process on your ability to attract some of the trillions of dollars held away that is always part of the growth story."", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""So the first point I would say is it's obviously always a competitive market but we're very well positioned given the tools that we've given to our advisers. A couple of points that I would make to you. The first is, when we look forward into the first quarter, that recruiting pipeline is healthy. So when we think about January and what we're seeing, we see the recruiting being healthy. The second point that I'd mention is, what I find to be most encouraging, when you look under the M&A data, is that we're seeing new clients come to Morgan Stanley. So it's not just attracting assets all the way but rather you're actually getting new clients from those participants. And then you're seeing conversion. So when you think about some of the statistics that I gave you around workplace and we've talked about these statistics, the workplace assets that move over, you have 80% of those assets are actually assets that are coming from outside the institution. So you're bringing new clients in and then they're bringing their assets that are sitting away into the institution. So I think we're well positioned to capture those opportunities. Final point that I'd make is on your banking products, actually, this idea of the E*TRADE integration, right and we talked about, we've completed the integration, and I said we're looking towards the forward of the front office integration, some of that will be around banking products, et cetera, as we think and we look ahead over a multiyear journey."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies."", 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', ""Congrats on the new role, Ted. I was hoping you could elaborate on the current environment and a little bit more and maybe what you see as the biggest opportunities for growth as you look to make progress against the longer-term targets that you've outlined?"", 'Edward N. Pick', ""I think we -- as you heard from my comments, we're generally constructive about what 2024 brings and it should be beneficial to both arms of the firm. Some of the reorientation of cash equivalents, whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like that Sharon referred to and redeployed by our wealth clients into the markets, given increasing sense of stability, clearly good for FAs and for the wealth channel. In the investment bank, we've had a decade's long [rout] in IPOs, the slowest volume we've seen in decades. As you know, we've had very light M&A calendar. So that also has been at a trough, sort of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the investment bank, specifically inside of investment banking, we think, in order to our benefit too.So we quite possibly could have a dynamic where if we are in this soft landing zone, we could see increased activity. Ultimately, we are in the tickets business activity based in both channels and benign economic conditions augur well for both wealth and investment but also for the investment bank. And part of the reason I wanted to talk about the integrated firm today was because the 2 segments are working together, will bring inevitably additional growth opportunities in the firm. We have folks that have mobilized around the enterprise, are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in additional business. We have a big business, as you know, in Europe and in Asia. So if economic conditions are better than the expected, which is that Europe will struggle and China might as well. If we do any better than that, we would expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions too. So it's not just a U.S. proposition but a global one as well."", 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', 'Great. And you mentioned margins within the wealth channel or wealth segment will consolidate around the mid-20s here in the near term. Can you maybe unpack some of the inputs that will drive that outcome?', 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""Certainly. I worked through that, I think, Dan, when I actually tried to explain it in the script. So the premise in terms of the growing wealth management margin, again, is about the conversion to the advice-based model over time. Of course, individuals will have different pieces, right? But we have 3 different channels that we've talked about. We talked about self-directed. We talked about workplace. We talked about advice. The self-directed side, we will continue to attract those clients and those that might be interested in advice, we'll see it as we have different ways to give people a sense and a connection to FA. So we've talked about that. On the workplace side, we continue to get new participants, new corporate relationships and that as we educate people with the wellness offering, et cetera -- and we've seen evidence of this, to bring people yet again to that advice-driven model. And the fee-based flows, as you see those, those will help us grow the asset management line. Then you can break it down again, the transactional lines we've talked about. You're going to have new products and you're going to have a deployment of this cash that's been sitting on the sidelines that we've talked a lot about, the dry powder that could impact either the transactional line or the asset management line. And again, we're encouraged by the signs that we're seeing in NII. That too suggests that we are seeing, as of right now, it looks like that cash, that frictional level of cash is stabilizing. So thinking of the drivers in each of those lines as we think about the revenue side. And then as you think about the expense side, we are looking for places to invest and gain from the scale of those investments and that will be as part of the objectives that Ted laid out when you see $10 trillion of assets."", 'Operator', ""We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', 'Welcome, Ted. Maybe just going back to the strategic update, going to Slide 13, where you sort of lay out very nicely the transformation over the last 15 years. As we look forward over the next 3 to 5 years, I was wondering if you can help fill in the blanks around, strategically, I mean M&A has been a key pillar of this transformation. As we think about both organic and inorganic; one, on the M&A side, give us a sense of just where you see deal making happening over the next few years. We saw a big private asset deal being announced on Friday. And so would love some perspective there. And then I think the second thing you mentioned in terms of wallet share on the investment banking side, if we can unpack that a little bit in terms of how you expect to achieve a greater wallet share.', 'Edward N. Pick', ""Good to talk to you -- with you. It's an interesting question. You're effectively asking what will the slide look like 3, 4 years from now. We believe that the revenue mix will toggle around. There could be periods like in 2020 or '21, where the investment bank is really firing on all cylinders. Again, early economy type of activity and that could grow again towards 50%. And we are going to have other periods where, as we continue to invest in the wealth and investment management piece of the firm, that could expand further. I think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where 60% of the firm is in wealth and investment management is not a bad place to start. I think the main message I'd want to convey today is that while there is a change in leadership after 14 years of James' stewardship, there's not a change in strategy. We have undertaken and integrated -- if you really go back into time and then include Mesa West, 5 different acquisitions. And I think the view inside the house is that's, that's good for now. We can execute our business with the growth plans in front of us and it feels organic. Now that having been said, there are ideas that come across the transom and we naturally would take a look. But I think for the next period, the view that I would have is that we really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently. I think on the margin, one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more. There's a little more work to be done post integration where there could be inefficiencies along the income statement. And I think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the strategic investment that we want to make on our way to 30% PBT margins in wealth and 70% efficiency of the firm. The way I've articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate we will achieve those goals. But along the way, we will invest and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way. And that is why, for me, the most important message we wanted to send out to folks today with this concept of the integrated firm. Now we have the portfolio of businesses together. We have a unified partnership culture. We have the 2 halves of the firm, it'll toggle by 5 or 10 points on revenue or profitability given a period of time and now we can scale that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit."", 'Operator', ""We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""I wanted to start off, I think, Sharon, with just a question on incremental margins and comp leverage in a lower rate backdrop. We know NII is going to be a source of drag in the coming quarter, certainly if the forward curve manifests but fee should see improved momentum from equity market tailwinds, stronger fee base flows, a better IB backdrop. But the Street is modeling comp dollars flat, revenues up about $2 billion. I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental margins as revenue momentum improves but the growth is coming in mainly from more compensable areas."", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""So you obviously did hit the nail on the head in terms of the different pieces, right? So you can't look at the different line items the same way. You're going to have a comp ratio change as FAs get compensated, as you would expect, on the grid, associated with those fee-based revenues. As it relates to NII, yes, that was noncompensable, as I just told you the expectation. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, if client behavior remains unchanged, you are sitting in a position where you're beginning to better understand what that behavior is and that NII will be roughly in line with where it was in the fourth quarter, at least for the first quarter. So yes, the comp itself might change but the actual growth in the ability to see the fee-based assets grow is higher. There are also other offsetting factors that we have to think about as we look back into the last year. Remember that what I highlighted was, you had negative implications associated with mix of revenue in those asset management lines because of the fact that we saw investors invest in the fixed income products. You add market dynamics associated with billing, et cetera. So there is place -- there are rather places that you can see growth in the asset management line. Yes, they will be compensable but we would see benefits of scale, both from the asset side and hopefully, from the market side as you see different pieces being invested as you move forward. I hope that helps to frame the answer to your question."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""You know, that's really helpful. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping you could just speak to the sensitivity to lower rates. It's a big area of focus for investors. You benefit from having the majority of your deposits in premium savings, where admittedly you have bigger pricing flexibility. At the same time, the asset side is still very sensitive to the short end. So I wanted to get a sense as to how you expect the NII trajectory to unfold as the Fed begins easing and whether there's any appetite on your side to extend duration to maybe lock in some higher yields."", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""That's a great question. And the answer is fully premised on what we see first with deposits, right? So your sort of first order condition, as you look ahead into 2024 is, what happens to the deposit mix? What I said on the call is that we're encouraged -- in my prepared remarks, we're encouraged by what we've seen to date, as the beginning of January. If you were to assume that, that were to hold, the next question is, what is the pace of the interest rate cuts that we see? If you see an instantaneous shock, we disclose to you what that means, right? So an instantaneous 100-basis point shock lower will be negative, around $600 million, right? However, if it was more gradual in nature, which is similar to what you might see in the forward curve, you will have offsets associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio. So that will offset the rate decline, right, will largely offset those rate declines. But it will depend, first order condition, is our deposits stable, is the mix stable and that's what we've seen so far. So let's see if that holds. And then second, what is the pace of the cuts over the course of the year."", 'Operator', ""We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities."", 'Devin Patrick Ryan', ""Sharon, maybe just start with a question on investment banking and good to hear about the tone improvement there. Sponsors have been less active than corporates, at least from the data we track. And we know sponsors have record dry powder but higher interest rates, current valuations have been a little bit challenging for them. So just the question is whether they are in a position to return in force over the next year. I think that's probably going to be necessary for full normalization in investment banking. And then just what you're seeing when you talk about the pipelines that you have, which are good, what are sponsors doing in those pipelines?"", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""Sure. Overall, the pipeline is more diversified than we've necessarily seen in historical years. We expect to see continued momentum in energy that we've seen over the past year. We see optimistic signs in real estate and we see optimistic signs in technology. As it relates to sponsors, we would expect sponsors to come back. That will obviously take time and I do think it will likely take a couple of potential (inaudible) in certain places and other things that will be encouraging will be on the equity IPO side. What I'd say is, we've moved from a period of time that was window driven and that market is beginning to build momentum. And so the juxtaposition between the outlook for '24, I think in '23, is important there as well."", 'Devin Patrick Ryan', ""Okay. Terrific. And then a question for Ted. So I think you're pretty clear here, the strategic trajectory is not changing dramatically. But we often get the question around stylistically what's changing. And so you have a different background than James. I think everyone has their own management style and you've run some big businesses, very successfully for Morgan Stanley. So want to maybe just hit on briefly how you would characterize kind of your style and just the ability to leverage your experience and what may change as a result of that?"", 'Edward N. Pick', ""James and I are more -- much more similar than not. He brings to the table a positive mojo to the business from the time that he took over as CEO when things were in, as you know, pretty rough shape. And for now in his 15th year of leadership as Exec Chair, he brings a positive spirit to every single interaction that we have, whether it's our operating and management committees, our risk meetings, these calls, client interactions, cultural work with our -- with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization. I think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization. It's something that I'm a big believer in and has worked well inside of the trading businesses, inside of investment banking and I think you can feel it throughout the firm. So the reaffirmation of our partnership, our core values and this articulation of the integrated firm, which is the next step now because we went from trying to build our way back, to generating the kind of enhanced scale and deeper moat through these gutsy acquisitions. That brought us to a place now where we can look around and see how we can bring the firm closer together. I think the tone is one of determination. I've been at this place for more than 3 decades and we had our moment sort of before the abyss in a way and I think it's fair to say that the entire senior partnership, James but also the folks that came through the organization, like myself, we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like those days. So the calling card here is durability, is consistency. We want to put up consistent results. Part of what you see in the strategic deck in the back page, those are very clear numbers and we will hit them. We will hit those numbers. It will take time. We will have to do all of the 3 yards and a cloud of dust work associated with and thoughtfully working our way to those numbers such that when we hit them in a normalized environment, which will be part of the next arrow on Page 3 in the years to come, we will have done so in a way where we can achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time but sustainable. And that obviously is also the calling card of James' tenure, which is that of consistency and durability. So if the first is his positive mojo and the second is his ethos of consistency, rigor, durability, I think the third, at the end of the day, has been to believe in what Morgan Stanley can aspire to for clients. And that is this integrated firm that we are something differentiated in our 2 channels, very clear on what we do and what we don't do and that the cycle is very much a tailwind for us."", 'Operator', ""We'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research."", 'Chinedu Bolu', ""Maybe, Ted, for you, on the trading businesses, Morgan Stanley has suffered some share loss over the last couple of years and your peers have been aggressively allocating capital to that business and gaining share. So maybe curious on how you're thinking about opportunities to grow those businesses and any plans to either invest more capital or resources into that business?"", 'Edward N. Pick', ""Christian, good to hear your voice. I think we know that we have -- we have achieved the top 3 position in the Institutional Securities business over the last number of years. But as you say on the margin, we have lost share to the #1 and #2. And I think our view has been that, that is a trade that we've been willing to make both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability mix that you see today. But also importantly, the preservation of capital, which allows us today irrespective of where we are in Basel III Endgame to have a CET1 ratio that is well above 15%. As you've heard, I am with the team, much focused on the durability of the dividend. And so there's been a real focus on what shareholders want and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable Morgan Stanley. Now that having been said, what you saw in 2020 was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing to the client base if the tailwinds are there. Part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that, if, for example, balances start working in the prime brokerage context or if there are '21, '22 highs, where we're about 10% away from those figures, well, then perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities, namely the front brokerage business on behalf of clients. There may be other periods where the event space, which was an illusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors, that, that activity may come back because, of course, at some point, these large assets need to trade in the sponsor community, is dependent at some level on the Street to engage in velocity. So there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the investment bank. I think what we would say in 2024 is that it's not really a choice between wealth and investment management or the Institutional Securities business. We will engage in both activities but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share. The name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrates operating leverage in each of the 2 businesses and ultimately, to get to holistic returns. So we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put to use is and where we can serve clients over a long period of time. We're paying attention to it very, very carefully. And what I'm most excited about, Christian, is that the cycle that's coming, the investment banking-led cycle is coming at a time when we spent years putting together and I know you've met some of these folks, or so-called integrated investment bank. What is differentiated about this place is that we have bankers, equities people and fixed income folks who work together. They work together on client solutions. What I'm proposing on our behalf is now we extend that proposition to the firm. We're at -- in the wealth business, the investment management business and inside the investment bank. We can work together around clients ultimately to generate operating leverage and returns. And that is for me, the most exciting part of the next chapter, which is, we got the team, we've got the excess capital. But again, I like the excess capital because it's part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on Basel III Endgame. I would add if, in fact, the Basel III Endgame outcome is more favorable than perhaps that the Street expects. We will adjust accordingly but we have tools. And part of that's dividend, part of that's investing in the business. Part of that, obviously, is buying stock back. But ultimately, having a real capital cushion is something that shareholders have come to expect from James and that's something they should continue to expect from me."", 'Chinedu Bolu', ""Awesome. Very clear, Ted. And then maybe another one on Wealth Management margins, unfortunately, maybe for Sharon. I kind of hear you, Sharon, very clearly that you think higher revenues will drive margins over time. I guess -- but if I just about look at the business, 2019 versus today, wealth management revenues are up 50%. This is where they were in 2019, where your margins have compressed. And again, I know there's onetime items in the quarter, or in the year but it doesn't seem to me like bigger revenues have driven operating leverage. So what gives you confidence that going forward, revenue growth will drive meaningful operating leverage?"", 'Sharon Yeshaya', ""Really around the conversion. That's why I keep talking about the conversion, Christian. We brought the statistics up last year. We've brought the statistics up again this year in terms of seeing conversion from workplace, about seeing net new assets coming in and then seeing those assets migrate. New clients giving FAs time. All of those things are able to give us more durable asset management-based revenue as we move forward. So to your question and I think Steve asked a similar question, the NII will fluctuate, obviously, based on rates and on consumer and customer behavior. And so the goal, while that has been something that we say, don't forget the bank. Don't forget the margin that you'll get from that. Over time, the goal is to have a more sustainable $1 trillion of assets coming through both wealth and investment management, those assets will earn fees to some portion of it and we see the migration into fee-based, right? We have 50% of advisor-led assets sitting in fee-based accounts. That's the ultimate proposition from seeing an expanded margin and seeing the benefits of scale. And we have invested in workplace. We've invested in getting new channels and getting new participants. The time is now to begin to see conversion and we have evidence, factual evidence that I pointed to on this call to show you that we're making progress towards those goals."", 'Edward N. Pick', ""What I'd add, Christian, is, again, all goals being equally important, we will hit that $10 trillion number. So part of it is to allow for some of this latency, if you will, on assets held away, on assets working their way through workplace. It's a space that we are a leader in. It's a space that is relatively embryonic in the wealth business. And we will allow for some time for those assets to convert. But the key, of course, is to have them in-house and then as well to see that folks who are our new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing brokerage accounts that they bring them to the firm as well."", 'Operator', ""Due to time constraints, we'll take just 1 question and no follow-up going forward from analysts. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS."", 'Brennan Hawken', ""Congrats to Ted on the new role. I will -- since I only get 1 shot at this, I will ask on the long-term targets. So we -- there were some slight changes here. We lost some pluses and we lost less than on the efficiency ratio, although in fairness, we gained a plus on the client assets. So was that a reflection of -- these are long-term targets, so I'm guessing it's not really a reflection of the current environment. So what drove the tweak there to maybe signal some reduction in some of the upside scenarios? And how should -- you've referenced the fact that you need the environment to normalize, how should we be thinking about progression towards these targets? And what specific nonenvironmental actions you can be taking in order to move the ball there."", 'Edward N. Pick', ""Yes. Excellent question. And a lot of time given to consideration on pluses and the like. This, for me, was sort of an easy call. The page is one that we all own and getting to 30% margins is a number that we want to achieve. And at that level, having hit something that is approaching $10 trillion assets, we're going to be in a really great place. And that would be a reasonable time to say, hey, how about more. And we'd say, okay, well, clearly, we're going to continue to grow assets because the asset number, way that TAM is, is gigantic. James has mentioned, $20 trillion at one point. There are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come. Whether the pretax margin of, whether it should go about 30% at that point, before or not, I'd like to get to the 30% and I want to get there durably and thoughtfully. And the mid-20s is a range that you've seen us trade at the business to work well at and we believe we can when economic conditions normalize, as Sharon described and as new assets get put to work some combination of money markets and T-bills coming into the market again, workplace coming through the funnel. All 3 channels working on the back of increased transaction activity and new issues and the like. We should slowly and durably work our way back to 30%. The efficiency ratio, as you know, is just another way of saying 30% margins for the enterprise. Now by definition, the investment bank which has more capital and more underlying risk should have margins that exceed 30% over time. So it's fair to say that if we're hitting 30% margins in Wealth Management, we certainly should be at an enterprise efficiency ratio of 1 minus 70%, 30% as well. So 30% plus could be a way of thinking about it but I wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them. And then finally, with respect to returns on capital, this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital, what we pay out in the form of dividends, what we buy back and durably how we run the place. So we thought that 20% of ROTCE, which is something we hit during the COVID years. But of course, those were against the macroeconomic conditions, which were unusual and highly favorable that we can do 20% in a normalized environment. So this may be on the margin. And James, liked it too. When we talked about it, stylistically, my view was and the team shares it that (inaudible) the client assets, we should get there and just keep on going. But the other 3, effectively in removing the pluses, it's simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit. We will hit 30% pretax margins in wealth, 70% efficiency ratio for the firm and 20% ROTCE. It will take time. It will be -- the challenges you would expect in making that happen. And of course, we need economic conditions to line up in a favorable way. But over time, those are the firm-wide goals and we wanted to be very specific about that for you."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our last question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""Okay. Well, it looks like you have a heavy lift after following James Gorman's (inaudible) path. What is your message to the wealth managers and investment managers, that half of the company that you haven't run in the past. So you've proven yourself in half the company, that's clearly capital markets and Wall Street banking. But what's your message to the other half of the company at a time when they've had a step down in their growth rates, new asset flows on wealth and outflows in investment management."", 'Edward N. Pick', ""Mike, the Wealth business is actually in my blood. My dad and my father-in-law were both brokers once upon a time and I grew up studying that business as a kid. And I think it is absolutely that, which is differentiated on Morgan Stanley during this 15-year period. The ability to integrate Smith Barney and build out something that's truly special is -- has been existentially, as you know better than most but also thematically exactly what the firm has needed. In no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the investment bank. As you know, the history of our merger from '97 was largely about social issues but the industrial idea wasn't necessarily off at all. To build a world-class wealth manager would be something that would have enormous barriers to entry and they have run well and run in a first-class way to deliver value to clients in a differentiated manner. And what we have done, thanks to the leadership of Andy Saperstein with Jed Finn and then the investment management business with Dan Simkowitz now moving over to the Investment Bank and Ben Huneke and Jacques Chappuis running investment management today is, we've got effectively the full funnel. We've got the soup to nuts, self-directed the traditional advisory channel and this new channel workplace are working as one. I've spent time working some of the chairmen's -- and hitting a branch here in Midtown and spending some time with folks that are actually making the engine work. And I think it's fair to say that we, at one point, we were calling the wealth and investment management business, the ballast, which was the right word because we wanted to convey durability. But I'd submit to you, Mike, and hopefully, you'll appreciate the spirit of which I say this, I think it's actually the engine. I think this will be the engine for further Morgan Stanley growth. If opportunities were to come before us in the years to come, of course, we could staple them on and do something inorganically. As James alluded to, perhaps that would be outside the U.S. where I've spent a whole bunch of time but in running the actual organic business as it currently stands, we are truly a group of one. And as you know, having spent time inside the knitting of MS, what we're most excited about, Mike, you as a student of corporate culture and these investment banks, I think what you'd be most excited about is just how well we all get along. There is a 0 friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure, across wealth and investment management and across the investment bank. So the beauty of where we are today, is that all of us as shareholders and custodians of the Morgan Stanley idea and the Morgan Stanley culture of a first-class business in a first-class way are very much focused on growing both pieces of the firm and as leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow, as I said, to the $10 trillion of assets.

Many on Wall Street often turn to banks as a sign of things to come for the year. What can investors learn from these reports?', 'Chris McGratty, KBW Head of U.S. Bank Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the recent mixed earnings reports from banks and his outlook for the year.', 'When asked about pricing of bank stocks in current market, McGratty claims: ""They\'re cheap. Banks are always cheap. In my 20-year career they\'ve always been cheap because of the value aspect of the business, the regulation. What\'s interesting is the speed at which the market re-rated this group. We went from 8 to 9 times earnings to 11 to 12 pretty instantaneously, when the Fed [did] the pivot in December. What we think is fair value for the group right now is around 10, 11 times and there\'s work we\'ve done with where level of interest rates are in the multiple. We had a big run into the year.

Different story though from Morgan Stanley. Fixed income and equities trading revenue fell short of forecasts, and the bank warned of lower margins in its wealth business to come. And that comes as the other big banks reported last week, projecting quite a mixed picture for the financial sector and an uncertain outlook for the regional banks.', ""So, to get some clarity here, we've got Chris Mcgratty, head of US Bank Research at KBW. And Chris, let's start right there. We've got this mixed picture so far from bank earnings. How should investors be digesting that picture?"", ""CHRIS MCGRATTY: Sure. Thanks for having me back. What we've seen thus far in earnings and it's early is really-- we're going through a bottoming process for the traditional commercial banks. We're seeing net interest income or the top line revenue, that's in the process of bottoming. And that's a good thing because that destroyed about 25% of earnings last year."", ""The question that we're having is, how is the full effect of interest rates going to play through to credit quality, and that process is normalizing."", ""- And Chris, I'm interested, you know, obviously, for the banks we saw this late year rally there, they've moved-- some of those names have moved hard to the upside. How does valuation generally look to you for the sector, Chris, here?"", ""CHRIS MCGRATTY: Yeah, they're cheap banks are always cheap in my 20-year career, they've always been cheap. And that's because of the value aspect of the business the regulation. What's interesting is the speed at which the market rerated this group. We went from eight to nine times earnings, to 11 to 12 pretty instantaneously when the Fed-- the pivot in December."", ""And so what we think is fair value for the group right now is around 10 or 11 times. And there's a lot of work we've done with where the level of interest rates are in the multiples. So we had a big run into the year, it's not surprising to us that we've seen some of the air come out of it."", ""- And I'm curious then when it comes to the right multiple on banks following their earnings. What is the single biggest catalyst for further growth that the market may not be pricing in fully right now?"", ""CHRIS MCGRATTY: Right. I think the biggest uncertainty that we're looking at is how is the economy going to react on a lagged effect to higher interest rates, right. We saw 500 basis point increase in rates, that takes some time to go through the economy."", ""If the economy and the banks go through 2024 and asset quality turns to hold up and we think it will, that's the biggest rerating opportunity for the sector. Because I think a lot of conversations that we're still having is, how did this perform? How did this company? Or how did this industry perform during 2008?"", ""And now, that's a tough comparison. Things are different, a lot of the risk has moved out of the banks. But banks need to be tested, the balance sheets need to be tested from a credit perspective.""]"

And it got me thinking of all the good work you've done with your close friend, Jane Goodall.

We had 6 trillion trees, we've gone down to 3 trillion. Every trillion trees is 200 gigatons of carbon."", 'Now why that is important is you remember in third grade, these trees can take CO2 out of the atmosphere and convert it to oxygen. And we need to replenish our biodiversity. We need to take care of our oceans. We need to reduce overfishing, protect 30% of our oceans by 2030. We need to nurture our coral. We need to address the issues that are going on with plastic.', ""You know there's an incredibly important treaty that's about to be signed by the UN in regards to plastic. And this idea that we have so much plastic out there, and the plankton and the ocean are eating the plastic, and the fish are eating the plastic, and the plankton and we are eating the fish. And we all understand that. I don't think anybody-- it's not a mystery how the world cycle is."", ""And yeah, we need to take care of our planet. And this is an incredible part of what we're doing. And we also need an ecopreneur revolution.

That the business of business doesn't have to be just business, it can be about improving the world, and that business can be the greatest platform for change.

We're heading to $35 billion approximately in revenue this year."", ""And that idea that there have been so many presidents and administrations during that time, I guess, what I realized was administrations are going to change but our core values are not going to change.

So we're going to care about the trees and the oceans no matter who's in office."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Salesforce is a different company compared to one year ago. What has made it a different company?

And we realized we needed to take our capabilities up.', ""That's why we've improved our margins 1,000 basis-- more than 1,000 basis points in the last year, which is kind of incredible. And I don't think our financials have really been better, our products have never been more competitive. Our customers have never been more successful. And it's great to connect with them here at the conference."", ""And I think that management team that we were talking about, people like Brian Millham, who's my chief operating officer, and Amy Weaver is my chief financial officer have been the most loyal lieutenants, but also just phenomenal executives in terms of their ability to operate the business.

I think using your business as a platform for change is probably number one. I guess the thing that we did that was so great was one, our 1-1-1 model.', 'That when we started our company, we put 1% of our equity, 1% of our profit, 1% of our time into a foundation. It was very easy at the time because we had no employees, no stock. There was nobody. No activist investors. Nobody was giving me any business.', ""But that's turned into almost $1 billion in grants. We run 50,000 nonprofits for free on our service. We've been able to do almost 10 million hours of volunteerism all over the world. And we can have a huge impact. Even here at the conference, we run a program for kids where we teach them computer science and AI using our facilities. That our core values in our company are about giving back.

But everybody can do something. And if you can do one thing and you can create a culture of doing something, that's exciting for business.

While Slack's services focus on organizational communication software, Tableau's services focus on intelligent data and analytics dashboards abd MuleSoft's software focused on automation and analytics. The most important point here is that all these acquisitions have been playing a critical role in providing growth to Salesforce."", ""The slide above was taken from the company's most recent investor presentation in 2022. Apart from MuleSoft, Tableau and Slack were growing at least 8 times revenue, which was faster than Salesforce's revenue growth multiple at the time of 5.40.

On the most recent third-quarter earnings call with investors, Salesforce's management announced for the first time that 17% of Fortune 100 companies were already using its EinsteinGPT AI CoPilot, a competitor to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OpenAI-based AI copilot. I believe the launch of AI capabilities and automation in its software has been key for Salesforce to turn back into growth mode. The chart below shows the revenue growth in constant currency by business segment."", ""While the Platform segment saw a huge bump in year-over-year revenue with the early adoption of AI tools, the trend in adoption has sustained in AI and automation tools such as MulesSft and Tableau, leading to stronger year-over-year revenue growth. In my opinion, the advantages of having diversified revenue streams, such as the segmented model currently at Salesforce, are that it creates opportunities for higher margin expansion across the board by using economies of scale and keeping its cost profile under control. I believe this is highly beneficial to Salesforce's operating margins and free cash."", ""Per management's most recent forward-looking commentary, Salesforce is projected to grow 11% on a year-over-year basis. While those are still respectable gains, the real benefits for an investor will be seen in the company's margin expansion. The chart below shows how the company has gotten better with every year that goes by as it learns to drive more efficiency into its business and expand margins."", 'On the recent third-quarter call, management expressed immense confidence in moving ahead with achieving high-margin growth, with the chief financial officer saying, We view this as a floor, not a ceiling on our success, and we intend to continue our focus on operating margin.', 'I view these developments as very positive for the company, as they show more restraint in controlling expenses while leveraging the technology to grow the business further and deliver more free cash to investors.', ""According to estimates by FactSet, the S&P 500's earnings per share are expected to grow around 11% this year, which is quite strong for the index. Given these forward estimates, markets participants peg the index approximately at a forward premium of 19.5 versus this year's expected earnings. Salesforce's management is confident they will be able to grow their earnings by approximately 56% to $8.19 per share, driven by higher cost efficiency in expenses. Consensus estimates project Salesforce's earnings per share to grow by around 18%. Given that Salesforce has a history of beating earnings expectations by at least 1.95% in the past five years, I think management's forward-looking guidance and consensus estimates are quite reasonable to assume as the basis for my valuation. Per my calculations, I find a forward price-earnings ratio of 32 very reasonable in terms of its premium. This would give Salesforce's investors a further upside of at least 15.8%."", 'My outlook for Salesforce considers there will be no recessions or slowdowns this year. I expect there will be no recession this year, and enterprise spending will continue to be strong. Gartner projects that worldwide IT spending will rise by 8%, but a bigger tailwind to Salesforce is that Gartner expects much of that 8% to be driven by spending in software at 13.8% and IT Services at 10.4%, which are the industries it operates in.', 'Another risk that may impact Salesforce is its exposure to debt. Per its most recent quarter, the company has debt outstanding with a total carrying value of $9.4 billion, of which $1 billion was related to the 2024 senior notes due in the next 12 months. With a net cash and cash equivalent position of $11.86 billion, I am confident that Salesforce is in compliance with all debt covenants.', ""Salesforce's management has shown remarkable focus in controlling its expenses and expanding margins to return free cash to shareholders.

Leaders in artificial intelligence including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates weighed in this week at Davos, the gilded annual conference where billionaires hold forth on global problems. While all said they took the threat of artificial intelligence on elections seriously, there was a split in whether they thought major disruption was likely.Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella somewhat downplayed the risks. “It’s not like this is the first election where disinformation, or misinformation, and election interference is going to be a real challenge that we all have to tackle,” he said, speaking at Bloomberg House at Davos on Tuesday.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg', 'Florida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump', 'Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Say Buy the Dip After Treasury Rout', 'Gloom Over China Assets Is Spreading Beyond Battered Stocks', 'Hedge Funds Rake in Huge Profits Betting on Catastrophe Risk', 'Hong Kong Stocks at 36% Discount Show True Depth of China Gloom', 'Later in the day Altman echoed that sentiment but expressed more uncertainty. “I don’t think this will be the same as before,” he said. “It’s always a mistake to try to fight the last war.”Altman and Nadella spoke the day after the first major caucus of the US presidential elections, with former President Donald Trump scoring an easy win over his fellow Republicans. ChatGPT wasn’t available the last time the US went to the polls, and there’s growing concern that -- besides making it easier to write code or craft emails -- generative AI tools could be used to produce disinformation and faked images that unfairly sway voters. In a warning about what’s to come, videos featuring AI-generated deepfake voices of politicians spread widely ahead of the Slovak parliamentary elections last year. They were shared on sites including Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook and Instagram, and messaging apps like Telegram that include audio impersonating political opponents, Reset, a research group that looks at technology’s impact on democracy, said in a report at the time.One video included a fake, two-minute long clip of a party leader appearing to discuss buying votes. But the audio file was synthesized by an AI tool trained on samples of his voice. At Davos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted that with generative AI tools, “bad guys will be more productive,’’ speaking in an interview with Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua.', 'Meanwhile, Salesforce Inc. CEO Marc Benioff suggested social media poses a bigger risk to the democratic process than AI does. “Regulators have not done their job,” he said.', 'OpenAI, which counts Microsoft as its largest investor, is “quite focused,” Altman said, on reducing the potential for political misuse of its tools, such as ChatGPT and Dall-E.', 'Altman and Nadella attended a meeting in May with US Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss AI risks. OpenAI will soon release for testing a tool that can identify AI-generated content and will digitally watermark material generated by Dall-E, the startup said Monday. It reiterated that use of OpenAI models for political campaigning isn’t allowed.', '“Our mind is not at ease,” Altman said. “We’re going to have to watch this incredibly closely this year.”', 'As for how politics will impact AI, Altman was less concerned. “I believe that America is going to be fine no matter what happens in this election. I believe that AI is going to be fine no matter what happens after this election,” he said.', 'OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, Anna Makanju, said she’s encouraged by proposed regulation being put forward by President Joe Biden and the European Union. “What has struck me and has been really remarkable is that the conversation around AI has remained very bipartisan,” she said.', 'Altman agreed, sort of: “Both parties hate it.”', '--With assistance from Isabella Ward.', '(Updates with additional context about the US election and disinformation tactics throughout)', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'The Downfall of Diddy Inc.', 'How Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine', 'The Bitcoin Hype Is Back and About Just as Hollow as Before', 'Japan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Recently, the company announced it would be altering its keyboard in a significant way for the first time in 30 years.', ""Microsoft is adding a new key to the keyboard that will allow users to launch its Windows Copilot, Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) assistant. Effectively, Microsoft is hoping to use the modified keyboard to differentiate its brand and lead consumers to look at its computer hardware as an AI PC."", ""Despite the hype about the seemingly big change, investors shouldn't get too excited about this recent development."", ""AI is touted as being intuitive and smart. That leads to the obvious question: Why is a new key even necessary? Shouldn't Microsoft's Copilot know when it's needed and just pop up (the way Clippy, Microsoft's first attempt at a computer assistant, did) and offer suggestions when it saw you were writing a memo or resume? I'm being a bit facetious here (Clippy was a huge failure for Microsoft in the late 1990s), but there is a point to my complaint and a connection to the investing thesis around this stock."", ""There have been several changes in technology over the years that might have warranted a keyboard change. From the emergence of email to the rising popularity of instant messaging and social media, Microsoft didn't feel the need to tweak the keyboard in this way. Why now?"", ""The obvious answer is that the company is hoping to promote a new service it's offering to its clients in Copilot. But Microsoft's Copilot likely doesn't need a new key to awaken it. There is probably also some effort here to convince investors of its strong intentions regarding AI. This reason is more defensible, if a bit gimmicky."", ""It's easy to see why Microsoft might want to position itself as an AI stock, as that was a hot investing theme of 2023. However, investors should be careful not to overestimate the demand for Microsoft's Copilot. This service costs $30 per month, which is more than its Microsoft 365 business premium bundle. The latter costs $22 per user and includes desktop apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook."", ""It's not a cheap price for a service that can help users summarize meetings and compile information from emails, chats, and other files. Whether it's revolutionary enough to command a significant market share at a time when there are free AI services available is questionable. The integration with Microsoft's desktop apps is a key differentiator, versus using a web version of OpenAI's ChatGPT, but whether that's enough of a reason to justify the price tag is the big question."", ""While the company projects that AI could generate $10 billion in annual revenue for Microsoft, that's still a fairly modest chunk of the company's top line. Over the past four quarters, Microsoft's revenue has totaled $218 billion."", ""What makes Microsoft worth nearly $3 trillion is the strength and dominance of its other businesses. Microsoft Azure, Windows, Xbox, and the company's office suite of products are all examples of Microsoft's broad business and the different ways it can generate long-term growth. AI is definitely going to play a role in that, but investors should be careful not to overestimate its potential -- at least not yet."", ""Adding a key to its existing keyboard appears to be a way for Microsoft to help draw attention to its AI efforts, but there will be no shortage of competition in this new battleground. Amazon, Alphabet, and many pure-play AI stocks will be offering AI-related products and services, as well. While Microsoft has invested approximately $13 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, it's still in the early innings and far too early to tell which companies will come out on top as AI continues to evolve."", ""Microsoft is a safe long-term investment and can be a great option for retirees, but it's not a growth stock I would buy at today's inflated valuation. At nearly 38 times the company's trailing earnings, investors are paying a big premium for the business, which I don't believe is justified. It appears to me that investors may be overestimating the impact AI will have on Microsoft's business and justifying its valuation that way."", ""Until Microsoft proves that AI is going to be a massive game changer for its business, I'd consider buying other tech stocks instead."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Thank you for joining us for the Walgreens Boots Alliance earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. I'm Tiffany Kanaga, vice president of global investor relations. Joining me on today's call are Tim Wentworth, our chief executive officer; and Manmohan Mahajan, our interim global chief financial officer."", 'In addition, John Driscoll, president of U.S. healthcare; Rick Gates, senior vice president and chief pharmacy officer at Walgreens; and Tracey Brown, president of Walgreens retail and chief customer officer, will participate in Q&A. As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 2 and those outlined in our latest Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

These measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and the reconciliations are set forth in the press release.', 'You may also refer to the slides posted to the investors section of our website for reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed during this earnings call. I will now turn the call over to Tim.', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. When I joined you for the last earnings call in October, I had not yet begun my role as CEO, but I shared how I believe that leading WBA is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with a tremendous brand, legacy, and neighborhood presence. Today, 10 weeks into my tenure, I am even more certain of my decision. I am pleased to be here today to share our results, our outlook, and my broader convictions around how we can build on our strong pharmacy foundation to partner across healthcare services and drive sustainable value.', 'As you are by now aware, WBA started fiscal 2024 with on-plan results despite a weak retail environment in the U.S. First quarter adjusted EPS came in at $0.66, reflecting execution and cost discipline in U.S. retail pharmacy, continued strong performance in international, and progress with profitability initiatives in U.S. healthcare.', 'We are maintaining full year adjusted EPS guidance against a challenging backdrop. I must give credit here to the hard work and dedication of our teams. We are navigating the accumulating consumer pressures from inflation and depleted savings, and somewhat slower-than-anticipated market trends in pharmacy script volumes, including impacts from a weaker respiratory season and Medicaid redetermination. Retail customers in the United States are under stress and making deliberate choices to seek value, evidenced in our own brands up 90 basis points in the quarter, while demand for seasonal and discretionary categories remains weak.', ""At the same time, our teams executed well during the quarter on delivering pharmacy services, including vaccines, and maintaining our overall share of script volume in the U.S. International was once again a bright spot in the quarter, building on last year's solid growth. Upside was led by Boots U.K., with further share gains in retail, while both retail and pharmacy delivered gross profit improvement despite inflationary cost pressures. Germany also achieved share gains."", 'In U.S. healthcare, we are on track to achieve significant year-on-year profit improvement. VillageMD is rapidly realigning operating costs with sales. The team is executing on several initiatives, from revenue cycle management to procurement, with operational actions spanning the organization.', ""As VillageMD focuses on increasing density in their highest opportunity markets, remember the previously announced plans to optimize their footprint and exit approximately 60 clinics in nonstrategic markets. As of today, they are nearly halfway there, having already exited 27. Additionally, VillageMD is driving patient panel growth and achieved 23% year-over-year growth in full risk lives and 9% growth in fee-for-service volumes. Work is underway to implement targeted marketing efforts, leveraging Walgreens' expertise and patient touchpoints, and we expect benefits over time as we learn and further develop our provider-based risk strategy."", 'So, macroeconomic conditions are clearly difficult for retailers, and I fully acknowledge the structural headwinds in our core pharmacy business and the growing pains in our healthcare segment. None of this is a surprise to me. I came to WBA eyes wide open, with a clear mandate to act with everything on the table in terms of putting our business on the right track. In that context, we are taking swift actions to rightsize costs and increase cash flow across the company.', 'We remain on pace toward $1 billion in cost savings this year. Our U.S. organizational efforts have resulted in a planned headquarter support office workforce reduction of approximately 20%. Over the past two months, we have prioritized projects and capital spend to focus on the customer-facing activities that matter most.', 'First quarter capex was over $100 million lower year over year, on track to a $600 million reduction for the full year. We also remain on schedule to deliver $500 million in working capital benefits in fiscal 2024. An additional meaningful and necessary step to strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position, today, we are announcing a 48% reduction in our quarterly dividend payment to $0.25 per share starting in March. This action will free up capital to invest in driving sustainable growth in the pharmacy and healthcare businesses, as well as paying down debt.', 'At the same time, we will continue to deliver a competitive dividend yield as the board and I continue to view the dividend as a critical component to overall attractiveness of WBA to many of our shareholders. Our financial flexibility is also supported by other strategic actions, with some already underway and others under consideration. In November, we monetized an additional portion of our Cencora stake with nearly $700 million of proceeds. We also took advantage of the higher interest rate environment to secure a full buy-in for the Boots pension plan with legal and general to ensure the benefits of all 53,000 members.', ""A buyout scheduled in calendar 2025 will eliminate the company's plan obligations and commitments. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate our existing portfolio, sharpening our strategic focus on the U.S. retail pharmacy and healthcare, with our remaining investments in Cencora, BrightSpring, and other minority interests providing financial flexibility. Let me be clear."", ""We have hard work ahead of us in our journey to simplify and strengthen WBA, but also good momentum with important early actions that we've taken. And there are a number of building blocks already in place for a sharper healthcare strategy, positioning us well for long-term profitable growth. Walgreens is a dependable, trusted, and convenient local healthcare destination for patients, and we have the ability and, frankly, the market mandate to be a valued, independent partner of choice in healthcare services. As John Driscoll detailed last quarter, we are leveraging our local presence to engage with patients across our thousands of stores and through our assets across the care continuum on behalf of payers, providers, and pharma to help them achieve their objectives at scale."", 'I can tell you from my early days with the team and from meetings with our partners and prospects, there is a lot to be excited about here. But our competitive advantage is not just our neighborhood footprint and convenience with 10 million customers visiting us at Walgreens in store or online every day. Our stores are access points on the best corners in America. And more specifically, we have over 85,000 people on our teams who directly engage with patients and are trusted providers in their communities.', ""Walgreens has the unique ability, through our well-established physical presence and iconic brand, for our people to drive trusted, meaningful connections. We are enabling pharmacists to spend less time on tasks and more time on meaningful interactions and providing essential care, from health screenings to immunizations to diagnostic testing and treatment. Our network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce workflow pain points, and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to our patients and partners. You'll remember in October, we mentioned a pause in the rollout to optimize productivity."", ""We are happy with our continued progress and the importance of these centers in our overall strategy. We are also piloting virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, further increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility, and extend our pharmacists' reach. Finally, we are partnering with academia and, specifically, key schools of pharmacy to explore ways to attract, recruit, and create a dynamic workplace for the next generation of pharmacists. Our relationships with pharmacy deans are integral to our strategy and can help us advance the profession, and so we are forming an advisory council to guide us in our transformation."", 'I look forward to personally working with the deans, with our first meeting in March, to ensure Walgreens is the preferred employer in the pharmacy space. And I want to thank our pharmacy teams for their tireless efforts on the front lines of healthcare delivery in this country. Let me give you one example of how we can build on our established assets in a capital-efficient way to expand services and support patients and partners: our clinical trials offering. We are partnering with pharma companies and leveraging our community presence and patient engagement to help drive greater patient diversity in clinical research.', 'In a short span, we are already improving participation and equity at double the national average. To date, we have signed over 25 contracts, with a robust pipeline of opportunities ahead. Shields is another example of our strength serving hospital systems and has consistently delivered strong margin accretive results ahead of plan. Sales were up 27% in the first quarter, driven by meaningful growth at existing customers, as well as new partner contract signings.', 'We expect Shields to continue to leverage and benefit from the rapid growth in the broader specialty market and our intense focus on accelerating hospital-owned specialty pharmacy programs. Our specialty pharmacy assets will be an important focus going forward. And while we have work to do, we are pleased to be executing our next steps with gene and cell therapy. The FDA anticipates approval of more than 20 gene and cell therapies by 2025, and this is an exciting opportunity for patients with rare conditions and for Walgreens specialty pharmacies.', 'In the coming months, you will hear more from us on our initiatives in specialty. Finally, let me touch on reimbursement models and dynamics. We continue to see the benefits of more comprehensive and responsive discussions with payers as they are realizing the broad set of value drivers that WBA can deliver. We are committed to and entering into pay-for-performance contracts beyond core dispensing as we advance our adherence and outcomes capabilities within our pharmacy platform.', ""In addition, we welcome and will work with payer and PBM partners on any model that recognizes and reimburses pharmacies for the unmatched value we provide patients, including pharmacy services, as well as those models that can ensure more transparency and predictability in reimbursement. With that, I'll hand it over to Manmohan to review our financial results and recent execution in further detail."", 'Manmohan Mahajan -- Interim Global Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Overall, first quarter results were in line with our expectations. Sales increased 8.7% on a constant currency basis. U.S.', 'retail pharmacy grew at 6.4%. International delivered 4.4% growth. And U.S. healthcare pro forma sales increased 12%.', 'Adjusted EPS of $0.66 declined 44% on a constant currency basis, mainly driven by lower U.S. retail sales and a 21-percentage-point headwind from a higher adjusted effective tax rate. Strong international growth and improved profitability in our U.S. healthcare segment positively impacted adjusted EPS.', 'GAAP net loss for the first quarter included $278 million after-tax charge for fair value adjustments on variable prepaid forward derivatives related to Cencora shares. Remember, in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $5.2 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits and $0.9 billion after-tax gain on sale of Cencora shares. Now, I will cover the U.S. retail pharmacy segment.', 'Sales increased 6.4% versus the prior-year quarter, driven by brand inflation in pharmacy and higher contributions from pharmacy services. Sales growth was partially offset by a 6.1% decline in the retail business. AOI declined 37.2% year on year, mainly driven by lower retail sales volume and margin, including higher levels of shrink. AOI was positively impacted by execution in our pharmacy services and progress on cost savings initiatives.', 'Let me now turn to U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy comp sales increased 13.1%, mainly driven by brand inflation and higher contribution from pharmacy services. COVID-19 vaccines have now shifted to a commercial model, consistent with other vaccinations.', 'Comp scripts grew 1.8%, excluding immunizations, in line with the overall prescription market. The ongoing impact of Medicaid redeterminations and a weaker flu and respiratory season continue to negatively impact overall market growth. Third-party data showed flu, cold, and respiratory activity was down 13.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. Within pharmacy services, our vaccines portfolio, which includes flu, COVID, RSV, and other routine vaccinations, performed well in the quarter.', 'Pharmacy adjusted gross profit declined slightly in the quarter, with margin negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure, net of procurement savings, and brand mix impacts. Turning next to our U.S. retail business. Challenging macroeconomic conditions and an anticipated slow start to the cough, cold, flu season contributed to a weaker retail performance year on year.', 'Comparable sales declined 5% in the quarter. There are three main drivers. First, a weaker respiratory season had an impact of approximately 160 basis points through the health and wellness category. Cough, cold, flu serves as a primary trip driver.', 'As a result, we also experienced lower attachment sales due to the weaker season, which are incremental to the 160-basis-points impact. Second, customers continue to pull back on discretionary spending and actively seek out promotional opportunities. As a result, we saw an approximately 90-basis-points impact from weaker holiday seasonal sales. Lastly, our decision to close most of our stores on Thanksgiving this year to further support our store team members led to a headwind of about 60 basis points.', 'While these factors have resulted in lower sales across all categories, we experienced more pronounced declines in consumables and general merchandise and in health and wellness. Retail gross margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points due to higher shrink. Retail shrink continues to be a systemic issue across the retail industry. Turning next to the international segment, and as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers.', 'The international segment performed better than our expectations in the quarter. The total sales increased 4.4%, with Boots U.K. up 6.2% and Germany wholesale growing 3.7%. Segment adjusted gross profit increased by 7%, outpacing sales growth, with Boots U.K.', ""driving strong retail growth. Adjusted operating income grew 15%, including the impact from inflationary cost pressures. Let's now cover Boots U.K. in detail."", 'Comp pharmacy sales grew 0.8%. Comp retail sales increased 9.8%, with growth across all categories, led by beauty and health and wellness. We also saw a year-on-year growth across all store formats, with flagship and travel locations performing particularly well. Boots increased retail market share for the 11th consecutive quarter, led by beauty.', 'Boots.com sales increased 17.5% year on year and represented 19.2% of our U.K. retail sales. Turning next to U.S. healthcare.', 'U.S. healthcare segment results were in line with our expectations. This is the second consecutive quarter of significant improvement in AOI and adjusted EBITDA compared to prior year. First quarter sales of $1.9 billion increased by 95% compared to the prior year, reflecting the acquisition of Summit Health by VillageMD and growth across all businesses.', 'On a pro forma basis, segment sales increased 12%. VillageMD sales of $1.4 billion were up 14% on a pro forma basis. The year-on-year increase was driven by growth in full risk lives, better same-clinic performance, and increased productivity in the Summit Health multispecialty business. Shields increased sales by 27% as new health system contracts and expansion of existing partnerships led to a 42% increase in the number of patients and services in the quarter versus the prior year.', 'Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $39 million, reflecting investment in VillageMD, partly offset by profitable growth at Shields and CareCentrix. Adjusted EBITDA increased $84 million compared to last year, with improvement across all businesses. We are making progress to accelerate profitability at VillageMD. And profit growth from all of the businesses contributed positively in the quarter.', ""Turning next to cash flow. Overall, free cash flows were in line with our expectations. Operating cash flows in the quarter was negatively impacted by anticipated seasonal inventory build and timing of payer reimbursement. Capital expenditures declined by $104 million versus the first quarter of fiscal '23."", ""Free cash flow was down $671 million versus the prior year, driven by the phasing of working capital and lower earnings, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. As Tim mentioned, we are on track to reduce capital expenditures by approximately $600 million year over year and to deliver working capital improvement of $500 million. I will now turn to guidance. We are maintaining our fiscal '24 adjusted EPS guidance."", 'We expect certain incremental tailwinds and headwinds in a challenging environment compared to our prior outlook. On the tailwinds, with strong execution to date, we now expect pharmacy services to deliver ahead of our initial plan. We also anticipate an improvement in our full year adjusted effective tax rate as a result of tax planning initiatives, with a revised range of 15% to 17%, compared to the prior outlook of 19% to 20%. On the headwinds, first, we expect the pullback in consumer spending and shifting behaviors will continue to impact our retail sales in the U.S.', ""in the short term while improving in the second half. We now expect retail comp sales for fiscal '24 to decline low single digits compared to the prior outlook of flat. Second, we expect approximately $125 million in reduced sale and leaseback gains versus our prior outlook. As we explained in October, this is the last year of anticipated sale-leaseback transactions."", ""Lastly, we also forecast slightly lower overall market volume growth for prescriptions compared to our previous expectations. Importantly, as we build on the first quarter progress in U.S. healthcare, we continue to expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. This represents an increase of $325 million to $425 million over fiscal '23."", 'The improvement is mainly driven by actions taken to accelerate profitability at VillageMD, robust growth at Shields, and cost discipline. Next, I will discuss factors impacting the phasing of earnings in the second quarter versus second half of the fiscal year. In the second quarter, we will be lapping adjusted EPS of $1.16 in the prior-year quarter. Three factors are expected to have an outsized impact on the year-over-year comparison.', ""First, we anticipate lower contributions from sale and leaseback activity. Second, we're incorporating impacts of consumer pressures on spending and sentiment and higher shrink on our retail business. Lastly, we expect these headwinds to be partly offset by a lower tax rate in the second quarter due to the phasing of tax planning initiatives. Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal '24, there are four key drivers for our improving earnings profile."", 'First, as we have previously discussed, we expect actions to lower our cost base will continue to ramp over the year. Second, we expect U.S. healthcare segment profitability will scale over the balance of the year, mainly driven by benefits from optimizing the clinic footprint, growing patient panels and realigning cost at VillageMD, and growth across all of the businesses. Third, we cautiously expect modest level of retail market growth against an easier second half comparison.', 'Finally, our tax rate was elevated in the first quarter. We expect favorability in the remainder of the year. With that, let me now pass it back to Tim for his closing remarks.', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""To summarize what you've heard from us today, we executed on our plans in the first quarter despite the challenging environment, and we also recognize there is still plenty of work to be done. The future of healthcare and of this company both require innovative new thinking. My headline to you is that everything is on the table to deliver greater shareholder value. We have the experience and the license to deeply examine our business and make the changes that position us well going forward."", ""Having spent time with our team members and our business, I'm encouraged by the significant opportunity to build on our legacy pharmacy strength and our trusted brand to evolve healthcare and the customer experience. We are not pivoting away from our position as the premier neighborhood retail pharmacy, but we are instead redefining what we can do to help payers, providers, and pharma achieve their goals. The reasons I joined WBA weren't just validated in these discussions. They are even more true than I had anticipated."", 'I have a strong team in place to drive execution who are effectively working together to deliver for all of our stakeholders while I work through several leadership transitions. In the coming weeks and months, we look forward to engaging with you, our customers, our fellow teammates, and our shareholders, as we are listening, learning, and moving quickly to create sustainable value. Now, I would like to open the line for questions.', '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Lisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Good morning and thanks for all the comments, Tim. I want to go back to your comments around the reimbursement model. You talked about pay-for-performance. You talked about the unmatched value, transparency, predictability.', ""How much of that do you think can be driven by Walgreens and Walgreens putting a new model in place? And as we think about just what's happened with the margins in drug retail over a number of years, what do you think can be a sustainable margin when we think about the drug retail business?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Good morning, Lisa. Thanks. So, first of all, as it relates to sort of how much can Walgreens drive market shift, you know, I think we certainly, as a major retail player and partner to PBMs and health plans, are in a position to bring value to the table in different ways that they will look at and determine -- help them win in their marketplaces. And so, I actually think we can play a fairly significant role in the relationships that we have, the contracts that we write, and the risk that we're willing to take in terms of the value we know we will create at the back of the store with the way we can interact with patients on behalf of those payers."", ""So, I don't think -- as you know, any change in a reimbursement model is a speedy change. But I think there's very, very strong clear messaging in the marketplace from us and others that would point to the fact that the way that retail pharmacies will create value in the next 10 years isn't going to simply be lowering the cost of -- the unit cost of the drugs that we're purchasing and distributing because, quite frankly, that largely now is not where the real gains can be made for payers and for patients. And so, from our standpoint, we're going to drive hard at it. We can work inside of -- and we've proven, we're inside of cost-plus models now, transparent models now."", ""We have a very robust cash program. And we think we're a terrific partner to others that want to win in the marketplace with these more innovative models that they have talked about and that they are pushing into the market. So, I feel super good. Now, in terms of -- you know, I'm not going to give you guidance on the -- as you would expect, on the margins for drugs other than to say that most of the -- if you look at the innovation in reimbursement in pharmacy that's likely to evolve, it's likely to evolve in such a way that the margin per drug is going to be largely based on how much service do we provide the patient that's receiving it."", ""And I think we've seen what that looks like in models like specialty. We've also seen when it disconnects what it looks like. And those are things that we're working against as well, where we're not compensated for the kind of services we provide. And we are pretty confident that the value that we can build in what we call our pharmacy services, but also our use of pharmacists to help patients take the drugs and stay on them safely and get the benefits and make sure the payers are getting what they're paying for, we're super well positioned to evolve those models as a leader."", 'Lisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you and congrats on your first quarter.', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Good morning, guys, and I'll echo Lisa's sentiment. Welcome aboard. Tim."", ""I guess, Tim, as you look at the business from where you stand right now, you've kind of said that everything is on the table. But I guess, could you spend a little bit talking about what you think is part of the Walgreens core business, the WBA core business, and kind of what might be ancillary and kind of maybe talk about how you're spending your time and where you think your strategic focus is most important to be spent right now."", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Thanks, George. That's -- appreciate the question. That's a great way to ask what's on the table."", ""And from that standpoint, let me answer your question, though, because we have a terrific group of assets that I think are going to be, on a go-forward basis, critical. But again, let me be clear. I'm 60 days in. We have a lot of work to do."", ""You know, we're working to get our cash flows, our balance sheet, our -- you know, all of our financial models, you know, aligned with being able to invest in our company to growth -- to grow. The first and most easy answer is our stores. And so, lest anyone think that where we were headed was a meaningful pivot away from being committed to a community-based engagement model with patients both with what we do in pharmacy and what we do to create a great experience for them in the front of our store, that is central -- a central element to what we will have going forward, and that is not on the table. Now, what is on the table is what's the right footprint in stores."", ""And we've announced already that, for example, this year, we're going to optimize our footprint by roughly 200 stores, and we're on track to do that. We will continually look at sort of the model through the lens of where do we need to be and where do we not need to be and what is creating value and what is destroying value. So -- but there's no question for me that we are going to be a major community-based neighborhood point of engagement for patients with human beings touching human beings, which I believe is, in the long term, how healthcare in this country is going to evolve. Besides that, though, we very much -- and you've seen -- you know, I get asked, why did you come off the couch that you were sitting on to get back into the CEO chair? It was real simple."", 'Walgreens called me. I had had three years of experience during the worst pandemic hopefully in my life with the pharmacy services part of our business, with the vaccines that my family and I were able to obtain. And so, for me, I viewed Walgreens as a fundamental public health utility as much as a business and something that literally has the potential to be meaningful, not just in a pandemic, but on a go-forward basis. And we have proven that with our pharmacy services businesses.', ""So, we are clearly investing around being able to both free up pharmacists, centralize certain activities and so forth using technology, excuse me, to then expand the things that we can do in store, be they testing, be they -- including working with LabCorp, but also using our own employees, vaccines and adherence programs, and other things that we do to counsel patients. Besides that, though, we have a really terrific cluster of businesses in CareCentrix and in Shields, where we're adding value to payers in areas where they're taking risks and where they're looking for partnership. And those assets are, you know, in my first glance, providing real value to the marketplace and have potential synergy with one another and with our retail pharmacy model. So, again, backing all the way up, though, again, there are a number of other things there."", ""The clinical trials business that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, super interesting, leverages some of our assets, capital efficient. And I think that that's the way I'll zoom out here and just leave you with the thought that says, I don't want to detail every asset we have. We've got lots of really good stuff. We also have investments in things like VillageMD that we're actively managing."", ""But what I would say is this. The lens that we're going to put on these things is do they create sustained value for payers, patients, health systems, PBMs. And if they do, can we get a fair return for the capital that we're going to invest in them? And if the answer is we can't get a fair return, we're not a charity, so we won't do it. But I see a lot of opportunities for us to meaningfully create high return on capital investments in these services business."", ""And that's the -- I think the headline I put out there is that we are going to evolve our services, our strategy from a healthcare standpoint to a health services strategy, which I think a retail pharmacy basis for that. I thought a PBM basis was terrific to build a health services business. I think a retail pharmacy base is a fabulous base to build a health services business from because of the engagement."", 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'OK. And if I could have a quick follow-up, I guess. Do you think of the care delivery business as kind of core to the business in the way you frame the person-to-person aspect?', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'When you -- would you define when you say care delivery?', 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'The Village and Summit assets.', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, we like that investment. We're working closely with them. And as Manmohan mentioned in his prepared remarks, the -- there's no question that they have put themselves on a good path, both in terms of their costs and their footprint, getting to a place where they're going to be meaningfully growing and profitable. So, we like that as an investment."", ""I think that as a future growth area for us beyond the Village investment, which we're very committed to, you know, I would not expect to see us investing in additional primary care assets in our portfolio of investments."", 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Very helpful color. Thanks, Tim.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Charles Rhyee -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and welcome, Tim, back. Tim, I wanted to touch on sort of your comments around specialty. Obviously, given you're in specialty from your prior roles, we'd love to hear a little bit more about this."", ""You talked a little bit extensively about it and potentially the path for Walgreens to be a significantly bigger player in this segment. You know, if I'm not mistaken, I think Shields is one of the few specialty pharmacies that has, you know, sort of access to almost all the limited distribution specialty drugs in the market. And sort of given sort of the shifting channel dynamics in this market over the next few years, particularly with, you know, I would say, some ongoing regulatory scrutiny, you know, in this space, you know, what kind of opportunities do you think this could create for Walgreens and Shields, in particular?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks. I'll start, and then I'll actually let John speak a little bit more because John's been very close to the Shields business, which has just been a terrific great management team and a great partner to health systems. First, let me clarify one thing, which is that, actually, we -- Walgreens specialty have access to the limited distribution drugs and Shields has access to us. And so, what Shields is able to do is actually work on behalf of the health systems to build networks and to manage the patients and the pharmacy programs that are really important to these health systems."", ""If you look at their underlying economics, quite often, that can be, many times, the only place that they're actually earning a profit. And so, we become a very, very important partner. Our Walgreens specialty assets inside that mix, I'll speak to just for a second. You know, we have community of central fill."", ""We are building a gene and cell therapy because pharma has essentially indicated strong interest in working with us in that space. And so, we think we've got great core assets. I think that one of the things that's been underway under John and Rick working together has been really making sure that we've got those assets focused very, very pointedly on the payer market. And since I got here, we've had a number of wins where we were put into the network of large Blue Cross Blue Shield regional plans as a participant."", ""That's not sufficient from where I'm sitting, though. You know, we've got to be able to win more than our fair share of those patients based on the service that we provide, the cost we can deliver, and we're working through sort of our models to figure out what we need to do to enhance our access to patients. That being said, though, Shields is a key enabler to a specialty strategy as a potential component for these pharmacies. And, John, if you want to just give any additional color there."", 'John Driscoll -- President, U.S. Healthcare', ""I think you nailed it, Tim. I think the only thing I'd add is we're not just growing with payers. We're growing beyond Blue's plans with other payers. And it -- and what Shields does an exceptionally good job at in a growing market is leveraging a clinical pharmacy model which delivers more adherence and better outcomes."", ""And so, it's a -- it's really a great example, very -- where there's a lot of detail involved of we're being paid for performance, and that's growing in terms of building on Walgreens franchise with large hospital systems and small hospital systems around America. But it's based on execution, which I think there's still a lot of runway, both from a payer and from a health system perspective. And obviously, the underlying specialty drug market is only going to get larger and more complicated, which I think plays to the Shields' and the Walgreens' strengths."", 'Charles Rhyee -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Great. And if I could just follow up on George's question. Tim, you kind of said that you probably aren't looking to invest in more care delivery assets, kind of like VillageMD. But, you know, could we expect more type of partnerships with, you know, entities like Pearl as a way to kind of expand continued access to care?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes is the short answer. We recognize that VillageMD represents and City represent a fabulous sandbox for us to build services, test them, and, by the way, demonstrate that they perform and help them achieve their objectives while, at the same time, putting us in a position of growing. And from our perspective, that is a starting point to being a partner of choice for any number of -- you know, as you know, Village has certain geographies they're very deep in, but they're geographies they're not in at all. And there are large provider opportunities for us to partner in similar ways in those marketplaces to grow our business and, importantly, help them grow theirs."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Eric Percher -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', ""Thank you. On pharmacy, you know, we've been hearing from Walgreens that pharmacy services are the key to driving better reimbursement for several years. And it looks like we're seeing that in vaccines today, the broader reimbursement pressure continues. And you have a peer saying that you've hit a floor on unit cost offsets."", ""Independents are saying the same kind of can't go lower. Do you share the view that we've hit a floor, that reimbursement pressure is -- has reached, you know, a level you can't go past in '24 or '25? And perhaps more important, given your PBM experience, does Walgreens have the leverage needed to drive more fair reimbursement or new models?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, listen, in my 25 years of PBM, the floor just kept moving lower, not just for retailers, but frankly, for all the players in the system, right, whether that be rebates or acquisition costs, etc. And so, we don't accept that -- you know, we think that there is very little left, let's put it that way, in the tank in terms of if I'm a PBM and I'm trying to deliver value to my marketplace, the levers that I have include retail network design. And what my point would be is squeezing the retailer beyond sort of where it's economically sensible for the retailer, by itself, there isn't much left there. And so, to do that doesn't produce enough value for the PBM to go win on that basis."", ""It's way, way more effective to win on creation of more certainty around value beyond unit cost. So, I think we're close. I'm not going to say we're close to the floor, but we are in this -- and we've had a very successful 2024 negotiations with the various PBMs and are 95% along the way of being done for '24, and have some good indications for '25. And again, we are -- we believe we can help drive a transition in the marketplace over time to a more value-based model, which will frankly show well to -- through to the end users and the patients."", ""And so, from my standpoint, I'll never declare there's a floor. And as I've said to our team, guess what? You know, we still have to compete. You know, we don't get to not compete just because the reimbursement model changes. We will compete, though, on things that we're actually very good at and that we can control."", 'And I think that as I look forward in the next three or four years, we can play a leadership role in that in a way that helps PBMs win. Let me be clear. Our job is to help PBMs win. I want more prescriptions coming through our stores, and that does not happen simply by being a great patient experience.', ""It happens by being a great payer partner, and that's the place that we're going to be focused. And we are listening carefully and trying to understand what are the payers trying to do in order to, therefore, configure the places where we create value. And as you've seen, two very large PBMs have said at least -- and I think they're responding, it's really interesting to me, to more pull from the marketplace than we may have experienced historically as it relates to either pass-through or transparent models and, therefore, announcing these programs that they're putting out in the marketplace that we can play very, very effectively in. So, the fact that there may be more marketplace pull there only presents, for me, a sense of urgency for our team to do what we've already done and accelerate additional value creation that we can, A, be paid for; and B, that our payers can go out and win with."", 'Rick, do you want to --', 'Rick Gates -- Senior Vice President, Chief Pharmacy Officer', 'Yeah, Charles. This is Rick, and I --', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Rick will add some color.', 'Rick Gates -- Senior Vice President, Chief Pharmacy Officer', ""Yeah. Sorry, Eric. The one thing I'll add is that, you know, we've been very successful at making sure that we are negotiating straight and core dispensing as one rate, and anything else value add is a separate rate. So, when you think about pay-for-performance contracts or you think about any of our services like vaccinations or test, test and treat, those are completely separate reimbursements that we're getting."", ""So, we've been very specific on how we contract so that we can be laser-sharp on how we look at the unit economics of our script dispensing."", 'Eric Percher -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', ""That's where I was going. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Ann Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So, just, Tim, a follow-up on the reimbursement model because, obviously, it's a big focus for investors."", ""I think you mentioned in Lisa's question that you think it would take some time. Do you have a estimate on how long you would take it to implement? And maybe putting your payer hat on since that was the majority of your career, why do you think payers would be open to such a change? What would be the main drivers for them and maybe what would be the benefit for them longer term? And what would be the benefit for Walgreens longer term?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, how long to implement? As you know, PBM and health plan selling cycles are, you know, not short. And so, you know, what I would expect is to see material potential change within a year or two. And probably -- but you'd also see for new sales midyear for small groups and stuff that churns more regularly, I think you'd -- you could see a fairly quick uptake to the extent that the market is looking for this. And again, I say that cautiously because we've seen before with transparent model."", ""Remember in 2005, I think as a PBM, I wrote, you know, the -- we joined the Towers Watson collaborative, and it was -- we were doing traditional deals within six months alongside the transparent because the market actually didn't want the risk shifted to them. They wanted the risk being held by the PBM. So, in this case, though, I think that the plan designs that the market have largely evolved to are creating this underlying demand to give patients the pass-through or the cost-plus experience so that they don't have an odd surprise when they go to the pharmacy counter of paying more for the drug than actually they would if they were a cash payer. So, I do think that the employers don't like the employees coming into their benefits office asking questions about how good are my benefits, if, in fact, you know, this is my experience at the pharmacy counter, and that's causing some demand."", ""Again, I'd let the PBM speak for themselves as to why they've launched these programs, but I would suspect that that's a piece of it. I think as well, the regulatory environment continues to evolve. And I think that it is very appropriately responsive to some of the concerns that exist there. So, I don't think it's going to be -- you know, this is not a six-month implementation."", ""We are prepared and already have sat down and had conversations to support these models, and we could convert to a cost-plus model overnight. So, we are a willing player in terms of what we would need to do to compete and win patients on a cost-plus basis. Why payers would do it? Again, I think I've just -- I've answered that for you in terms of it comes down to providing a benefit in a labor market that's fairly tough competitive-wise to folks that are valued. And so, they want the benefit -- the pharmacy benefits, the most used benefit."", ""They want it to be valued, and they want it to be understood, and they don't want it to be confusing. And so, I think these models offer a pathway to achieve that. What's in it for us is being paid fairly for the services we're providing at the back of the store and not subsidizing in a large scale way the products that the patients are getting in a way that's not economic for us. And I think the big change there, if you go back, you know, there was an appropriate amount of incentive being created in the system to dispense generics for lots of obvious and good reasons."", ""If you go back 25 years ago, the generic wave was -- people didn't believe it would happen. We had to do generic sampling in the PBM industry to even convince physicians that they were OK to dispense and easy to dispense. And so, that's different now. You got 90-plus percent generic dispensing rates in most places."", ""And the need to cross-subsidize and force a -- essentially the profit onto the generic side in exchange for a subsidy on the brand, particularly with the new brands that are coming out, just doesn't work anymore for the pharmacies or, frankly, for the patients in high deductible plans. And so, I think those powers will align to force this time a set of changes around reimbursement that may well stick."", 'Ann Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you. Very helpful.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Kevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Thanks and thanks so much for taking my question. In your prepared remarks around guidance, you mentioned that your expectations were around market growth in the pharmacy maybe being a little bit lower now. I'd just love any clarity on what that meant and what might be driving that. And then secondly, a more strategic question for Tim, given your history and everything else as you think about pharmacy services, does it benefit Walgreens to actually own a PBM?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I'll turn the first part of your question over to Manmohan and then be happy to answer the second part."", 'Manmohan Mahajan -- Interim Global Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. As you think about the prescription market growth, as we shared the outlook in October, you know, our guidance was that we're going to grow in line with market on the prescription side. What we've continued to see in the first quarter is the market is growing at a lower pace, and that's really driven by two factors. First is the weaker respiratory season, and the second is the impact or continued impact of Medicaid redetermination."", ""So, as we're thinking about the full year now versus October, we expect the overall market growth to slow down roughly around 50 bps versus previous estimates."", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""And as it relates to owning a PBM, I don't think that that's the best path for us, quite frankly. We -- I love -- and you've heard me say this in past lives. I love being independent. I love being someone who can work across the ecosystem in a way that doesn't create anything but trust."", 'And having a small PBM -- you know, the economics of delivering really good service and really good costs favor large PBMs for really obvious reasons. They produce a lot of value by scale. And so, buying a second-tier PBM, for us, does not make sense. I would much rather work with every PBM than own a small one.', 'Kevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Understood. Can I ask a quick follow-up if possible?', 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure.', 'Kevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst', ""This morning, Lilly announced that -- a new program called LillyDirect. I don't even know if you guys are able to see it. But it sounds like something that maybe you could participate in. They're talking about having a third-party online pharmacy fulfillment services, and they're going to use existing pharmacy -- existing pharmacies to help dispense."", ""I don't know if you've had a look at that, but is that something that you're talking about in terms of some of the services you might be able to offer or work with something like this, or, you know, how would this impact Walgreens?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', ""No, it's a great question, and we did see it this morning. And, you know, my preface is, as I've mentioned, we can work inside of almost any reimbursement model and be a service provider to payers, as well as patients, as well as pharma. With that said, I can toss it over to Rick, who can speak a little bit as it relates to sort of how we think about that program and others like it that may have evolved in the market."", 'Rick Gates -- Senior Vice President, Chief Pharmacy Officer', 'Yeah. I think, Tim, you hit I think what we can talk about right now. I think what I would say is that, obviously, transparency for consumers and anything that lowers drug costs to consumers, we think, is a good thing. And so, obviously, we are supportive of those types of programs.', 'We work with all of our partners, be it payer, PBM, or pharma partners, in order to help deliver against those.

Just maybe double-clicking on what you've talked about in terms of the pay-for-performance contracts that you've done so far, can you tell maybe, and maybe this is a question for Tim and for Rick, like sort of where the current focus on the contracts that you've signed has really focused on those contracts? And then as we think about the total opportunity, like do you have a sense of like what percent of those contracts like have some sort of element of that now and sort of as we think about the broader opportunity for that to improve going forward? Thank you."", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. I will let Rick answer, other than to say I had a conversation last week with the CEO of a very, very large payer who wanted to sit our teams down to actually look at 2025 and how we may work together, particularly on Medicare Advantage, with them. And so, you know, there is a lot of -- some of the other dynamics in the marketplace that are macro now are going to then bubble back through our contracting process and the kind of conversations that we can come to the table creatively with. Rick, in terms of the current state of play, do you want to address that?', 'Rick Gates -- Senior Vice President, Chief Pharmacy Officer', ""Yeah. And I would just say that, you know, obviously, most of the pay-for-performance contracts still sit within the Medicare Part D space. And so, obviously, we not only contract on specific deliverables, but we obviously plan operationally on how we're going to deliver against the ones that make sense so that we can deliver value within the ecosystem. We are starting to see in the Medicaid space that they are starting to have contracts come through."", 'And obviously, generally, then it would move into the commercial space. So, I think just to reiterate what Tim said, I think we are having conversations.

I'd be curious about your perspective on market share opportunities in this model."", ""Is it status quo given it's a line of one of your peers, or is there a way to structure this to increase relative attractiveness or kind of gain some share as well?"", 'Tim Wentworth -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. I appreciate the question. The way that we view every opportunity is how do we gain share with it. I -- what I like is competing on unit price is a fairly straightforward exercise, and we continue to do that.', ""Competing on the underlying cost to deliver the basic service is, you know, something, again, that we understand and live with. Hard to differentiate on those two. We'll always be the low-cost provider. That's one of the goals that we have and we are driving toward in our pharmacy business."", ""But what I really like is the models that are being discussed and evaluated and I think being pulled into the market will allow differentiation on how well you leverage other assets and what assets you have. And in that respect, we've got a 123-year head start on some folks as it relates to building out a trusted brand that patients will respond to. You know, I'm really compelled by the kind of response that we are able to get on behalf of payers, for example, in our Walgreens health business, when we use our brand and have our pharmacist call a patient and suggest to them on behalf of one of our plans that a flu shot would be a good idea for a Medicare Advantage patient, or that perhaps complete -- coming to the store and getting a Cologuard test and actually completing it and showing that we can get 50%-plus response rates even with something as challenging as a Cologuard test. To me, that shows the kind of thing that we can do better than anybody that will differentiate us as these contracts with payers broaden out from pure unit cost."", 'And so, I feel really, really good about where we sit as an ability to do that, to gain access to patients and, therefore, gain share.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.

You've seen the changes we've already been supported to make, and we have additional things that we are looking to do."", ""We are on a path, but we are nowhere near the -- even the halfway point of the kind of things that we believe we can do long term to build a really powerful health services company on the back of and leveraging an excellent community asset that today we call a retail pharmacy. And so, from that standpoint, the exciting thing for me is not only that we are on that path and that the results so far have been what we would have hoped for despite being very challenging and having to make some very, very difficult decisions. But to me, the thing that I go home and get excited about every day is after we talk to payers and we talk to the marketplace, we talk to pharma and we find out the level of need and interest they have in Walgreens being a preferred partner.

(NASDAQ:WBA) recently completed a leadership transition with a new CEO. One of his first acts was to cut the dividend by 48%. Thus, the company, which has paid increasing dividends for 47 years, is no longer a ""Dividend Aristocrat.""', ""The new CEO of Walgreens is Tim Wentworth. He brings nearly three decades of health care leadership experience to the company, having recently served as the CEO of Evernorth, Cigna's (NYSE:CI) health services platform, and previously as the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States. Before that, he held positions at Mary Kay, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and RCA Records."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with WBA.', ""Wentworth's appointment is part of Walgreens' efforts to position itself more of a health care company than a retailer and lead its next phase of growth into a customer-centric health care organization. He officially assumed the role on Oct. 23, 2023."", 'Walgreens has been through a tumultuous decade as the company struggles to find its footing in a changed market. Over the past 10 years, the advent of e-commerce, online and mail-order pharmacies and the increasing power of pharmacy benefit managers has shifted the power balance in the pharmaceutical ecosystem against retailers such as Walgreens. Its stock has steadily lost its value; it is now almost 75% below its high.', 'In his remarks during his first earnings call on Jan. 4, Wentworth addressed analysts, highlighting the challenging retail environment and economic pressures faced by Walgreens. Despite the difficulties, the first-quarter results showed resilience, with adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share. The U.S. Retail Pharmacy demonstrated cost discipline, while the International segment, notably Boots UK, performed well. The U.S. health care segment, VillageMD, showed progress in cost realignment and achieved growth in full-risk lives.', ""He said that to navigate economic challenges, the company is taking swift actions, including workforce reduction, cost-saving measures and a 48% reduction in the quarterly dividend. Strategic actions, such as monetizing investments and evaluating the portfolio, aim to strengthen the long-term balance sheet. The CEO expressed confidence in building on the company's health care services, emphasizing the unique advantage of their physical presence and an engaged workforce. Acknowledging the industry's headwinds, Wentworth outlined ongoing initiatives, including the expansion of services like clinical trials, shields and specialty pharmacy, anticipating Food and Drug Administration-approved gene and cell therapies. The company is also engaging in discussions with payers for more comprehensive reimbursement models that recognize the value provided by pharmacies beyond dispensing.Emphasizing the need for innovative thinking in both health care and the company's future, he conveyed a commitment to exploring all options to enhance shareholder value. While maintaining the identity of Walgreens as a premier neighborhood retail pharmacy, the focus is on redefining the role to support payers, providers and pharma in achieving their goals. The CEO expressed optimism about building on the company's pharmacy strength and trusted brand. With a strong team is in place to drive execution, the company is open to changes to position itself effectively. He said the leadership team is eager to engage with customers, teammates and shareholders to listen, learn and swiftly create sustainable value.During the call, Interim Chief Financial Officer Manmohan Mahajan summarized the company's performance for the quarter. He said first-quarter results were in line with expectations as sales increased 8.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in U.S. Retail Pharmacy (6.4%), International (4.4%) and U.S. Healthcare pro forma (12%)."", 'Adjusted earnings per share, however, declined 44% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower U.S. retail sales and a higher adjusted effective tax rate. The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment experienced a 6.4% sales increase, but a 37.2% decline in adjusted operating income due to lower retail sales volume and margin. The U.S. Pharmacy unit reported a 13.1% increase in comp sales, driven by brand inflation and higher contributions from pharmacy services. The International segment exceeded expectations with a 4.4% sales increase, led by Boots UK. The U.S. Healthcare segment showed improvement with sales increasing 95%, driven by the acquisition of Summit Health and growth across all businesses. Adjusted Ebitda also increased, reflecting progress in VillageMD and profit growth from other businesses.', 'As a result, Mahajan said the company maintains its fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance, expecting tailwinds from pharmacy services and improved tax rates, but faces headwinds from consumer spending pullback, reduced sale and leaseback gains and slightly lower market volume growth for prescriptions. The U.S. Healthcare segment is expected to achieve breakeven adjusted Ebitda at the midpoint of the guidance range, representing a significant improvement over the previous fiscal year. The second quarter is anticipated to be impacted by lower contributions from sale and leaseback activity, consumer spending pressures and higher retail shrink, partially offset by a lower tax rate. The company anticipates improving earnings in the second half of the year, driven by ongoing cost reduction efforts, scaling profitability in the U.S. Healthcare segment, modest retail market growth and a lower tax rate.', 'The average stock forecast for Walgreens Boots Alliance in the next 12 months is $28.09. This price target corresponds to an upside of 15.78%. The range of stock forecasts for Walgreens is $20.20 to $47.25. Based on the ratings of 24 analysts, the consensus recommendation for Walgreens is hold.', 'Analysts are only predicting minimal earnings per share growth in the next three years, thus a forward price-earnings ratio of around 7 seems appropriate for now. The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator with standard inputs shows the stock is undervalued. However, Walgreens in recent years has shown very low predictability, so this valuation should be taken with a dose of skepticism.', 'The recent quarter was decent with all three segments delivering good performance. A new CEO has taken charge and the dividend has been ""right sized."" This was both expected and accepted by the market as a fait accompli given the drop is the value of the stock. The company continued its transition towards scaling up health care by closing the acquisition of urgent care provider Summit Health. Walgreens is the second-largest pharmacy operator in the U.S. (after CVS (NYSE:CVS)) with about 8,800 locations and thus enjoys a good network effect and reach to the U.S. population. Its main long-term strategic challenge is to build up its U.S. Healthcare Services primary care clinic business and seek synergies of the same with its extensive retail pharmacy operation, while fending off competition from mail-order pharmacies and resisting the squeezing of gross margins by increasingly powerful PBMs (who themselves are controlled by health maintenance organizations.) The local clinics would be co-located with physical pharmacies or near them, offering consumers convenience. At the core of this strategy is the launch of Walgreens Health, a technology-enabled model designed to offer personalized health care to consumers. This model will be available in various settings, including in-store, at home, in doctors\' offices and through mobile apps.', 'The aim is to work with payers and providers to enhance consumer experiences, improve health outcomes at reduced costs while delivering profitable revenues to Walgreens. The company has acquired VillageMD and CareCentrix to bolster its capabilities in primary and post-acute care and now Summit Health. These investments will particularly benefit high-risk patients with chronic conditions, which are high-cost areas for HMOs and where Walgreens think it can add value.', ""With his extensive background working with PBMs and HMOs, Wentworth should be able to guide the company to deliver better value from a HMO perspective, who are now the company's biggest customers. Walgreens needs to deliver demonstrated superior benefits to its customers and health care consumers via its physical pharmacy locations and clinics versus lower-cost mail-order pharmacies. This would help it get back in favor with HMOs as a preferred service provider with a broad offering.While recent revenue growth looks healthy, profitability has been suffering with net earnings, owner earnings and free cash flow per share trending down."", 'Profit margins have also been heading downward for many years, showing the business model is in trouble. The biggest immediate problem area is the ""front shop"" of the pharmacies where sales and profits have been declining. While Walgreens offers it customers convenience of picking up prescriptions and shopping in the same location, high inflation and prices has made the front store uncompeitive as compared to other merchants like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).

However, retail businesses with large brick and mortar operations, like Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) continue to thrive. Therefore, the question remains whether Walgreens will be able to find its groove and thrive or go the way of once great retail names like Sears, K-Mart and J.C. Penney, who could not evolve.Walgreens\' stock is currently depressed, trading in significantly undervalued territory. The new CEO and his leadership team have their work cut out for them. The company\'s first priority should be to restore profitability to its operations. I think this is doable in spite of intense competition as the fundamentals of the company are quite healthy and it has a huge distribution network. The company, due to its size, has enormous operating leverage and network effect. It also has the secular trend of aging demographics working in its favor. It is a signficant player in the U.S. health care sector, which is about 18% of the U.S. gross domestic product. Some early ""green shoots"" are starting to appear, with the company posting growing Ebit per share numbers for two quarters in a row after a string of negative numbers. Let us see if this trend is sustained.', 'If the company can get back to the level of operating profits it had even five years ago, the stock can double from here. In fact, the stock was much more than that, at around $71, five years ago. However, investors need to see clear evidence of progress from the company to feel confident and get behind the stock. To me, recovery in operating margins is a key metric to watch. Walgreens is very much a ""show me the money first"" stock. Thus, I rate it as a hold for now.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

SAM has been benefiting from the progress of its Beyond Beer strategy, the premiumization of the beer industry and robust trends for its twisted tea brand. The company’s innovation, intensified attention to pricing and product portfolio expansion efforts bode well.SAM benefited from solid price realization and procurement savings in third-quarter 2023, which more than offset increased inflationary costs. Its third-quarter 2023 top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.Shares of Boston Beer have risen 16.9% in the past six months against the industry and the Consumer Staples sector’s declines of 7.6% and 2.2%, respectively. The company’s shares have also outpaced the S&P 500’s growth of 5.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s earnings suggests growth of 4% from the year-ago period’s reported number.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'SAM is on track with the growth of its Beyond Beer category.

Its advancement in the non-beer categories, including ciders and hard seltzer, as well as brand-building efforts, is expected to fortify its position in the market.Boston Beer has made successful innovations in craft beer, hard cider and iced tea categories over the years.

The company expects the trend to continue for the next several years.', ""SAM's focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. Boston Beer is keen on bringing excitement to the Truly brand’s core flavors through innovation. The firm expects to improve Truly brand’s trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation and strong distributor support and retail execution. The company's Truly flavored bottle Vodka and Truly Vodka Seltzer have been performing well.Twisted Tea is the brand that drove the most growth for Boston Beer in the third quarter. Being one of the fastest-growing brands, Twisted Tea rose in double-digits and emerged as the number one brand in FMB in 2022 by increasing 3 share points.Improved geographic, channel and package distribution; effective brand-building campaigns; increased media investment; and optimized packaging design have been aiding the performance of the Twisted Tea brand. Its growing brand awareness and household penetration also bode well. The company further expanded its light portfolio offerings with a new variety pack available in select highly developed markets and has received positive feedback for the same.SAM recently announced the testing of the higher ABV version of Twisted Tea, called Twisted Tea Extreme, in select markets this summer. Consequently, the brand is likely to witness strong double-digit growth for the remainder of 2023."", 'In recent years, Boston Beer has implemented strategic pricing actions that have boosted its position in the competitive landscape. Craft beer enthusiasts are known for their willingness to pay a premium for unique and high-quality brews. SAM has leveraged this consumer mindset by strategically pricing its products to reflect the craft beer experience it offers.The company is optimistic about continued pricing gains in the near term. It estimates price increases of 2-3% for 2023 versus the 1-3% growth mentioned previously. It anticipates positive price realization in the fourth quarter, but at a lower level due to lower third-quarter price increases from the prior year.', 'Boston Beer has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category and the demand for the Truly brand in recent quarters. The slowing hard seltzer trends hurt the company’s depletions to some extent in third-quarter 2023.

Consequently, it provided an adverse volume view for 2023 and lowered the earnings per share guidance.Nonetheless, the company’s focus on improving Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on the core business, smart brand innovation and strong distributor support and retail execution bodes well.

These next-generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research. The company expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022.

It consolidated these businesses to form the Wellness and Healthcare category on Mar 31, 2022.', ""Philip Morris' ability to leverage robust pricing power has been providing some cushion against soft cigarette shipment volumes. The addictive nature of cigarettes allows the company to pass on higher prices to consumers, supporting revenues. Pricing is likely to remain a driver in the forthcoming periods as well.Incidentally, Philip Morris has been witnessing low cigarette volumes. Cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic headwinds like inflation on Adult Tobacco Consumers’ disposable income has been affecting cigarette industry volumes. In the third quarter of 2023, Philip Morris’ cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.5% to 161.1 billion units.Apart from this, high costs are a concern. On its third-quarter earnings call, Philip Morris stated that it expects to make additional growth-oriented investments in 2023, including the commercialization of ILUMA. Though beneficial in the long run, these investments are likely to weigh on margins in the near term.However, strong pricing and transformation toward a smoke-free future pave a solid path for PM’s growth.

With a market cap north of $25B, we expect a narrow pool of potential candidates. We see strategic candidates as more likely than a financial partner... We view Ansys\' position as a pure play simulation leader, minimizing potential integration hurdles. Recent large software M&A appear less bound to valuation ratios due to volatile pre/post-pandemic comps, but rather 2021 levels, which would put a range of $400 in play.""', ""The analyst's projected price forecast of $400 represents a potential 30% upside from where shares were traded before rumors of the potential sale broke out. It's worth noting that most sales are executed at a premium, and the stock is likely up in anticipation that existing shareholders can exit at a higher value."", ""ANSYS is down 7.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $327.41 per share it is trading 9.8% below its 52-week high of $362.88 from December 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ANSYS's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,084."", ""Do you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

People looking for that daily energy boost -- especially younger people -- are turning to carbonated energy drinks like Red Bull over soda, coffee, and tea.', 'This trend is predicted to only continue with analysts expecting the global energy and sports drink market to hit $233 billion in annual spending by 2027, up from $159 billion in 2021.', 'Monster Beverage has been one of the big beneficiaries of this trend as the owner of one of the leading energy drink brands worldwide.', 'Aptly named, the company has produced monster returns for shareholders. Since the mid-1990s, shares have risen by over 150,000%, absolutely crushing the broad market over that time frame.', 'But there is a new entrant to the energy drink industry, and it has started to take market share from the likes of Monster Beverage and Red Bull. Enter Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), the third-largest but fastest-growing energy drink brand in the United States. Its stock is up close to 5,000% in the last five years, handily outperforming both Monster and the S&P 500.', ""In 2023 alone, Celsius stock was up 57%. Is this explosive growth stock set to crush the market again in 2024? Let's investigate further."", ""The key driver behind Celsius stock's gains has been explosive revenue growth. The company has found a perfect niche with a health-focused energy drink brand, positioning itself as a superior product for people who care about exercise and nutrition."", ""Third-quarter sales were up 104% year over year to $385 million with over $1.1 billion in revenue generated over the past 12 months. Remarkably, five years ago, Celsius's trailing-12-month revenue was just $55 million. As you can see, its brand has caught fire, especially in North America, which is the source of over 95% of the company's sales."", 'With this increasing scale, Celsius has shown some impressive margin expansion. Through the first three quarters of 2023, gross margin climbed 780 basis points to 48.1% with the most recent quarter hitting an all-time high of 50.4%. With increasing leverage on its overhead costs and expanding gross margins, Celsius should be able to expand its bottom-line net margin at an impressive clip, as long as revenue keeps growing quickly.', 'Even with this impressive growth, Celsius is still significantly smaller than rival Monster Beverage, which reported $6.9 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Monster is a global brand, while Celsius has mainly been a phenomenon in North America.', 'Going global with a packaged-goods brand is complicated. Luckily, Celsius has a new partner in PepsiCo to help with global distribution.', 'In exchange for a minority stake in Celsius, Pepsi now carries Celsius products as part of its massive distribution network, helping the smaller brand expand both at home and abroad. Importantly, this can get Celsius in prime slots at convenience stores and other shops that sell energy drinks, which is typically an advantage that incumbents like Red Bull have.', ""Celsius's international revenue grew 56% year over year in the third quarter. Investors should expect this rapid growth to continue or even accelerate thanks to the PepsiCo partnership."", ""If Celsius keeps beating analyst expectations and growing revenue at a triple-digit pace, the stock will likely do well again in 2024. It's hard to be bearish when revenue is doubling every year."", ""But smart investors know the long-term story is what matters. Buyers of Celsius stock need to evaluate the business looking out at least three to five years. The stock's current market capitalization of $13.9 billion gives it a price-to-sales multiple of 12.3. That premium valuation might immediately scare some investors away, but this is a company that's likely to double or triple its revenue over the next couple of years while expanding its margins as well. That explains why it's forward-looking valuation metrics are much more reasonable with shares trading at 40 times earnings and 6 times sales."", ""Of course, Celsius isn't guaranteed to keep growing at its current pace, but the company only seems to be building momentum thanks to its growing reach in the strong market for energy drinks."", ""It's hard to predict whether Celsius stock will crush the market again in 2024, but I expect it to be a winning stock over the next five years and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Celsius wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) examine the increasing influence of the Fifth Estate on public discourse. Encompassing a vast and diverse range of independent commentators, social media users, content creators, and online communities, the Fifth Estate poses unprecedented challenges and opportunities for established institutions by empowering individuals and citizen-led movements to drive change.', '""The Fifth Estate has become a significant societal force that can be leveraged for good or ill,"" commented Dr. Moira Gilchrist, Chief Communications Officer, Philip Morris International. ""On the one hand, the digital technologies that underpin it enable everyday people to stand up for what matters to them and help drive broad societal action. On the other, this new power center can favor emotion and ideology over facts, perpetuating polarization and misinformation. The question facing businesses, regulators, and society at large concerns how we can help steer this emerging force in a positive direction and address the valid concerns being expressed.""', 'Most people already interact with and rely on content generated by the Fifth Estate. According to the international survey conducted for PMI by independent research firm Povaddo—the results of which are presented in the paper, ""Rethink Disruption: The Rise of the Fifth Estate""—two-thirds (67 percent) of respondents get news and information from nonmainstream sources.', 'These sources, the survey shows, impact people’s daily lives. When asked whether they had taken any action based on information or recommendations from Fifth Estate sources, respondents said they ""talked to friends or family about something I read"" (90 percent), ""made an online purchase"" (84 percent), ""browsed a company’s website"" (84 percent), and/or ""made an in-store / in-person purchase"" (79 percent). Notably, 69 percent reported that they had changed their views about a particular issue based on the information to which they were exposed.', 'Despite its growing prevalence, the Fifth Estate elicits concerns. Survey respondents stated that individuals and nonmainstream media pose a significant risk in terms of spreading misinformation (59 percent), sharing opinions without evidence (53 percent), and lacking transparency on sourcing (50 percent). Many respondents also highlighted its divisive potential, noting significant risks in terms of enabling the spread of radical ideologies (47 percent), exacerbating societal divisions (44 percent), and fueling cancel culture (40 percent).', '""For PMI, embracing the voices of individuals—most vitally, adult smokers—and encouraging a people-centric debate involving policymakers, public health authorities, and civil society is critical to achieving our ambition of a smoke-free future—a future in which cigarettes have been made obsolete,"" said Dr. Gilchrist. ""The Fifth Estate can accelerate this future by prioritizing accuracy and science-based facts to empower those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to change to better alternatives.""', 'As shown in the international survey, most people want governments, regulators, and platform owners to support positive change online by improving law enforcement’s ability to investigate and hold to account those who misuse internet platforms, implementing initiatives to improve transparency, and combating the generation and spread of misinformation. Individuals, too, have a role to play by verifying authenticity before sharing content, insisting on sources that fact-check information, and seeking out a variety of opinions to inform their views.', 'Read PMI’s latest white paper here.', 'About the survey', 'Povaddo conducted the online survey on behalf of PMI between December 6 and 13, 2023. The survey was fielded among 6,048 general population adults aged 21 and older in six countries: Brazil, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Approximately 1,000 interviews were administered in each country. Data were collected in a balanced way to reflect national population statistics and were not weighted. Results are accurate to a margin of error of ±1 percent at the overall level.', 'Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future', 'Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match–a leader in oral nicotine delivery–creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as modified risk tobacco products. As of September 30, 2023, PMI’s smoke-free products were available for sale in 82 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.7 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 36.2 percent of PMI’s total third-quarter 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference."", 'David Solomon', ""Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was a dynamic year. The U.S. economy proved to be more resilient than expected despite a number of headwinds to growth, including a significant tightening of financial conditions, regional bank failures and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, this was a year of execution for Goldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our strategic focus, we further strengthened our core businesses. As we enter 2024, the potential for rate cuts in the first half of this year has renewed optimism for a soft landing. We are already seeing signs of potential resurgence in strategic activity, which is reflected in our backlog. I'm starting today's presentation with a strategic update and Denis will provide comments on the financial results. Beginning on Page 1. We aspire to be the world's most exceptional financial institution, united by our shared value client service, partnership, integrity and excellence. And over the last 155 years, we have created one of the most aspirational brands and financial services. Goldman Sachs is the preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management. We've continued to simplify our strategy today as an opportunity to take stock of our progress as well as highlight avenues for further growth. Strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence to further strengthen our client franchise. As we show on Page 2, we have two world-class and interconnected franchises that are well positioned to achieve these strategic objectives. First, Global Banking & Markets, which includes our top rank investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and our leading capital markets business. It also includes our #1 equities franchise and top 3 FICC franchise, we are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products. And second, our unified Asset & Wealth Management business, where we are a leading global active asset manager with a top 5 alternatives business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise. This is a scaled business with over $2.8 trillion in assets under supervision, and where we see significant opportunity for further growth. Across these two businesses, our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. On Page 3, we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent Investor Day in February 2023. Global Banking & Markets, we've maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking. In FICC & Equities, we have improved our standing with the top 150 clients. We generated record total financing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last 4 years. In Asset & Wealth Management, we've driven solid investment performance and consistent growth and a more durable revenue base of management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues. This past year, we reduced our historical principal investments by $13 billion and also surpassed our 5-year alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule. I will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment. Before I do, I would like to speak about how we've narrowed our strategic focus. We made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them. We exited the market's lending business and sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We sold our Personal Financial Management business. We announced the sale of GreenSky, which remains on track to close this quarter. We also sold the majority of our GreenSky loan portfolio, which settled in the fourth quarter. We've also reached an agreement with General Motors regarding the process to transition the credit card program to another issuer. We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements in our consumer activities. I firmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth, but it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed. Our consumer ambitions have produced over $150 billion of deposits, which we expect to go further from here. These deposits have materially improved the firm's funding profile. Now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win. We recognize that scale matters as it allows us -- it allows the firm to operate more efficiently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs, making unit economics more favorable and we need to be measured and focused on our execution. Our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position, scale and exceptional talent. On Page 4, in Global Banking & Markets, our leading and diversified franchise, has produced average revenues of $32 billion over the last 4 years across a number of different market environments, demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate. In the last several years, we made a concerted effort to grow our wallet share and financing revenues, which have clearly raised the revenue floor for these businesses. We have also generated attractive returns with an average ROE fully allocated of over 16% over the last 4 years. Turning to Page 5, a key part of enhancing the durability has been executing on our strategic priorities. Our efforts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly 350 basis points since 2019. We've maintained our league table ranking of #1 in announced and completed M&A, #1 in equity and equity-related underwriting, #2 in high-yield debt. In FICC & Equities, we're in the top 3 with 117 of our top 150 clients. These competitive positions are a reflection of our One Goldman Sachs approach and our clients' confidence in us. In addition, we have significantly increased more durable financing revenues. FICC & Equities financing together have grown at a 15% CAGR since 2019 to a new record of nearly $8 billion. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 6. We continue to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees in private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019. We have also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pretax margin target on an adjusted basis. Turning to Page 7. Our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inflows. Over 75% of our traditional funds performed in the top half of Morningstar funds while on Alternatives over 90% of our funds were in the top half of Cambridge funds, both over the last 5 years. The fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows across our platform. I want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over $250 billion in Alternatives since 2019, surpassing our $225 billion target a year early. This fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation in developing new strategy as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and long-standing track record. Fundraising has been broad-based across geographies and asset classes with approximately 40% coming from our ultra-high net worth relationships. Very proud of this achievement. When we were preparing for our first Investor Day 4 years ago, I remember how big a reach our initial target of 150 billion seats. We surpassed not only that target, but also our increased target of $225 billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business. Putting all this together on Page 8, you can see how much we've improved the durability of revenues across the firm. On this slide, baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represent the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical, namely advisory, underwriting and intermediation. We believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In fact, in all of the years since we became a public company, it has never happened. In dark blue, you can see the more durable revenues from financing management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, which in aggregate have grown at 13% CAGR since 2019. Taken together, these two components make up over 70% of revenues in 2023. On top of that, we consistently generate upside across different market environments because of our diversified franchise. The increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams, coupled with the diversification of our scaled franchise and our ability to capture upside, demonstrate the revenue generating power of our firm. Narrowing our strategic focus, our leadership team spent a significant amount of time in 2023 realigning the firm's priorities with our strategic vision, our values and our strengths, which we highlighted on Page 9. You've heard us talk about many of these elements before, starting with our strategic objectives. First, the harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; second, to run world-class differentiated and durable businesses; third, to invest and operate at scale. As you can see on the page, our execution focus areas for 2024 are aligned with these strategic objectives. Taking one example, investing in our people and culture, exceptional quality of our people, supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problem, and it's imperative that we continue to invest in them. All in these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes. We continue to be a trusted adviser to our clients, to be an employer of choice for our people and to generate mid-teens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return. With everything we achieved in 2023, coupled with our clear and simplified strategy, we have a much stronger platform for 2024. I feel very confident about the future of Goldman Sachs, our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results."", 'Denis P. Coleman', ""Thank you, David. Good morning. Let me start on Page 10 of the presentation. In 2023, we generated net revenues of $46.3 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion and earnings per share of $22.87. As David highlighted, we made significant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions as well as the impact of the FDIC special assessment fees on the slide. In aggregate, these items reduced full year net earnings by $2.8 billion, earnings per share by $8.04 and our ROE by 2.6 percentage points. Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 12. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $30 billion for the year, down 8% as higher equities revenues were more than offset by a decline in FICC revenues and investment banking fees versus last year. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees of $1.7 billion fell 12% year-over-year, driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in 2022. For 2023, we maintained our #1 league table position in announced and completed M&A as well as in equity and equity-related underwriting and ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting. Our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, driven by a significant increase in advisory. As David mentioned, we are encouraged by the robust level of dialogues with our corporate client base. And though we're only two weeks into the new year, there have been solid levels of capital markets activity in both the U.S. and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2 billion in the quarter, down 24% from strong performance last year amid lower activity in rates and other macro products. In FICC financing, revenues rose to a record $739 million. Equities net revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-on-year. The year-over-year increase in intermediation revenues was driven by better results in derivatives. Financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose year-over-year with continued strength on higher average balances. Across FICC & Equities, financing revenues rose 10% in 2023, consistent with our priority to grow client financing. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 14. For 2023, revenues of $13.9 billion rose 4% year-over-year as an increase in more durable revenues, including record management and other fees and record private banking and lending revenues offset a decline in equity investment revenues and incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.4 billion were up 9% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $9.5 billion, putting us on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024, notwithstanding the sale of our PFM business. Equity investments produced net revenues of $838 million, higher year-over-year driven by modest gains in our public portfolio versus losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Results in this line item also included a gain of $349 million from the sale of PFM. Moving on to Page 15. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and alternative assets, and representing our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. Turning to Page 16 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $295 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $571 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, surpassing our $2 billion target for 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $32 billion for the quarter and $72 billion for the year. As David mentioned, third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day now stands at over $250 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $46 billion, of which roughly $16 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $4 billion, including sales of $3 billion of CIEs across over 40 positions, bringing reductions for the year to $13 billion. We continue to focus on exiting this portfolio over the medium term, though we don't expect portfolio reductions in 2024 to be at the same pace as in 2023. I'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 17. Full year revenues were $2.4 billion, up 58% versus 2022. Quarterly net revenues of $577 million were up 12% year-over-year on higher consumer platform results amid growth in average credit card balances. As David mentioned, we reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer, the impact of which was to move the loans to held for sale and release the associated loan loss reserves of approximately $160 million. We have no additional updates regarding our credit card partnerships at this time. On Page 18, Firmwide net interest income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter was down 13% relative to the third quarter, reflecting an increase in funding costs supporting trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $183 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting an increase in other collateralized lending, which includes the pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities we won an auction in October. Our provision for credit losses was $577 million. In relation to our consumer portfolio, provisions were driven by net charge-offs and seasonal balance growth, partially offset by the GM reserve release I mentioned. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments that were generally in line with the last two quarters with roughly half related to CRE. Let's turn to expenses on Page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $34.5 billion. Excluding severance-related costs of $310 million, compensation expense was flat year-over-year, amidst solid core performance and as the market for talent remains competitive. As of the fourth quarter, we achieved our goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies, which allowed us to continue investing in our talent. Quarterly noncompensation expenses were $4.9 billion, and included CIE impairments of $262 million. The year-over-year increase in non-comp expenses was driven by the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was 20.7%. For 2024, we expect a tax rate of 22% to 23%. Turning to capital on Slide 21. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.5% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, 150 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion at an average price of $311 and common stock dividends of $922 million. While we expect to remain nimble with respect to capital return, given the ongoing uncertainty around the Basel reproposed rule, our capital management philosophy is unchanged. We prioritize supporting client deployment opportunities, sustainably growing our dividend, and returning excess to shareholders in the form of buybacks, particularly when valuation levels are attractive. In conclusion, we made solid progress on narrowing our strategic focus in 2023 with our execution driving a much stronger platform for 2024. Our best-in-class core businesses are well positioned to execute on our strategic objectives. We will continue to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence, run world-class differentiated and durable businesses and invest to operate our businesses at scale. Additionally, the execution focus areas we've identified for 2024 will help us drive the outcomes of delivering for clients, our people and our shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""So I wanted to get a mark-to-market, you've been rightfully cautious, but optimistic on green shoots becoming reality in investment banking. You definitely saw some momentum in the fourth quarter. So curious -- and you mentioned that the pipeline is up quarter-on-quarter, so maybe just differentiate between what you're seeing on the corporate side versus sponsor side and just get the mark-to-market on how you're feeling."", 'David Solomon', ""Sure. Sure, Glenn. I mean just at a base level, I'm pretty optimistic given the way we've got the firm position, and there's no question that these capital markets and M&A activity levels have been depressed. As I've said before, I don't think that continues year on year on year, and we really started to see in the second half of this year, real improvement. As Denis highlighted, the M&A backlog saw a really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter. And I just highlight, and I know this is obvious, but I think it's worth stating, we put up $1 billion of M&A revenue. If the backlog is growing, that means we've got to replace the $1 billion that we put up plus then have growth. And so that's a very, very strong replenishment. And I would just say the level of strategic dialogue has definitely increased, and we're seeing it across our platform. I'm encouraged by capital markets activity. I'm not going to say it's running back to 10-year averages right away, but it has materially improved. I do think you're going to see some more meaningful IPOs in 2024, and we are just across debt and equity issue and see more activity, more engagement. At the end of the day, people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time, but they've got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market, and we're seeing that come through. So when I look broadly, it feels better. There's a lot going on in the world. And so I think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry 98% of the time, about the 2% of things that can go wrong. So we're going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the firm. But I do think the firm is incredibly well levered to this pickup and it feels better, is the way I'd frame it."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', 'All right, cool. Maybe just a follow-up on that note. Reducing the on-balance sheet investments, as you mentioned, is an important part of the ROE improvement for us in wealth and for Goldman overall. So with that said, the markets are higher, pipelines better, how come the balance sheet reduction of on-balance sheet investments might be slower this year, when the intent, I think, is to get rid of all of it at the right price?', 'David Solomon', ""Yes. I -- first of all, I think we've made a lot of progress last year. And so if you look at what we accomplished, I think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful, especially given the environment. One of the things that happened is we pulled some stuff forward that we didn't expect to monetize in 2023 -- into 2023. And so to be clear, our focus is to get that to 0 as quickly as possible. If you're operating inside this firm and you're operating in that business, you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible, but we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately. We set a clear target over the next 3 years to get to 0. My guess is we've got a good shot if we executed doing that quicker than that."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""I just wanted to spend some time on the FICC business. So if I'm looking at the right numbers, it feels like FICC revenues are now back to pre-COVID levels if you go back to 1Q of '19. Maybe if you can unpack it, just looking at Slide 13, it seems like most products were quite weak. Give us some perspective around -- does both the intermediation piece of FICC, does that feel like we are close to trough and unlike seasonality, we should see some improvement in FICC from here? If you can just provide some perspective there."", 'David Solomon', ""Sure. I mean at a high level, what I would say this quarter, intermediation activity was quiet and particularly in the back half of the quarter, kind of late November and December, clients are quiet. If you look at the whole year, I don't think it's fair -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't think it's fair to say the whole year is back to '19 levels. The overall activity levels were up and down during the year. We have a big diversified business. When our clients are active, we execute on it. We continue to grow the financing revenues, which make it overall more durable, but it was a quiet quarter, particularly the back half in terms of intermediation. I don't expect it to continue at that pace. I think Denis' comments in the opening, we're seeing more activity in the first few weeks of the year. But we'll watch it. And as you know, that activity, particularly in that segment can move up and down based on what's going on in the macro environment."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""Got it. Maybe just sticking to FICC or maybe both FICC & Equities. On the financing side, if you don't mind reminding us of the opportunity to grow financing over the next year or over the medium term?"", 'Denis P. Coleman', ""So thanks, Ebrahim. So we've been clear over the last several years that we see opportunities to grow both FICC & Equities financing, and it's a virtuous activity for us. It dovetails well with our focus on clients and our focus on market share. We have a lot of expertise in this space and we see a lot of demand from clients for us to deploy both into FICC & Equities. We now have leading equities franchise overall. Our equities financing business is in a leadership position and at scale. It has grown significantly, and we continue to see opportunities to increase the activities that we do with our existing clients and bring new clients onto the platform. So we look out into 2024 and 2025. We continue to be very focused. I think there's good opportunities across both FICC & Equities financing in GBM."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Mr. Hawken?"", 'Brennan Hawken', ""Sorry about that. So just curious about the impact that we should be thinking about around the potential exit from the Apple relationship. I know it's an ongoing thing, but maybe is there anything that you could provide that might help us think about how that impact could flow through?"", 'David Solomon', ""Denis said in his comments, we've got no other updates on the credit card partnerships other than what he stated. We continue to work with Apple on a partnership with them to serve our customers and to continue to reduce the drag from the partnership, and we continue to make good progress. And the drag in 2024 will be materially less."", 'Brennan Hawken', ""Okay. Appreciate that. And then when you think about the deposit platform, Marcus, that's been a pretty bright spot on the consumer front and definitely seems to have worked well. What has been your views? Or how has the beta on that deposit base played out versus your expectations? And do you have any plans to adjust your thoughts around, earlier you talked about wanting to be in the top decile of payouts for that product. Is that still the goal? Or has that adjusted as the platform has matured?"", 'Denis P. Coleman', ""Sure, Brennan. Thank you for that question. Our Marcus deposit platform has been a real strategic advantage to us in terms of overall firm-wide funding. We did set out a strategy to set our pricing at the higher end of the pricing envelope to maintain, sustain and grow our balances across that platform. We haven't adjusted our strategy at this point. We saw good growth across our various strategic deposit funding channels last year, not just Marcus. Overall, deposits were up over $40 billion on the year. And I would just say, as we move into 2024, we continue to focus on driving growth across the strategic channels and be thoughtful about our overall funding mix."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""David, you started off the call saying that 2023 was the year of execution. And that's a year when you had an ROE of 8%, and if we throw in some of the charges, it's 10%, and that's not really executing at your 15% or so desired return. So can you give us a kind of waterfall chart in words on how you get from that core 10% ROE to 15%? And if you could define medium term?"", 'David Solomon', ""Sure. So I appreciate the question, Mike. And obviously, we're very focused on it. It wasn't an A environment for our core business. In fact, I don't even think it was B environment when investment banking is operating at low levels that is an impact overall. I do think that it's important to look at our core business of banking and markets, which is a very significant portion of the firm and do know on a fully allocated basis in this environment, which was not a B+ or an A environment, given the investment banking activity, it had a 12% ROE. We continue to believe through the cycle that, that business is a mid-teens business. And so I don't think we're going to see -- stay at the level of activities that we've been at, and we have that business positioned very well. And so you'll get some upside returns there in a better environment. And then secondarily, on Asset & Wealth Management, we continue to reduce the balance sheet. The balance sheet has been a drag on returns, but I think we've been pretty clear that we can drive the Asset & Wealth Management with a smaller balance sheet to mid-teens returns are better with a 25% margin. We're on that journey. We're making progress. I think we'll make very good progress over the next 2 years. And if you look at those two businesses, that's the vast, vast majority of the firm, and I think they can operate mid-teens. We've significantly reduced the other drags. We got a lot of it behind us in this year. That doesn't mean there won't be anything, but the drag from platforms in 2024 will be materially reduced from what it's been. And so I think we're making good progress in the medium terms over the next couple of years, provided that it's a reasonable environment. And so I think you'll see good progress on the overall positioning of the firm over the next 3 to 5 years."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', 'And then just to follow up. The other drag you said would be a lot less than 2024 from Platform Solutions, and can you dimension that a little bit? And also as it relates to principal investments, do the higher stock markets help the disposition or not so much?', 'David Solomon', ""They absolutely do. I mean when markets improve, they help the disposition. There's no question. I also -- when you look at the last 2 years, we've had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that, but on a much smaller balance sheet in 2024. With a better market, you actually might have some benefit to revenue performance. But we're focused on reducing that broadly. You see, you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on GreenSky, move GM to held for sale. And so you have more transparency on that. We think the drag will be significantly reduced in 2024. When we're comfortable providing more specific color on that, we will provide it. But small in the overall context of the firm and the firm's performance."", 'Operator', ""We'll go back to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities."", 'Devin Patrick Ryan', ""David and Denis, a question just on kind of interplay between a recovery in investment banking versus trading intermediation. And I know there's probably a lot of assumptions that need to go in here. But if you think about kind of the environment with macro conditions settling down, which would likely support investment banking, I'm assuming some areas of trading could also slow down. And then maybe other areas could pick up as well. So just love to maybe hear a little bit about kind of the puts and takes, kind of what you've seen historically there, easier? And just really kind of the key question is just whether you can grow investment banking revenues and trading ex financing at the same time?"", 'David Solomon', ""Yes. So at a high level, Devin, I appreciate the question. I think we can continue to grow our financing activity given the scale and the size of the market, the way market activity is growing. And we will normalize investment banking activity. And obviously, over time, given our position, and if you assume growth in the world, growth in market cap of the world, we will continue, as we have for the last 25, 35 years, grow our investment banking activity. When there's real disruption in the world, we find that FICC can be a little bit countercyclical in some way, shape or form. But that's not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation on market activity. I think there's a lot going on in the world, the trajectory of rates. There's a point of view on rates and inflation, but it's certainly not certain to me. I think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment. There's debates about how the Fed continues on its quantitative tightening or it doesn't continue on its quantitative tightening. And so all of this, I think, will continue to play into people being active in markets. So I do think just at a high level, look, this is a high level. I think the environment in 2024 feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in 2023. But I'm not a good predictor and we're prepared to operate in whatever environment we have to operate in."", 'Devin Patrick Ryan', 'Understood. I appreciate that, David. Maybe a quick follow-up for Denis. Just commercial real estate, clearly a big headwind in 2023, I appreciate all the disclosure, their office on balance sheet to only $1 billion now. So when you think about just the environment relative to current marks, how do you feel about kind of the pain being behind the company and just characterize the environment where maybe there still could be material marks? And then just more broadly, kind of expectations for marks as you exit the historical CRE on balance sheet principal investments?', 'Denis P. Coleman', ""Sure, Devin. Thank you. And as you know, we have a new disclosure the last couple of quarters on CRE, in particular, on the nature of the loans in that sector and then as well as the on balance sheet, both CRE and office. In particular, you can obviously see from those disclosures we've made substantial progress moving down the positions over the course of 2023, gave disclosure on the number of CIE positions that we moved down recently, and we've made really significant progress. We disclosed on prior calls and then our office exposures from an impairment and marks perspective, we're sitting at roughly 50%. So we think that based on the visibility that we had and the activity that we had over the course of 2023 that, that portfolio and the broader portfolio for that matter, sits at the right place. As we move into 2024, there should be opportunities for further dispositions and will remain very focused on what the mix of that disposition activity is. When David was reviewing our expectations with respect to HPI sell-down on the forward, in addition to moving towards our medium-term target. We're also mindful of what the long-term franchise impact of those sell-down activities are. So just to give you a sense for why we may have cautioned on pace. We have some meaningful credit exposures where we enjoy a position of incumbency. And for the long-term benefit of the franchise, we very much hope that we will remain as a lender and a supporter of those clients. To exit those positions in advance of a potential refinancing would be to surrender our incumbency position. And so we're being thoughtful so that we can continue to reduce our risk while continuing to grow the third-party fund management business while supporting clients in the process."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley."", 'Ryan Michael Kenny', 'So you highlighted in the prepared remarks that Goldman surpassed your fundraising target and alternatives. And so as we look forward, can you give some more color on your strategy to grow particularly in private credit? Any update on how big you expect to get in private credit, how it complements your DCM and wealth franchises and maybe any risks that we should be thinking about would be helpful.', 'David Solomon', ""Sure. I appreciate the question. It's obviously something Ryan, we're very, very focused on. We feel good about the fundraising progress we've made. I think when you look forward in 2024, you could expect us to raise another $40 billion to $50 billion of alternatives. We're obviously very focused on private credit. We do operate at scale in private credit. We have over $110 billion of private credit. But I think the opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale in private credit, especially given the way our franchise is positioned and the origination connection we have with our broad banking business gives us a unique platform and a unique competitive advantage. So we're going to continue to keep this focus. It doesn't stop because we met our goal. Our goal was meant to frame the opportunity set 3.5 years ago, but you'll see us continue to raise money on a year-to-year basis, and we've got some big funds that we're going to be in the market within 2024, and we'll continue to build the partnerships with that client base and both myself, John Waldron and the broad team across our Asset Management division are spending a lot of time with the big capital allocators all over the world and continuing to invest in those relationships."", 'Ryan Michael Kenny', 'And then Basel Endgame comment letters are due today. So now that you and other G-SIBs have had time to digest the proposal, could you give us an update on how Goldman might plan to adapt if potential final rule comes through and how the proposal as written might impact your 15% to 17% through the cycle ROTCE target?', 'David Solomon', ""Sure. Well, obviously, today marks the end of the comment period and what I would say, it's certainly not the end of the process. In fact, I would say it's the end of the beginning of the process. And so we're moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders, given our significant concern with the proposed rules. You'll see comment letters from us, from our peers. You'll also see many letters from end users, including pension funds, insurance companies, corporates, who are particularly concerned about how this rule could affect their access the capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risk in their business. And I think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry, and also, I think, disadvantages the U.S. from a competitive perspective. So to be clear, my view is the rule is not proposed appropriately, and it should be withdrawn and reproposed. I don't think speculating on the impact of the rule, as proposed, I think there's a pretty significant view out there that the Fed is listening carefully. They're taking in the feedback and I don't think there is anyone that's looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed. We're very flexible with our capital, as I've said before. If the rules put certain changes in place, we'll also adjust businesses or pricing of businesses and certain activity to adapt. I think to speculate as to how we'll talk about this once it's in place before we have any idea what the world is going to look like is premature. But we've got a lot of capital flexibility, and we've proven over time, we can be particularly nimble. And so we'll continue to focus."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies."", 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', ""As you think about your efficiency targets, what's a reasonable level of growth for noncomp expense as we -- excluding obviously all the one-timers this year and maybe what the areas of investment are -- priorities when you think about 2024?"", 'Denis P. Coleman', ""Thanks, Dan. So the efficiency ratio is something we are laser-focused on. We continue to orient the firm to drive towards our 60% target. You mentioned the impact of selected items. I mean, if you take the impact over the course of 2023, the efficiency ratio would have been more like 65%. That's obviously not where we want it to be, but significantly better than the fully reported number. We have a number of initiatives across the firm to get after our noncompensation expense. We had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efficiency targets at the end of last year, rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year. There's a -- we have a ton of different categories. We're in the process of reviewing each and every category of our noncompensation expense, benchmarking it, reviewing KPIs, thinking about our processes, incentive structures, governance, things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efficiently as possible. We do see an impact of inflation across these activities. And it's for that reason that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible. I think as we look into 2024, if you take a look at the disclosure around selected items, we don't expect those types of activities to repeat and we'll be very, very -- remain very, very focused on maintaining our overall noncomp expense spend. And the other component of the efficiency ratio is obviously compensation expense. And you saw that over the course of this year. We maintained our pay-for-performance orientation with respect to how we size that, and you should expect the same on the forward into 2024. That is obviously a performance-based and variable component of our overall expense. There are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable. Our largest items, both compensation as well as transaction expenses are variable. So we will have to see how the types of activities unfold into 2024 and what the mix of our activities are to ultimately determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efficiency ratio."", 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', ""Great. And follow-up on Wealth Management. You disclosed 40% of the alternative inflows since 2019 have come from the Wealth channel. Just curious if that was consistent throughout that time period and whether you view that level of contribution as sustainable. And also just the economics to Goldman Sachs, how it differs between that 40% in Wealth and the 60% externally, how does that -- what's the difference in revenues?"", 'David Solomon', ""Well, at a high level, that comment is -- looks over the past 4 years that we've grown our Asset Management business, Asset & Wealth Management business, and it highlights the alternative raising over that period, this initial period of investment, what the mix has been between wealth, the institutional client base or other channels like third-party wealth, retail, et cetera. When you look at our strategy, Dan, we -- if you go back 20 years, most of our fundraising for these activities came from our Private Wealth channel and the percentage of the money we manage was much higher than 40% from Private Wealth. So as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community, the sovereign wealth community areas, where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding, that percentage of Wealth funding will probably decrease, but I'm not going to speculate exactly where it will go. At scale, the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive. They're attractive in the Private Wealth channel and they're attractive in our institutional partnerships. But as I think you all know, they're not exactly identical. And people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate $10 billion, definitely have a different economic proposition than somebody that's giving you $50 million or $100 million. And that's been consistent in the business for a long, long time. So we're continuing to scale the business. We have real margin targets for the business. I think we've got lots of opportunities, and we're still in the early stages of using the platform of Goldman Sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the benefit of our scale Asset & Wealth Management platform, and I'm confident we'll continue to make good progress."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""There's obviously all the uncertainty on the capital as was discussed earlier. But just in the near term, how do you think about top allocation? You're obviously continuing to lean into financing, which is capital intensive, depending on how banking and if banking comes back, banking consume capital. And then just touch on interest in bolt-on deals and then obviously, ending on buybacks which were pretty solid in '23."", 'David Solomon', ""I'll start and Denis can add some comments. We've always said that when there's activity to support our clients, that's our primary focus on where we can allocate capital. We've increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise, our client franchises over the course of the last 5 years. And I think one of the reasons why our big broad Global Banking & Markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in different environments, the way it's performed is we've been very, very focused on making sure we have the capital and the financial resources to serve our client base well. Where we see opportunities, we will continue to deploy capital there, and that's in our broad capital planning program. We do generate a lot of capital from earnings. And to the degree that we don't see opportunities to deploy it with our clients, we will return it to shareholders. At the moment, we're taking a more conservative posture around that, just given some of the uncertainty around Basel III Endgame, although, again, I think that's going to continue to evolve. And I also think we have a long track record of being very, very nimble with our ability to deploy. So we're going to continue to focus on making sure we've got the right resources to serve our clients. And as we generate capital, we have confidence in our capital position, we'll return capital to shareholders. And we've been very focused, as you've seen on growing the dividend, and we plan to continue to do that."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", 'And then just separately, following up on the exit of legacy on balance sheet principal investment, is there an expense reduction opportunity as those investments in some of the infrastructure goes away over time?', 'David Solomon', ""There's an operating leverage story, which is one of the reasons why the margin in our Asset & Wealth Management business will continue to improve. When we were running an on-balance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of on balance sheet position, the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions creates a business that scale differently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone else's alternative platform. And so we're early in the journey, I'll just give a simple example. We went out last year, 1.5 years ago and raised our first growth equity fund. We used to do that business on balance sheet. We have lots and lots of positions and therefore, a very, very broad team to service that. We raised our first fund. We needed smaller team to manage that fund, but when you go and you raise your second fund, you don't need to increase the scale of the team. And so there's real operating leverage, and that's part of our margin improvement story in Asset & Wealth Management over time. So the answer is yes. I don't want to overstate this because it's not a massive part of the story, but it is a place we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund firm."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""David, in your prepared remarks, David, you were talking about -- I think it was Slide 5 or 6, but about the success in growing the relationships with those top 100 FICC & Equities clients, and you identified that the FICC & Equities financing contributed to that success, and that's been a real hallmark for you guys over the last 2 or 3 years, the growth in that business. Can you dig down first and share with us what has attributed to the success? Is it the capital you put into that business, the hiring of additional folks or people in the business and as well as competition? Is the competition been more challenged than some of your competitors, all Credit Suisse, of course, is no longer around. But if you could just give us a little more color on what's driving that success?"", 'David Solomon', ""Sure, Gerard. At a high level, I'd point to a couple of things, but I'd start with the fact that business is a scale business, and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of firms that really does operate those businesses at scale. And I think that's just important to the baseline. But I think there are a handful of things that we've done well. First, One GS and One GS ethos, if you go back historically, we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience and clients would come into the firm in different places and get different experiences. And we spent a lot of time, and this goes back to 2019 really thinking about how do these clients experience the firm, and we went out, we talked to them, we listened to their feedback. They really wanted to deal with the firm as a partner, One partner. I think we've made through One GS and that ethos real progress in dealing with these very large clients in this business in an integrated approach that's improved their experience. And because it's improved their experience, they feel more partner-like with us, and therefore, that's improved our wallet share. Secondarily, we become a much bigger financer of their activities. And when you finance their activities, you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem. And number three, we've also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view, a very long-term approach to transacting with them. They need our help sometimes with things that aren't that economically attractive, we want to be there. If you do that, you do that consistently, you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive. And so I think those three things combined with our scale platform have really helped us when we look at our wallet shares. We continue to spend a lot of time, John and I spend a lot of time and Denis too, talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business, asking for their feedback. And as we take that feedback, we'll continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence. And as you saw from the presentation that we put up, one of the things that we're really focused on is how our One GS operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. It's a big, big tenet of what we're trying to do."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Very good. And then I know you've talked about the pipelines and your comments about what we might be able to see in ECM and other areas this year. Can you also give us a little flavor on what parts of the -- since you're obviously a global force, what parts of the globe are you seeing the best potential? Is it the Americas? Is it Europe? Or is it Asia?"", 'David Solomon', ""Well, it's scale. The Americas is the biggest part of the activity level. And just given the resilience of the U.S. economy, I think you've seen a material pickup there proportionally that's broader than other places. But we are seeing more activity across Europe, particularly strategic dialogue. I'd say the one place where I think is slower obviously is in Asia with respect to China. And just given the nature of economic activity there and where things are positioned, that still seems slower, both the M&A side and the capital market side. But those are comments that make it a high level, Gerard."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', 'Thank you. Always appreciate the insights. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""So I wanted to ask a couple of questions about comp leverage and operating margins. And maybe just to start off, Denis, you noted the adjusted efficiency ratio set at 65% versus the reported figure in the mid-70s. When we try to adjust for various items, at least in the public disclosure, it looks like the core adjusted efficiency somewhere in the upper 60s. And I was hoping you can maybe just help us reconcile some of the different items to get down to that 65% figure and whether that's the appropriate jumping off point that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to '24?"", 'Denis P. Coleman', ""So Steven, I'd say, I think the 65% is a good jumping off point for 2024. And as the business evolves from there, as I indicated on a prior question, we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the firm. Certain of our activities attract different degrees of transaction-based and other expenses as we prosecute those activities. And so we'll have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like. We'll have to be mindful, obviously, what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward in 2024. I think on the compensation side of the equation, you noticed our disclosure, that was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Our revenues net of PCL in the year were up 1%, and our compensation roughly flat. We observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of significant execution activity, and we want to make sure that we're in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into '24 with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see. In terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential, most of those are pretty discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the one-off FDIC special assessment. The one area we'll continue to manage carefully is on CIEs as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as we've discussed."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""That's great. And just for a follow-up relating to the comments you just made, Denis, on comp leverage, specifically. It looks like the expectation is for revenues to grow about $4 billion this year for The Street. The comp dollars are expected to increase only about $600 million. You do have a good track record of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins. But I just wanted to get a sense, given you were alluding to the fact that you're going to pay for talent and you're going to compensate people appropriately that execute well on the platform, how we should be thinking about incremental comp leverage, is an 85% comp margin a realistic expectation given where the revenue growth is ultimately going to come from?"", 'Denis P. Coleman', ""Steven, I'll make a comment. David wants to make another one as well. We're very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform. We're also focused on driving scale across the platform. And meanwhile, we're staying true to our mantra of pay-per-performance. It's what our people expect, and it's one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients. The ultimate compensation payout relative to the results in 2024 really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reflect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention, service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""I was just wondering what you're going to do about the Lead Independent Director, who I guess is no longer on your Board, Bayo, I guess, his firm got purchased and now you need to get a new lead director. Is that someone from the Board currently, someone from outside Goldman Sachs, what type of person is the Board looking for?"", 'David Solomon', ""So I appreciate the question, Mike. As you highlight, at the end of last week, Bayo sold his business to BlackRock. Bayo still is the Lead Director. That deal won't close until sometime in the third or fourth quarter. Bayo is the Lead Director. We have a governance process in place. Our Board has met and at the appropriate time, we'll make announcement as to the transition. But at this point, other than the fact that because of the sale, it will create a transition. I have nothing more to say other than Bayo is still the Lead Director, and we'll manage the transition in an orderly process and no surprises."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', 'Okay. So what? You would consider people outside of Goldman Sachs currently for that or?', 'David Solomon', ""Well, we're always adding people to our Board, Mike. But I'm not going to make comments. I'm not going to make forward comments about our governance process and our Board looks at this at the time that the Board takes action. We announced a clear transition. I'll be happy to answer questions and talk about it."", 'Operator', 'At this time, there are no additional questions in queue.

What we've seen thus far in earnings and it's early is really-- we're going through a bottoming process for the traditional commercial banks. We're seeing net interest income or the top line revenue, that's in the process of bottoming.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion regarding medical malpractice, its cost to the patients and economy, and industry developments, skip to Best Malpractice Lawyers in Each of the 10 Biggest Cities in the US.\xa0', 'Medical malpractice can result in life-threatening consequences for patients. Medical providers take the lives of their patients into their own hands, so they need to be extremely competent. However, if they fail to give the right care, the patient can hold them accountable in a court of law for damages. However, it is often difficult to prove medical malpractice, which is why most people require the services of a lawyer specializing in malpractice. To establish malpractice, certain conditions must be met. ', 'The plaintiff should have a patient relationship with the defending party. The medical professional must have a duty of care towards the patient. In addition, the medical care provider must have breached their duty towards the patient. This will prove that the medical healthcare provider acted unreasonably compared to someone with their training. In addition, one of the most important things for the prosecuting party is to prove that the negligence caused harm to them. It is also essential to prove that the negligence caused damages such as medical bills and income losses. Like all other cases, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution.\xa0', 'One of the most common types of medical malpractice is a misdiagnosis. Sometimes, a doctor would diagnose their patient with the wrong disease, which may result in a substantial physical or financial burden. Delayed diagnosis is also one of the most common types of medical malpractice. It can have devastating effects on the patient, especially in the cases of cancer. Treatment mistakes and incorrect treatment are also quite common medical malpractice that can potentially endanger the lives of the patients. One of the most dangerous forms of medical malpractice is surgical malpractice. Surgeons are highly trained to perform extremely precise and critical tasks. However, sometimes they can make mistakes which can have serious effects on the patients.\xa0', 'Medical malpractice is quite costly to the American economy. According to a study, the average annual cost of the medical liability system is $55.6 billion in 2008 dollars, which is 2.4% of the total healthcare spending in the US. The costs associated with medical malpractice include malpractice attorney law fees, expert witness fees, attorney travel expenses, and other legal expenses. However, it should be noted that in most malpractice cases, attorneys work on a contingency fee, which means that they get paid only if the plaintiff is compensated. Indirect costs such as loss of productivity and income for health care providers also add to the cost of medical malpractice.\xa0', 'According to the National Practitioner Data Bank, the average settlement amount in malpractice cases in 2018 was $358,451. However, the estimates of the average settlement amounts vary source by source. Some attorneys quote an average of $242,000, whereas Storm Law Firm states a figure closer to $400,000. Yet, the average payout for malpractice cases that go to trial is much higher, with some sources quoting a figure close to a million.\xa0', 'Recent advancements have made it easier for attorneys and plaintiffs to find information regarding malpractice and fight their cases. For example, FindLaw is a leading online platform by Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI). It offers legal services and software tools in a variety of areas, including divorce laws and medical malpractice. FindLaw is a legal subsidiary of Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI) which also provides a comprehensive directory of attorneys. In addition, Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI) acquired Casetext in 2023, a cloud-based legal research platform that develops AI-driven tools for legal professionals. The company also recently announced that it will invest $100 million every year for the development of generative AI experiences.\xa0', ""Some insurance companies specialize in providing medical malpractice coverage to their clients. These companies protect their clients against professional liabilities, in case they have claims against them. In the case of medical malpractice, companies such as American International Group. Inc. (NYSE:AIG) provides coverage to the medical practitioners. The company was among the top contributors to some of the popular Hedge Funds, including Diamong Hill Large Cap Strategy. Although American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was not a part of our 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds list, the company's operating results outperformed expectations of most. We have previously discussed in detail why American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) outperformed in 2023 Q2, here. Meanwhile, here is what Diamond Hill's Large Cap Strategy said about the company in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '""Insurance company American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was also among our top contributors. The company’s most recent operating results outperformed expectations, as it reported robust earnings with improving underwriting margins in the property and casualty business. AIG’s strategic initiatives also added to the positive sentiment. The company made further progress in separating its Life & Retirement unit by selling additional shares via a secondary offering. Furthermore, AIG announced the sale of its reinsurance business to RenaissanceRe at an attractive valuation, a move that will further reduce volatility in AIG’s continuing operations.""', ""With that backdrop, let's look at the best malpractice lawyers in each of the 30 biggest cities in the US.\xa0"", 'Galyna Motizova/Shutterstock.com', 'For our list of Best Malpractice Lawyers in Each of the 30 Biggest Cities in the US, we first picked out the 30 largest US cities by population.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analyst David Meier. David, how are you today?"", ""David Meier: I'm doing very well. How are you?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Good, we've got sun, I'm happy about it. Wanted to talk to you this week about job cuts because this year has kicked off with a lot of cuts, and I'm surprised by it. But we've got Amazon, Unity Software, BlackRock, Rent the Runway, Google, even Xerox. Last year to me felt like the year of the big layoff. This year maybe the small layoff, but what's happening here?"", ""David Meier: Time will tell if we're going to find out if this is a new round of bigger layoffs or if this is just, sort of ones companies didn't get to in 2023. Because if we go back and think about what was being communicated in 2023, a lot of the growth in tech companies slowed, and the push for profits and cash flow increased. So that leads me to believe that, hey, if there's any, now's the time when companies are finalizing their budgets and getting ready for the next year, so if the companies are rationalizing their growth plans, where investment dollars are being cut, unfortunately, there's a good chance labor dollars have to get cut with it. That's the idea of matching your potential revenue with the potential expenses. We'll see what happens. But obviously, a lot of announcements to start the year."", ""Deidre Woollard: The question I'm asking myself, is it iterative? Is it incremental? Are we honing our focus here? It's hard to know. The other thing I'm juxtaposing that with is the macro. I chatted recently with Liz Ann Sonders from Schwab. We're going to have her on our Saturday's show. She said that some companies might be hoarding labor, so there's this conflicting data between the macro. Job numbers are still strong, but we're also seeing all of these little layoffs, so how do we balance all of that?"", ""David Meier: That is an excellent point you've made and an excellent question. As a bottom-up investor, what I'm trying to stay focused on is what the companies are saying and doing more so than the higher-level data. That's because, first and foremost, what I'm trying to figure out is if a stock is attractive or not, and that starts with company data. But as you so rightly pointed out, we have to pay more attention to the macro data. Because what that does is it helps us understand the type of investing environment that we're in. To your point, right now the data from a company level versus the higher level data seems to be a little bit conflicting. Unemployment is still very low, and that's even as interest rates have been rising. Right now with overall good employment, we have wages that have gone up, we have the rate of inflation falling, that seems to be good for the economy and should be good for stocks. However, we need to evaluate what's happening at a company level in order to figure out if the particular stock we're interested is attractive or not."", ""Deidre Woollard: That's such a good point because some of the companies I mentioned, there's a big difference between an Alphabet versus your Rent the Runway because they are just very different types of companies."", 'David Meier: Hundred percent.', ""Deidre Woollard: All of that really is interesting when you think about this because you've got the overall macro and then you've got the underneath of like, OK, there's a lot of layoffs, and then you've got the layer deeper and you talked about being a bottom-up investor. It's always conflicting for me because as an individual, I hate layoffs. I was a victim of one, way back when I worked at AOL, and there were a few more before me and it was painful. But as an investor, I have to look at this, and sometimes I see the stock go up, and I have to think about this from a more impersonal standpoint. What questions are you asking yourself?"", ""David Meier: I have fortunately not been in a layoff, although I have seen them happen around me at some companies that I used to work for so I can completely empathize with what you're saying. But as an analyst, the main thing that I want to know is, is this decision consistent with what management's outlook going forward is? Or if it's inconsistent, is what we're seeing a sign of potential problems ahead? As an outsider, as an outside investor looking at the company's data, I'm not privy to the internal conversations that happen about these things. They can be made for a variety of different reasons, but it's important for me to think about the decision relative to the strategy and the tactics that the company is communicating. Again, it's about consistency, like, tell me, does the decision that you're making make sense with where your business is headed?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, that's such a good point too, because I look at the press releases. I used to work in PR, so I understand PR speak a bit. But, you know what? I look at this with BlackRock. They were talking about we're doing these layoffs, but that's because we see more money going toward ETFs. We look at Amazon and Google and they each have a reason that is interesting. With Google, they're laying off some of the people around the Google Assistant, but they're also putting more energy into it. With Amazon, you've got cuts in Twitch, you've got cuts in Prime Video, MGM Studios, maybe that's indicating cost of content. These are small, little, niggly moves in these massive behemoths. But what, are they also signals not just about the job cuts, like hey, we need to balance the budget, but also, hey, we're going in a different direction, and that's why this is necessary?"", ""David Meier: So we're bringing in another variable here."", 'Deidre Woollard: Exactly, yeah.', ""David Meier: That's what you're telling me. But again, your point is spot on, and again, I'll go back to the consistency question. Let's use Google's announcement as the example to walk through here. There may be costs and benefits of the work that needs to go into maintaining and improving Google Assistant at this point in its life cycle, but you could argue that that technology is probably matured, and if it's matured enough, it may need a different amount of labor to do the maintenance and incremental innovation that's required to keep it going. One thing could be, hey, I don't need as much direct labor making these big leaps and bounds in terms of technological innovations, maybe I need less labor and more AI in order to have a better control of my costs that keep that service up and running and interesting for the people who are using it on their phones."", ""Deidre Woollard: It makes me start to wonder, we don't know if these are AI-related parts."", 'David Meier: Correct.', ""Deidre Woollard: And everyone's looking for that, so it's tricky where we're at right now in the cycle."", ""David Meier: But I think that point is, again, spot on. These are the types of things that I think people don't necessarily appreciate in terms of what AI can do. It's not just, hey, I'm going to revolutionize the way we do business. It's also if I can assign AI to do tasks and be more efficient at tasks that I need done, companies are going to do that. That's one way you get a scale advantage in your labor, unfortunately, is to reduce the labor and get more output as a result of that labor using technology."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, and then you have to balance also the optics of this coming back to the PR. Google announced this and immediately there was a tweet from the Alphabet Workers Union saying, these small cuts, they're unnecessary for a company of this size, and then you had another story that was like an almost job cut from Salesforce. Fortune had this story of Salesforce might be freezing hiring, and so then Salesforce had to come out and say that they're strategically hiring, which is interesting because CEO, Marc Benioff of Salesforce, big job cuts last year. Then their last earnings call, he seemed to be throwing open the door saying AI is making us boom, we're hiring. How do you like to see companies handle some of these really tricky optics?"", 'David Meier: Be consistent.', ""David Meier: If we look at the context, focus on Salesforce and Marc Benioff here and we look at the context, look, Marc Benioff is a promotional CEO. He loves to grow, he loves to talk about his company. He loves to talk about the culture within Salesforce and there's nothing wrong with that. But, as a mature company, if growth is picking up and your company needs more labor to execute and capture that growth, then you can talk about hiring. There's no problem with that. But if growth is slowing down and your company needs less labor as a result in order to provide a return to shareholders, look, that's not a fun story to tell, and, you know, Marc Benioff doesn't want to tell that story. That's just not who he is as a person, as a CEO, but it's the right one to tell. Again, just be consistent. Try to be rational here and again, for me as an analyst, I'm looking for that consistency. I want to make sure there is a match between what you're saying, what you're doing as a company, and why you're doing it. If there's a mismatch, that leads to more questions."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah. That consistency is so important. I'm going to switch topics a bit because yesterday on the show, Dylan and Jason, they talked about the SEC's approval of Spot Bitcoin, ETF. They were waiting to hear the official announcement because it hadn't come out when they did the show. Now we've got Gary Gensler, of course, head of the SEC, and his statement. There was a phrase that stuck with me that the SEC doesn't really approve or endorse Bitcoin, and they said, investors need to remain cautious. So I read that as the SEC they had to do this. What do you think? What's your take?"", ""David Meier: What's the idea for Bitcoin? Etf got started and got support from the various service providers that were going to, you know, make this happen. It was inevitable the momentum was not going to stop, and it was not going to be a case where, you know, no, we're just not going to do this. What I think the SEC has been trying to do in this code and code negotiation phase before the approval phase is figure out how they can get best organized in order to provide some oversight. Look, the gravitational pull of Bitcoin is very strong, and the opportunity for service providers to make incremental revenue fee that could actually be really big is also strong, so look, it was going to happen sooner rather than later. That's always been my feeling."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, now it's happened. We've got a potential 11 of these coming to market. The frenzy is on. We've got the grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the shares Bitcoin Trust, those were first out of the gate. Early trading went way up. We know people, there's spent up demand here, right? There's going to be this flurry of excitement I think about this like, is it more like like an IPO where I want to watch, maybe wait a year, see how the market, the way the market works on a company, or is it more like, like a gold ETF or something like that? How do you think about the comparison here?"", ""David Meier: This is an excellent question and one I had to think quite a bit about. But I think I lean toward the IPO approach that you just mentioned and think it's best to wait and see how lots of things shake out and especially how the market for Bitcoin actually responds. I mean, yeah, the potential for, you know, how is this all going to work? Because if there is all this potential demand, that wants it, what's going to happen to the Bitcoin? Well, I guess it's not a security yet. The Bitcoin [OVERLAPPING] asset, how it responds. What I'm really looking for is to see just how much institutional demand there is for this ETF because that's who they're targeting. You know, it's difficult for many institutional investors to actually invest in Bitcoin itself, so this provides them a way to do that. To your point, between this one being approved and 11 more right behind it. Look, we know there's demand, otherwise I shares wouldn't have been pursuing this product. It just remains to be seen how much there is. I think the key to making any decision about whether or not you want to buy this ETF early on is you have to have some way of handicapping that demand. As well as a way of figuring out what's the potential impact of that demand on the asset itself, Bitcoin."", ""Deidre Woollard: I thought of it like an IPO and then I went back to maybe it's more like gold because with an IPO you have the revenue potential. You have the story emerging. With Bitcoin you've got a price, like there's fewer variables there."", ""David Meier: That's an excellent point. The comparison is not perfect, because we don't have an asset, which is a company. If you go through the IPO process now we have all of the financial statements. We have all of the information that gives us insight into what this company is going to do and how it's going to do it and how it's going to grow, et cetera, we just don't have that with an asset like Bitcoin. But on the other hand, it is all about price. I mean, that's really, it's supply and demand. Supply is for now, held constant, and we know demand is there, so the implication is price go up. It's difficult. But unlike gold, this approach, the wait and see approach is better. Because I think there'll be a lot more volatility in Bitcoin than they're likely be with something a commodity like gold."", 'Deidre Woollard: Yeah, yeah, I think that makes sense. Thanks for breaking this down with me today, David.', 'David Meier: Thank you, Deidre.', ""Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on the show, but it's just a peek at the Motley Fool's investing universe.

We'll also include a link in the show notes for you. One of the most powerful questions that investors can ask doesn't involve any math. Ricky Mulvey caught up with Alicia Alfiere for an introduction to the Snap test and apply it to a few companies."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Alicia, I think this is a Foolish test for a company, but I think it's a powerful question that anyone can and maybe should ask before buying a stock, it's called the snap test. To set the table, can you explain what the question is and how it works?"", ""Alicia Alfiere: Yeah, definitely. The snap test is from David Gardner, and so for fans of the Marvel Universe, it's essentially the Thanos test, which means if you snap your fingers and the company is gone, would people be angry? Would they notice? It's shorthand for figuring out if a company has an incredible moat, or a competitive advantage. Sometimes, again, to help you think structurally about a company, is there competition? Are there adequate substitutes? Can anything be rebuilt with time and effort? Of course. But would the loss of a thing drive the need to rebuild? But I would also caution you and say that it's just a piece of the puzzle for investing."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, it's not one question you can ask and then say move on. But it would be easier if it was that way. I think the obvious company to apply it to would be Snapchat because it's one of those things where you can talk about very necessary companies, where if they shut down, things would go very very awry. But also, with a company like Snapchat, if that was immediately shut down, you would have a lot of upset people who could not communicate with their friends."", ""Alicia Alfiere: You would and perhaps I have a bit of a hot take here because I do think for those who are unfamiliar, the Snapchat app is an app that allows for visual messaging and it is wildly popular. In the third quarter, 406 million global users and over 5 million subscriptions. According to Pew Research Center report, Snapchat was one of the most widely used online platforms for teens. Here's the problem though, I do feel like there are a lot of social media apps and therefore a lot of substitutions. If this company were to be snapped away, would its users miss it? Yes, I think so, but I don't think they would have to really wait long before turning to TikTok, Instagram, maybe even the old school Facebook or Whatsapp."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think they would figure something out. I don't know about Facebook. One of my favorite takes is I don't use Facebook anymore, I'm just on Instagram. It doesn't really work. I was talking to a teenager for this volunteer thing, and he told me that he is on Snapchat and he lets everyone see his location and the reason he does that is because what if you were dying and you needed someone to come save you, so he allows every single person that he's ever met in high school to see his location at all times."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Wow.', ""Ricky Mulvey: The social dynamics with Snapchat, there's a lot of hurt feelings because people can see if their friends are gathering without them, it is terribly unhealthy. Maybe not Snapchat, but how about Netflix? That's something that people have been snapped, especially over last year when Netflix started cracking down on password sharing. A lot of people understood like, I'm a little upset, I'm not getting my Netflix right now."", ""Alicia Alfiere: Netflix is just about everywhere. Streaming content in over 190 countries with content in lots of different genres and languages, 247 million paid subscribers at the end of the third quarter and it's still the only major peer play streaming content provider. It was incredibly disruptive to the old way of watching and distributing content and it did so well that as we know, a lot of companies tried to copy the model. It has an incredible amount of content that continues to resonate with its users. I was reading about a Nielsen study and they looked at the US watching habits for the first 38 weeks of 2023 and Netflix had the most watch original series for 37 of those weeks and the most watched movie for 31 of those weeks. We're talking about something that really resonates with people. It was also found that it was more than all of the other streaming services and platforms in terms of screen time, except for YouTube. But the snap test, so several years ago, when it was mostly just Netflix in the space, the company could easily pass over that hurdle for the snap test. It's a little bit more complicated now, there are plenty of substitutes, Disney+, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and others. But we can argue about whether those are actually adequate substitutes for Netflix. Netflix change the way we consume entertainment, and it's still the largest streaming service out there. I think that this one passes the snap test for now. Though, maybe not in another few years if others can catch up."", ""Ricky Mulvey: When I think of the snap test, I think Snap, Netflix, those are some fun ones, but then there's ones where the world would be seriously damaged if these companies wouldn't exist. For that, my mind goes to a lot of the semiconductor companies, whether it's Taiwan Semiconductor which manufactures the chips, or ASML which manufactures the machines that make the chips. If either of those companies went away, there would be very serious problems for the fragile civilization we live in."", ""Alicia Alfiere: Yeah, no, that's absolutely correct, because we're talking about semiconductors are vital to electronics and to your everyday life and that's not at all being hyperbolic, it's true. We're talking about companies that are important in terms of the supply chain of those electronic goods. Definitely, those would pass the snap test."", ""Ricky Mulvey: You mentioned this earlier where you said, just because you passed the snap test, it doesn't mean that it's an attractive stock for an investor. Let's put that to practice then. What are some companies that you think maybe pass the snap test, the world would go awry, it would be very difficult if these companies didn't exist, but you're not running out to buy those stocks?"", ""Alicia Alfiere: Well, everything in context. It depends on individual companies. But I would say that the sector where this would be the case would be the utility company sector. We know if the electrical grid in your area were to disappear, that would be a massive problem. But that doesn't mean you would want to invest in a company. As with everything, it depends on the individual company and circumstances, but these companies often have a fair amount of debt so the utility industry is one of the most leveraged and that's because it has this requirement to maintain and build infrastructure. A lot of these companies pay a dividend, but if a company is taking on too much debt and burning cash, it can put their ability to pay dividends at risk. If that's your reason for investing in one to have the dividends, that you're going to run into some trouble there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They've also run into some trouble with the cops now. As interest rates rise and a lot of the utility companies we're paying a healthy dividend, that becomes a little bit less attractive if you can get a United States literally, risk-free investment for four or 5%."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Right. It might sound crazy that a utility company would suspend or cut their dividend, but it has happened. Last year, a utility company called Algonquin Power and Utilities actually cut their dividend something like 40% to shore up their finances.', ""Ricky Mulvey: To add even a little bit more nuance, maybe there's a company you like that completely fails the snap test, but maybe has historically been a good stock. One example I talked about recently with Bill Barker on the show was Crocs. I think that's a company for the past few years, it's beaten the market. If one did not have Crocs in existence, people could find alternate footwear, Clog, sandals, that kind of thing."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Yeah, definitely. For me, it would be Costco.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Really?', 'Alicia Alfiere: Yeah.', ""Ricky Mulvey: That would be a very painful loss if I didn't have Costco?"", ""Alicia Alfiere: It would be for sure. We know they pioneered the membership warehouse club, keeps customers coming back. Member retention rate in the 90% range, continues to grow, generate cash, but there is a lot of retail competition and there are substitutes in the space like Sam's Club. If you snapped it away its members including me and I'm guessing you, would definitely feel the loss and be sad about particularly the loss of those bargain hot dogs. But competitors could come in to fill the gap."", ""Ricky Mulvey: If you're a Costco member, you could still get groceries, you could still get tires somewhere else. It would be incredibly annoying and I wouldn't like it very much."", 'Alicia Alfiere: Great.', 'Ricky Mulvey: Alicia Alfiere. Thank you for your time and your insight.', 'Alicia Alfiere: Glad to be here.', ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Casey's General Stores CASY, Enersys ENS, NRG Energy NRG and Arch Resources ARCH are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”"", 'Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.', 'We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.', 'This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.', 'It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.', 'This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.', 'The lower, the better.', 'This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.', 'This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.', 'No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.', ""The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our four picks of the seven stocks that made it through the screen:Casey's General Stores operates convenience stores under the Casey's and Casey's General Store names in 16 states, mainly Iowa, Missouri and Illinois. Casey's offers a comprehensive range of products and services to meet the needs of its customers. In addition to fuel, the stores provide a wide variety of merchandise, including groceries, prepared food, snacks, beverages, tobacco products, health and beauty aids, school supplies, housewares, pet supplies and automotive supplies.The company’s business operating model, omnichannel capabilities, enhanced customer reach and private-label offerings reinforce its position in the industry. Casey's price and product optimization strategies, increased penetration of private brands, and digital engagements are also commendable. The company’s focus on inventory management, technology advancements and data analytics positions it well for future growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CASY’s fiscal 2024 earnings has increased 2.6% to $12.64 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 17.79%.EnerSys engages in manufacturing, marketing and distribution of various industrial batteries. Additionally, the company develops battery chargers and accessories, power equipment and outdoor cabinet enclosures.EnerSys is set to benefit from solid product offerings, a firm focus on product innovation and strengthening demand. Global megatrends, including 5G expansion, electrification, automation and decarbonization, are aiding the company. Improvements in price and sales mix bode well for its Motive Power segment. ENS’ commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends holds promise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENS’s fiscal 2024 earnings has increased 8.3% to $8.23 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.38%.NRG Energy is engaged in the production, sale and delivery of energy and energy products and services to residential, industrial and commercial consumers in major competitive power markets in the United States.The company continues to expand its operation through organic and inorganic initiatives.

NRG Energy’s capital allocation plan will strengthen the balance sheet and increase shareholders’ value through share repurchases and dividend payments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NRG’s 2023 earnings has increased 11.5% to $5.06 per share in the past 30 days. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same once, the average surprise being 4.73%.Arch Resources is one of the largest coal producers in the United States, operating nine mines across the major coal basins of the country. The company mainly produces and sells metallurgical and thermal coal. The locations of its mines and access to export facilities enable the company to ship coal worldwide.The company commenced longwall production at the Leer South mine, which will add 3 million tons of high-quality metallurgical coal annually to its total production. The ongoing rebound in production in the steel industry will create fresh demand for met coal supplied by the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARCH’s 2023 earnings has increased 4.7% to $27.88 per share in the past 30 days.

Overstretched valuations and uncertainty about the timing of Fed rate cuts have dampened investors’ optimism. The S&P 500 is up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index — an outperformer in 2023 — and Dow Jones are down 0.3% each in the initial two weeks of 2024.As a result, the demand for leveraged and inverse-leveraged ETFs has increased as these fetch outsized returns on quick market turns in a short span. We highlight a bunch of the best-performing leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs that have gained in double digits in the past couple of weeks. These include AdvisorShares MSOS 2x Daily ETF MSOX, MAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN CARD, UltraPro Short Russell2000 SRTY, MicroSectors Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN GDXD and Daily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares HIBS. The funds will remain investors’ darlings, provided sentiments remain volatile.The latest Fed minutes show that the central bank wouldn’t cut rates as aggressively as expected for this year. This suggests an uncertain path toward interest rate cuts and reflects a growing sense that inflation is under control (read: 4 ETF Zones Beating the Market to Start 2024).The latest data on inflation, which came in modestly hotter than expected, has dampened market expectations about an interest rate hike as soon as March. Though the job data report for December came in stronger than expected, it also cast doubt on the expectations of March rate cuts. The disappointing manufacturing data also added to the chaos. The U.S. manufacturing sector slipped further into contraction during December, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global, as output declined and the downturn in new orders gathered pace.While the timing of interest rate cuts is uncertain, the Fed penciled in three rate cuts for this year in its last meeting. This shift in its monetary policy approach is a result of gradual control of inflation and aims to support a stable economic environment without triggering a recession or a significant rise in unemployment. Lower interest rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs, which can stimulate economic growth.', 'Leveraged and inverse-leveraged ETFs either create a leveraged long/short position, an inverse long/short position, or a leveraged inverse long/short position in the underlying index through the use of swaps, options, futures contracts or other financial instruments. Due to their compounding effect, investors can enjoy higher returns in a short period, provided the trend remains a friend (see: all the Inverse Equity ETFs here).However, these funds run the risk of huge losses compared to traditional funds in fluctuating or seesawing markets. Further, their performance could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to a shorter period (such as weeks or months).Investors should note that these products are suitable only for short-term traders as these are rebalanced on a daily basis. Further, liquidity can be a big problem as it can make the products more expensive than they appear.AdvisorShares MSOS 2x Daily ETF (MSOX) – Up 32.6%AdvisorShares MSOS 2x Daily ETF is designed for sophisticated investors looking to gain magnified exposure to the U.S. cannabis sector.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This consumer credit company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.96 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.45 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.76% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Synchrony?', ""For Synchrony, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.66%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synchrony will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synchrony would post earnings of $1.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.48, delivering a surprise of +2.78%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Synchrony doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Homebuilding companies have consistently revealed impressive quarterly results, expressing optimism about the growth of new orders and deliveries in the upcoming quarters.The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% brings optimism to the housing market. This stability provides relief for companies like KB Home KBH, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC, Dream Finders Homes, Inc. DFH, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and others. Home prices and borrowing rates are now expected to bridge the gap between demand and supply.Based on various parameters, let’s check whether KBH or MDC is a more profitable stock. It is to be noted that both companies are almost neck and neck in terms of market cap and each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."", 'KB Home — with a market cap of more than $4.81 billion — is a well-known homebuilder in the United States and one of the largest in the state. The company’s growth is driven by the Returns-Focused Growth Plan, which includes the execution of its core business strategy, improving asset efficiency and monetizing significant deferred tax assets.Looking forward to the first quarter and the entirety of 2024, KBH foresees enhanced conditions in the housing market and ongoing positive trends in the supply chain. Leveraging the advantages of its Built to Order model, the company is confident in its ability to effectively navigate potential fluctuations in housing market conditions.MDC — with a market cap of more than $4.03 billion — engages in building and selling single-family detached homes for first-time and move-up buyers under the name “Richmond American Homes.” The company benefits from the Build-to-Order process, which gives it a competitive edge over peers. This approach helps reduce inventory risk, enhances efficiencies in construction and provides predictability for future deliveries.To stay competitive in the current market condition, MDC is offering great opportunities for build-to-order buyers, such as long-term interest rate lock programs and other special incentives. Given the ongoing market scenario, the company aims to increase its land acquisition efforts and improve its market share position.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KBH’s fiscal 2024 earnings indicates a 4.1% year-over-year rise. MDC’s bottom line for 2024 is likely to grow by 4%. KBH’s earnings estimates have moved up in the past seven days and MDC increased in the past month.

Although the stocks have performed impressively, KBH fared better than MDC and the industry.Meanwhile, considering earnings history, KBH and MDC both surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering average earnings surprises of 28.9% and 21.7%, respectively.', 'Return on Equity in the trailing 12 months for KB Home is 15.6% compared with MDC and the industry’s 11.3% and 19%, respectively. This implies that KBH provides more impressive returns to investors than MDC.The industry is clearly undervalued than the S&P 500, with respect to the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average forward 12-month P/E ratio of 10.5, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 20. Hence, it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, KBH and MDC — with a 12-month forward P/E ratio of 8.2 and 10, respectively — are undervalued than the S&P 500 and the industry.Comparing the two stocks, MDC is less pricey than KBH.', 'KBH certainly has the edge over MDC, as it has better price performance and prospects and provides impressive returns to investors.

Later Tuesday, Boeing announced an independent adviser who will lead a review of the company’s quality control.', 'The Wells Fargo report, entitled “FAA audit opens up a whole new can of worms,” noted that Boeing’s quality control and engineering problems have been ongoing for years. After part of an Alaska Airlines] 737 Max 9 jet fell off the plane mid-flight, the likelihood of the US Federal Aviation Administration coming out of its investigation without significant findings was very low.', '“Given Boeing’s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,” the analysts said. “The FAA’s audit is limited to Max 9 for now, but it’s feasible that findings could expand the scope to other Max models sharing common parts.”', 'The analysts believe the investigation increases significantly the risk that Boeing takes a hit to its production and deliveries, and they downgraded the stock to “equal weight,” down from “overweight,” the equivalent of a “buy” rating.', 'Boeing’s (BA) stock tumbled 8% on the report.', 'The FAA last week opened an investigation into Boeing’s quality control after the Alaska Airlines incident. The regulator said the dramatic in-flight blowout on Alaska Airlines 1282 “should have never happened and it cannot happen again.”', 'The door plug, which is supposed to cover up a space left by a removed emergency exit door in the side of the plane, blew off the aircraft and left a gaping hole in the side of the plane. The force of the explosive decompression and subsequent high-speed airflow inside the cabin ripped headrests off seats as the plane flew at 16,000 feet shortly after taking off from Portland, Oregon, carrying 177 people.', 'Some passengers were injured, but in an extraordinary stroke of good luck, no one was seated next to the door plug, and there were no fatalities.', 'The FAA says the investigation will focus on whether Boeing “failed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.”', 'Boeing declined to comment Tuesday, but said it “will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations” in a statement last Thursday.', 'To help respond to those investigations, Boeing is naming an independent adviser to review quality control on its commercial airplane production lines.', 'Boeing Tuesday said a team of outside experts headed by retired US Navy Admiral Kirkland H. Donald “will conduct a thorough assessment of Boeing’s quality management system for commercial airplanes.” The company is following through after announcing last week it would bring an outside adviser to help assess its quality control.', 'Boeing says Donald and his team will also look at “quality programs and practices” in Boeing factories as well as those of Boeing’s suppliers, reporting their findings back to Boeing’s board of directors.', 'In a statement, Boeing CEO David Calhoun said the review will “provide an independent and comprehensive assessment with actionable recommendations for strengthening our oversight of quality in our own factories and throughout our extended commercial airplane production system.”', 'The company would be “taking a hard look at our quality practices in our factories and across our production system,” said Stan Deal, the Boeing executive who oversees its commercial airplane division, on Monday.', 'Ahead of today’s move, Deal wrote in a memo to employees obtained by CNN that the company would be performing more inspections of each 737 before they are delivered. He also said Boeing is now more closely monitoring the work of a key supplier that builds the 737 Max fuselage.', 'Last week, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he was considering requiring “an independent third party to oversee Boeing’s inspections and its quality system.”', 'A week ago, Calhoun acknowledged the company’s “mistake” at a staff-wide “safety meeting,” but he did not specify what that mistake was. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.', 'Although the investigation is ongoing, and it remains unclear what caused the door plug to blow off the plane, two airlines with a large number of 737 Max 9 planes in service — Alaska Airlines and United Airlines — said they found either loose hardware or bolts in the assembly of door plugs on their aircraft. United says its discovery pointed to possible installation issues.', 'In a letter to Boeing last week, the FAA gave the company 10 days to supply any information on the cause of the Alaska Airlines incident. It also wants to know what actions Boeing has taken to prevent it from happening again.', 'Wells Fargo analysts noted in their report that the FAA investigation could take some time to complete, noting many of its probes remain “under investigation” months after the original incidents.', 'All 737 Max 9 planes remain grounded as the FAA works to approve Boeing’s inspection criteria for airlines to assess the safety of the aircraft. The regulator has not provided a timeline of when the planes might return to service. Alaska and United have canceled more than 100 flights a day as they await an all-clear from the FAA.', 'Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.', 'The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.', 'Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”', 'Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.', 'Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA. And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered engine debris onto homes and the ground below.', 'Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted.', '“The Max 7 and Max 10 variants… are now likely to receive greater scrutiny,” they said. “This includes a required safety waiver that, while probably reasonable, looks politically difficult to grant given recent events.”', 'CNN’s Pete Muntean, Chris Isidore and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

That’s adding more political uncertainty into the picture as Washington hammers payers over claims denials and the business practices of pharmacy benefit units.', 'Here’s what experts see coming down the pike for health insurers this year.', 'The number of Americans without insurance coverage is almost certainly going to rise this year as states overhaul their Medicaid rolls, experts say.', 'During the pandemic, continuous enrollment protections led a record number of people to enroll in Medicaid. But earlier this year, states resumed checking eligibility for the safety-net program. Around 14.4 million Americans have been removed from Medicaid\xa0due to the redeterminations process, many for administrative reasons like incorrect paperwork despite remaining eligible.', '“We are going to see an increase in the uninsured rate for children and probably adults as well as a consequence,” said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.', 'The question is how big of an increase, experts said. Redeterminations began in April, but lagging information and state differences in data reporting has made it difficult to determine where individuals are turning for coverage, and in what numbers.', 'Early signs suggest some people losing Medicaid have found plans in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, though it’s probably “a very small percentage,” Alker said. More than 20 million people have signed up for ACA coverage since open enrollment began in November — an all-time high, according to data released by the Biden administration in early January.', 'Experts say the growth is due in part to redeterminations, along with the effects of more generous federal subsidies. Those subsidies are slated to expire in 2025, meaning ACA enrollment should stay elevated until then.', 'But it’s unlikely everyone who loses Medicaid will find a home on the marketplaces. The cost of family coverage without an employer remains out of reach for many Americans.\xa0It’s also too early to determine how many people terminated from Medicaid have shifted into employer coverage —\xa0that data should also emerge as 2024 continues, said Matt Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Brookings Schaeffer Initiative on Health Policy.', 'Federal regulators have also taken a number of actions to try and curb improper procedural Medicaid losses, like cracking down on states with high levels of child disenrollments. Yet,\xa0procedural terminations are unlikely to improve significantly this year, experts said.', '“We do see a very hopeful trend” in some states, like Washington and Oregon, embracing longer periods of continuous eligibility, Alker noted.', 'The government has ramped up ACA marketplace outreach, which — along with macro forces like a strong labor market — are positive signs that individuals no longer eligible for Medicaid may find alternative coverage, whether in the ACA exchanges or through employment.', 'But “it’s likely we’ll see an increase in the uninsured rate. I think the question is how much,” Fiedler said.', 'Healthcare costs are projected to grow much faster in 2024 than the historical average, fueled by inflation, supply chain disruption and labor pressures increasing provider wages. Those costs are burdening employers already stressed by worker mental health and deferred preventive screenings that could worsen health conditions down the line.', 'As a result, employers are investing heavily in mental health and substance use disorder services.\xa0Seven out of ten employers say mental healthcare access is a priority in 2024, and employers say they’ll turn to virtual care providers to address the need, according to a Business Group on Health survey.', 'As a result, employers are increasingly demanding integrated platforms combining different benefits, continuing a pivot away from the point solutions they were deluged with during the pandemic. Payers are racing to meet that need.', 'This year, UnitedHealthcare plans to integrate more than 20 standalone products into a “supported benefits platform,” said Dan Kueter, CEO of the payer’s employer and individual business,\xa0during an investor day in November.', 'Cigna, which focuses on employer-sponsored plans, plans to add more services to its behavioral health navigator to help employers personalize the platform for their employees this year, said CEO David Cordani during a November earnings call.', 'For their part, health insurers are likely to raise premiums and combat hospital reimbursement hikes in 2024 to control costs, according to credit rating agency Fitch Ratings.', 'However, that outlook is complicated by uncertainty around how much elevated care utilization seen in 2023 will continue. Some payers, like UnitedHealth and Humana, are forecasting high utilization, while others like CVS have said they expect it to drop.', 'More payers might pursue mergers and acquisitions or build out internal musculoskeletal management programs to control costs, said Prateesh Maheshwari, a managing director at venture capital firm Maverick Ventures.\xa0Hip and knee surgeries were an oft-cited driver of utilization last year.', 'Still, publicly traded health insurance companies could see their margins moderately decrease in 2024, Fitch said.', 'Surging demand for GLP-1s means insurance coverage for the drugs is expected to increase next year, putting more stress on the nation’s pressured healthcare payment system. GLP-1s, or glucagon-like peptide-1 drugs,\xa0have historically been used to treat diabetes but have shown efficacy in weight loss.', 'The drugs are exceedingly expensive, but that hasn’t stopped people from trying to get their hands on GLP-1s — off-label or not.\xa0TD Cowen predicts GLP-1 sales could reach $102 billion by 2030, with $41 billion of that for obesity.', 'More private payers are considering covering the drugs next year, though the doors to coverage aren’t being thrown wide open. According to a November survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, while 76% of employers provide GLP-1 drug coverage for diabetes, just 27% provide coverage for weight loss.', 'Yet,\xa013% are considering adding coverage for weight loss.', 'As insurance coverage increases, payers will ensure only eligible patients are accessing the drugs through checks like step therapy, said Nathan Ray, head of healthcare M&A at consultancy West Monroe. As a result, access could remain restricted.', 'Payers will also tie coverage for GLP-1s to additional behavioral management programs. That trend has\xa0proved a gold rush for chronic condition management companies and telehealth providers, which have rushed to stand up new business lines for weight loss that include GLP-1s.', '“Things like this, that include the opportunity for medication along with the accompaniment of behavioral change, is where I think the market will go in 2024,” said Heather Dlugolenski, Cigna’s U.S. commercial strategy officer.', 'Proponents of weight loss medication are also eyeing a potential overturn of the ban on Medicare coverage of weight loss drugs next year. A growing number of lawmakers (and drugmakers standing to profit from Medicare coverage) have come out in support of a bill introduced in 2023 to allow Medicare to cover anti-obesity drugs.', 'The bill is unlikely to be prioritized given Washington has a lot on its plate during the election year, but passage isn’t out of the realm of possibility, experts said.', 'More seniors will select Medicare Advantage plans this year, further growing a program that recently saw its enrollment sneak past that of traditional Medicare.', 'In MA, the government contracts with private insurers to manage the care of Medicare seniors. MA has become increasingly popular, swelling to cover 31 million people last year\xa0— a boon for insurers offering the coverage, which can be twice as profitable for private payers than other types of plans.', 'As such, MA plans have been advertising heavily,\xa0trumpeting their supplemental benefits like gym memberships or subsidized groceries. Seniors find those benefits attractive, Brookings’ Fiedler said, and may not understand that MA plans may not cover as much medical care as traditional Medicare.', '”My best bet would be MA enrollment in the near term continues to grow,” Fiedler said. “I don’t think we’re at the ceiling yet.”', 'Despite elevated costs in 2023 from seniors using more medical care,\xa0insurers generally didn’t cut back on plan benefits this year as they continue to compete for members.', 'Major payers in MA, including Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Centene and Kaiser Permanente, expanded their geographic markets for 2024, even as some lagging competitors like Cigna consider exiting MA altogether.', 'Yet, the program hasn’t been without its complications. Payers cried foul last year over tweaks to MA rates, star ratings\xa0and reimbursement audits, with Humana and Elevance suing to stop the changes.', 'MA “should remain a key long-term growth driver for managed care, but we see a more challenging setup in 2024 as weaker funding, risk coding changes, and lower Star ratings combine to pressure margins,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in an outlook report published late last year.', 'Insurers were also plagued in 2023 by congressional hearings and lawsuits over their claims reviews processes, sparking criticism that seniors may not be receiving the care they’re due.', 'Scrutiny from Washington around such practices is likely to continue.', '“We are seeing both in the Senate and House a lot of interest in peeling back the layers of the onion of how big health plans are operating their Medicare Advantage programs. That’s going to continue to be an issue,” said Reed Stephens, a healthcare chair at law firm Winston & Strawn who focuses on risk.', 'Though it’s unlikely that legislation will be passed reforming MA, Reed said. Overall,\xa0regulatory and political turbulence should subside somewhat this year.', 'The rate and marketing changes were “short of the last train out of the station,”\xa0said Brookings’ Fiedler. “The administration is unlikely to want a big fight with MA plans in an election year.”', 'Major pharmacy benefit managers will introduce more options billed as transparent and cost-effective to retain clients after some turned to upstart competitors last year.', 'PBM clients are clamoring for outcomes-based pricing, with structures tying PBM compensation to measures like adherence, according to a J.P. Morgan survey from late 2023. Clients also want transparency, whether more data sharing or full administration models.', 'The changes aren’t revolutionary, but they hint at ongoing distrust of major PBMs from benefits teams, J.P. Morgan said.', 'UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx, Cigna’s Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — which together control 80% of prescriptions in the U.S.\xa0— have all recently launched new programs, partnerships or models they say are more affordable and transparent to meet the demand.', 'The industry is likely to see more moves along those lines in 2024, experts say —\xa0especially as Congress considers legislation to reform PBMs. The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act passed the House in December. The bill is seen as unlikely to clear the Senate, but specific measures, like forced PBM transparency, could make it into larger legislative packages.', 'The passing of measures around transparency could satisfy politicians’ need for a win when it comes to drug pricing without creating meaningful reform in the sector, according to Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut.', 'Yet,\xa0momentum to do something about high drug costs will certainly carry into this year. Presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle are expected to wield the issue on the campaign trail.', '“The companies in those markets are going to have to stay nimble and keep on their toes,” said Winston & Strawn’s Stephens.', 'Companies like UnitedHealth, CVS and Humana will continue building out networks of physical care sites in 2024.\xa0New M&A guidelines from the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission could raise the bar for merger approvals, but the value proposition for insurers to acquire healthcare providers is too high for them to be dissuaded, experts said.', 'Payers will continue to pursue as many deals “as they can find willing, available targets,” said West Monroe’s Ray.', 'By directing members to owned locations for medical needs, health insurers can essentially pay themselves for providing a service, keeping more revenue in-house. As a result, payers — especially those with a large presence in MA, which incentivizes organizations to better manage cost — will stay on the hunt for acquisition targets.', 'While healthcare M&A was relatively slow in 2023,\xa068% of senior leaders in the sector expect deal volume to rise in 2024,\xa0according to a survey by investment bank Jefferies.', 'Optum — which employs or is affiliated with around one-tenth of all doctors in the U.S.\xa0— is already eyeing M&A.\xa0The health services arm of UnitedHealth is currently pursuing an acquisition of a physician-owned clinic chain in Oregon, even as it comes off a number of big provider buys in 2023, including the multi-billion-dollar acquisitions of home health providers Amedisys and LHC Group.', 'Cigna has also said it plans to look for smaller strategic acquisitions to grow its business, after a potential merger with rival Humana crumbled late last year.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business."", 'The previous big move we wrote about was 25 days ago, when the company gained 15.8% after reports from Bloomberg that the company is exploring strategic options, including a potential sale. Bloomberg added that while Ansys is currently consulting with advisers, no definitive decision has been reached, and the company may ultimately choose to continue operating independently. According to a spokesperson from Ansys, ""M&A rumors are not uncommon in our industry, and it\'s our longstanding policy not to comment on them.""', 'Separately, Oppenheimer analyst Ken Wong said, ""We expect shares to trend higher on a Bloomberg report that Ansys is evaluating takeover interest. With a market cap north of $25B, we expect a narrow pool of potential candidates. We see strategic candidates as more likely than a financial partner... We view Ansys\' position as a pure play simulation leader, minimizing potential integration hurdles. Recent large software M&A appear less bound to valuation ratios due to volatile pre/post-pandemic comps, but rather 2021 levels, which would put a range of $400 in play.""', ""The analyst's projected price forecast of $400 represents a potential 30% upside from where shares were traded before rumors of the potential sale broke out. It's worth noting that most sales are executed at a premium, and the stock is likely up in anticipation that existing shareholders can exit at a higher value."", ""ANSYS is down 7.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $327.41 per share it is trading 9.8% below its 52-week high of $362.88 from December 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of ANSYS's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,084."", ""Do you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

Its current customers mainly make electronic components, primarily semiconductors.

Tesla shares in focus this morning. CEO Elon Musk saying he wants more voting power at the EV giant. Writing in a post on X He says he\'s, quote, ""uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robots without having around 25% of voting control.""', ""So Akiko, he does mention in this tweet in this X that he wants enough to be influential, but not so much that he can't be overturned. But it does seem to be the case that he's hinting at potentially, building some of these products outside of Tesla. Looking at some big Tesla Bulls, here we saw commentary from Dan Ives saying, the board and Musk will be able to resolve this."", ""He's estimating in the next three to six months-- really thinks that the shareholders will be fine. And Musk did praise the Tesla board in a following tweet as well and said that he couldn't do it through a compensation package because he still has an outstanding trial in Delaware that's still being resolved. But a bit of a power move here considering some of the issues that Tesla has already been facing with its stock price."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, a few things to note here. He's looking for 25% control. He has roughly 13% control right now. Also, the fact that he's talking about Tesla becoming a leader in the AI and robotics space seems to be an admission that it's not exactly where it needs to be despite past Musk comments. But this is certainly going to be a really tricky decision for the board if it does come to that because this comes at a really, really delicate time for Tesla when you think about the concerns that shareholders have expressed about Elon Musk splitting time between the company's Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter, or X, I should mention."", ""Also, at a time when we have seen EV sales soften, there's been a massive move to price cuts because Tesla certainly isn't the only player as well. It's not just a US story. It's also in the biggest EV market over in China. So it's going to be a tricky balance for the board to make that decision if it does come to that because there are concerns about where Tesla is moving, which direction it's moving at a time of increased competition at its core business, which is really still autos."", ""Well, another tech giant in the news this morning, Apple. Reports suggest the company will remove the blood oxygen sensor from its smartwatches to get around a patent dispute with medical technology company Masimo. They cite a court filing from the health tech company, a story, Rachelle, that we've been following very closely since that deadline passed back in December for Apple to have to take those specific watches off the market as a result of this patent dispute."", ""I will point out, by the way, though, we're talking about their wearables. There's another headline that crossed today that to me is kind of interesting on Apple-- Apple topping Samsung in global smartphone shipments for the first time in 2023. If you look at the revenue breakdown for Apple, it still is about those iPhones, certainly a big win for Apple. Yes, backwards looking but we're still talking about those handsets that are key to the revenue for Apple."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. I mean, you raised a good point because as much headlines as we're seeing about the watch, the iPhone really is their hero product here. So still making that progress there, and I think Apple really considering, is it really worth us to keep going down this road with Massimo? They've tried to make some of the changes. The courts are looking at that and saying, perhaps this might not be enough as they're looking at some of the changes they're trying to make saying, it's not just a software issue."", ""It's a hardware issue as well. We'll have to wonder if, perhaps, they partner with another company on this because health still at the forefront of Apple's ecosystem here and some of the developments that they want to make not just with their phones and tracking as well. But they want to push more in this health space. So perhaps they'll find a different avenue to go down. But it appears that this route-- the blood oxygen sensor involving Masimo seems a bit of a non-starter here."", ""And finally, also taking a look at Synopsys shares jumping as the software company is set to buy Ansys for $35 billion in the biggest tech deal of the year so far. Now this will be a cass-and-stock deal that values Ansys at over $390 a share, which is a 35% premium on the company's 60 day volume-weighted average price as of December 21. Now the deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025."", ""Of course, it is still very early in 2024 as we say this is the biggest tech deal. So it's still very early in the gates here, and a lot of people wondering what is going to be happening with M&A activity. So interesting to see this here. I mean, the company deals in a lot of different products and services, including tennis rackets. So it'll be interesting to see how this benefits them, how this plays out for them, but at least a hint of some positive M&A activity ahead."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, not just the largest M&A deal so far in the year, which is just a few weeks old, but really the largest deal in recent years, certainly, a good harbinger of things to come when you think about it. This does create a design software giant as you described, Rachelle. So if anything, this really is about, is this a sign of that thaw that's coming with M&A deals potentially picking up some momentum here? You see Synopsis shares up more than 3.5% on this deal. So we'll continue to watch that to see where things go.""]"

I will now turn the call over to Charlie.', ""Charlie Scharf: Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2024 before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2023 financial highlights. Although, our improved 2023 results benefited from the strong economic environment and higher interest rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well. We grew net income and diluted earnings per share with higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income as well as higher noninterest income."", 'Our expenses were down from a year ago, benefiting from lower operating losses as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives. As expected, net charge-offs increased from historical low levels and our allowance for credit losses increased as well. We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking credit tightening actions as appropriate. We returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share in the third quarter, and we repurchased $12 billion of common stock. Average loans increased modestly with growth in the first half of the year, offsetting declines later in the year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit tightening actions. Average deposits were down driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher yielding alternatives.', 'The financial health of our consumers remained strong. While average deposit balances per customer continue to decline from their peak, they remained above pre-pandemic levels as wage growth has more than offset increased spending. Having said that, there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed. Consumer spending remained strong. Credit card spend was up 15% for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year, with growth rates strong across all categories, except fuel, which was impacted by lower gas prices. Debit card spending was up 1% for the year. Discretionary spend growth slowed from a year ago while non-discretionary spend was stable. Our risk and control work remains our top priority, and I refer you to the comments I made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain.', ""We continue to execute on our strategic priorities. And while it is early, and we have more to do, we are starting to see improved growth and increased market share in parts of the company which we believe will drive higher returns over time. Let me provide just a few examples. Our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average. We've also been investing in the Corporate Investment Bank. CIB revenue grew 26% from a year ago, and our investment banking and trading market shares increased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite. Additionally, continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns and earnings over the next several years."", ""And while our consumer, small and business banking, commercial banking and wealth and investment management business remains strong, opportunities to increase share are significant. Other accomplishments include we launched a new co-branded credit cards with Choice Hotels, building on the new products we've launched over the last couple of years. We continued to enhance our mobile app, which is driving mobile adoption momentum, adding 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increasing mobile logins 11% from a year ago. Consumers interacted over 20 million times last year with Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant. We exceeded our $150 million commitment to help advance racial equity in home ownership. Our special purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers."", ""For commercial clients, we continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base. We continue to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank, helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors. Throughout 2023, we added new heads and co-heads of equity capital markets, global mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, financial sponsors, health care and technology, media and telecom. We've also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we are making in our trading capabilities, including adding talent and improved technology with a focus on supporting our core clients. Finally, we're launching a partnership with Centerbridge, which helps us provide our middle market clients with access to alternative sources of capital, another example of how we're providing solutions for our clients."", 'Investing in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in 2024, and Mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call. In 2023, we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities. As I mentioned, we simplified the home lending business, which included exiting the correspondent business. We are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus. In the third quarter, we sold private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We also continue to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year, and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation.', ""As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle. We are closely monitoring credit and while we've seen modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations. Our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2024, but I'd like to make a couple of points. First, we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year. And given that we remain modestly asset-sensitive, the implied Fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for NII."", ""Significant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate actions. Mike will give you our expectations for net interest income, but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions, which may be right or may be wrong. We hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful. Second, we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses, but there are several moving pieces, which Mike will walk you through. We will continue to invest what's necessary for our risk and control work. We continue to realize expense efficiencies. And at this point, we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in future. Our expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point."", ""Decisions on how much to invest are dynamic. We closely monitor the outcomes of our investments, and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see. We are focused on our shorter-term results but remain committed to building a well-managed, faster-growing and higher return company over the medium and longer term. I have said and I remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share and returns across all of our businesses. We believe the actions we have taken and continue to take, provide the path to 50% ROTCE. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their dedication, talent and all they do to move our company forward. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. Mike, over to you."", ""Mike Santomassimo: Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. The first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year, some of which Charlie highlighted, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included $1.9 billion or $0.40 per share for the FDIC special assessment, and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million or $0.20 per share for planned actions. These expenses were partially offset by $621 million or $0.17 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 5."", 'Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers. This increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock. We repurchased a total of $12 billion in common stock in 2023, and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in 2024. We will continue to consider current market conditions, including interest rate movements, risk-weighted asset levels, stress test results as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.', 'Turning to credit quality on Slide 7. As expected, net loan charge-offs increased, up 17 basis points from the third quarter to 53 basis points of average loans, driven by commercial real estate office and credit card loans. The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office, while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable from the third quarter. As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak. The losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance, lower appraisals were the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss. We substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout 2023 as criticized and nonperforming assets increased.', ""And while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters given the market fundamentals, and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector, the amounts will likely going to be uneven and episodic. Our commercial real estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to derisk and reduce exposure, and we're using this information to evaluate our allowance, which I will discuss later. Consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $118 million from the third quarter to 79 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by the credit card portfolio, which performed as expected with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing. Nonperforming assets increased 3% from the third quarter as growth in commercial nonaccrual loans more than offset declines in consumer."", 'The increase in commercial real estate non-accrual loans was driven by a $567 million increase in office non-accrual loans. Moving to Slide 8. Our allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase for credit card and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. While the charge offs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance, we are still early in the cycle and after going through our quarterly review process, the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio remained relatively stable at 11%.', 'On Slide 9, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continued to grow, while most other categories declined. I’ll highlight specific drivers when discussing our Operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 122 basis points from a year ago and 12 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in our other deposit gathering businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives. Period end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up $4.2 billion from the third quarter as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in wealth and investment management for the first time in over a year, as well as higher commercial deposits, which included our efforts to attract clients operational deposits.', 'As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 22 basis points from the third quarter to 158 basis points with higher deposit costs across all Operating segments. The pace of the increase was similar to the third quarter. Our mix of deposits continued to shift with our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits declining to 27%. Turning to net interest income on Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest income declined $662 million or 5% from a year ago due to lower deposit loan balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. I’ll provide details on our 2024 net interest income expectations later on the call. Turning to expenses on Slide 11. While our fourth quarter non-interest expense included the FDIC special assessment and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million for planned actions, expenses declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses.', 'While most of the planned actions should result in lower headcount, some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy, which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits, but may not always reduce headcount. Total expenses increased from the third quarter, driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher severance expense. Personnel expense increased $554 million from the third quarter as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits and incentive compensation expense, including certain year-end adjustments, as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower headcount. Turning to our Operating segment, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 12. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances.', 'We’ve been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers, which includes driving digital adoption, simplifying our product portfolio and using technology to automate our operating environment. As our customers continue to shift to lower cost channels, resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes, we’ve reduced our total number of branches by over 280 or 6% from a year ago. At the same time, we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multiyear effort to transform and refresh our full branch network. I’ll highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call. Home lending revenue increased 7% from a year ago. Lower gain on sale margins and originations, as well as lower loan balances were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'We continued to reduce headcount home lending in the fourth quarter, down 36% from a year ago, reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy. Credit card revenue declined 1% from a year ago, driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense, partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 17% from a year ago. Auto revenue declined 19% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression and personal lending revenue was up 13% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 13.', 'Mortgage originations declined 69% from a year ago and 30% from the third quarter, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. As we executed on our strategic objectives, we’ve also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third-party loans serviced, down 18% from a year ago. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for seven consecutive quarters and balances were down 11% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 34% year-over-year, reflecting credit tightening actions. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago, with both discretionary and non-discretionary spend up 2%, with growth in most categories except for home improvement, fuel and travel.', 'Credit card spending continued to be strong was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew with double digit growth rates in every category except fuel, home improvement and apartment apparel. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 14. Middle market banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit related fees, reflecting lower earnings credit rates. Asset based lending and leasing revenue increased 9% year-over-year due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments. Average loan balances were up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset based lending and leasing. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 15. Banking revenue increased 15% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, and stronger treasury management results.', 'As Charlie highlighted, we’ve successfully hired experienced bankers, which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 2% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue and structured products, equities, credit products and commodities. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate. On Slide 16, wealth and investment management revenue declined 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives.', 'The decline in net interest income from a year ago was partially offset by higher asset based fees due to increased market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results reflected market valuations as of October 1, which were higher from a year ago, asset based fees in the first quarter will reflect valuations as of January 1, which were also higher from a year ago. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, driven by decline in securities based lending. Slide 17 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the Operating segments. This decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments.', 'Turning to our expectations for 2024 starting on Slide 18. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. As we look forward there are a number of factors that could impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior to name just a few, all of which we have little to no control over. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate net interest income for 2024. There is more uncertainty than usual given the market’s strong view of rate cut timing in the quantum. Looking at our results, while we had strong growth in full year net interest income in 2023 versus 2022, our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year, driven by the higher deposit pricing and mixed changes.', 'You can see this impact when you analyze our fourth quarter net interest income, which was down approximately 3% from our full year 2023, net interest income of $52.4 billion. Our current expectation is that full year 2024 net interest income could potentially be approximately 7% to 9% lower than our full year 2023. This expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions including; lower rates in the recent forward rate curve, which given our modestly asset sensitive position would be a headwind to net interest income, a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year, reinvestment of lower yielding securities runoff into higher yielding assets, which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio, further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits, as well as continued mix shift from lower yielding products to higher yielding, deposits in our other deposit gathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable and market funding will replace the decline in consumer deposits as needed.', 'We currently expect that net interest income will trough towards the end of this year. As we’ve done in prior years, we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2024 will depend on a variety of factors, which many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing and loan demand. Turning to our 2024 expense expectations on Slide 19. We started our focus on efficiency initiatives three years ago and we’ve successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $10 billion of gross expense saves. Through our efficiency initiatives we have reduced headcount every quarter since third quarter of 2020 and headcount is down 16% since the end of 2020.', 'Looking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right. We reported $55.6 billion of non-interest expense in 2023, which included the $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment. Excluding this item, expenses would have been $53.6 billion, which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of 2024 expenses. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $1.3 billion lower, driven by the $969 million expense we took in the fourth quarter for planned actions, we expect expenses to increase by at least $300 million due to higher revenue related expense, driven by wealth and investment management, revenue related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity and market levels, and therefore could be higher or lower than this estimate.', 'At this point, we expect all other expenses to be flat, though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation. We expect approximately $2.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2024 due to the efficiency initiatives. We highlight in the slide some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond 2024. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure. While we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives, we’re also continuing to invest and we expect approximately $1.1 billion of incremental technology and equipment expense, reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years, as well as new investments planned for 2024.', 'We also expect merit increases of approximately $700 million, which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries. We highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide. Our 2024 expense outlook includes ongoing business related operating losses of approximately $1.3 billion, similar to the level we had in 2023. As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. So putting this all together, we expect 2024 non-insurance expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. It’s important to note that while we’ve made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, as Charlie highlighted, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company.', 'Given how critical it is to continue to invest in our business. On Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for 2024 let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the technology investments we’ve already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers, and we plan to continue investing these areas this year throughout our businesses. We are planning to hire more bankers and advisors to grow our Wells Fargo Premier Offering to our affluent clients. We plan to launch a new travel oriented credit card as part of our autograph suite of products, as well as a new small business credit card this year.', 'To better serve our commercial clients, we plan to continue higher within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth. Now, let me conclude with Slide 21, where we will discuss return on tangible common equity. When we first discussed our path to improving returns on the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we had an 8% ROTCE. Since then, we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns, including executing on our efficiency initiatives, investing in our businesses to help drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend $0.10 to $0.35 per share and repurchasing $32 billion of common stock. These actions help to improve our ROTCE, our reported ROTCE in the fourth quarter was 9%, but as we highlight in the table, our ROTCE was impacted by a number of notable items.', 'Our 2023 returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth, and as I’ve already highlighted, we expect net interest income to decline this year. We still believe, we have an achievable path to a sustainable 15% ROTCE over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company. There are several key factors that support our belief. Our ability to return excess capital, we currently have a significant amount of excess capital, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum buffers for CET1 and as I already highlighted, we expect to increase our share repurchases this year. I highlighted the progress we’ve already made to reposition our Home Lending business, including reducing the amount of third party mortgage loans serviced by 18% from a year ago.', 'As we continue to streamline this business, we expect the profitability to improve. We’ve grown our Credit Card business with balances up 40% since the end of 2021 and new accounts 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition costs and allowance build, and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures. Finally, we’ve made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers, and help drive growth. We expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like Corporate Investment Banking and Wealth And Investment Management will help fund additional investments. So, we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns.', 'In summary, our results in 2023 demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance. We grew revenue, reduced expenses, increased capital returns to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We will now take your questions.', 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.

Shares of AI experts such as Nvidia\xa0and C3.ai\xa0have doubled or tripled over the last year, riding the tailwind of massive interest in generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. Surely it's too late to jump aboard that skyrocketing bandwagon by now."", 'Right?', 'Well, not so fast. Some of the best AI specialists actually missed that boat, too. Their stocks have been left behind the general frenzy, giving astute investors a chance to pick up great AI investments for pennies on the future dollar. In particular, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) offers a tempting combination of modest share prices and market-defining AI expertise.', ""Here's why I think Big Blue's stock is a great buy right now."", 'Let\'s get right to the heart of the problem. Many analysts don\'t see IBM as an AI investment these days, and investors have absorbed that skepticism. For instance, Jefferies analysts recently called Big Blue a ""hidden AI play"" with robust long-term exposure to the AI theme but few immediate catalysts.', ""In other words, firms like Jefferies don't believe that IBM's stock deserves the premium valuations you see for market-darling AI plays like C3.ai and Nvidia. As a result, IBM hasn't even boarded the AI bandwagon yet. Profit-based valuation charts don't make a lot of sense since C3.ai is unprofitable so far, but here's how IBM compares to these AI-sector flagships in terms of price-to-sales (P/S) ratio:"", ""As you can see, IBM's P/S ratio has stayed in the low single digits throughout the ChatGPT-inspired AI furor. Meanwhile, process automation specialist C3.ai trades at 10.5 times sales and Nvidia's stock soars around 30 times sales."", ""That's well and good if IBM really is lacking a robust AI business. However, that's not what I see at all."", ""IBM has been exploring artificial intelligence since before many of its rivals were founded. The journey started in the 1950s when IBMer Arthur Samuels created a self-learning checkers-playing program. The famous Deep Blue system that beat chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 also came from IBM's Amherst headquarters, followed by the Jeopardy!-playing natural language interpretation of the Watson platform in 2011."", ""Lessons learned from these inventive AI adventures (and the decades of research in between) have been packed into IBM's latest AI product, a cloud-based data analysis studio known as Watsonx. This platform helps IBM's customers -- mostly large corporations, not enthusiasts or small businesses -- build, train, and make use of powerful generative AI tools relying on their own business data. If that doesn't sound like a serious AI catalyst to you, I simply don't know how to convince you."", 'IBM is happy to leave consumer-grade playthings to other companies, focusing strictly on an enterprise-grade clientele with the watsonx system. As a result, I expect a rather slow burn as prospective customers often must pass their new tools through many levels of system testing, integration work, management approval, and budgeting. But when the floodgates are open, IBM should enjoy a deluge of AI orders with large and long-term contracts.', ""I don't know whether IBM's AI tipping point will come this year or in 2025, but I'd be shocked if the client-grabbing process drags on any longer than that."", ""And I really don't understand why IBM's bright AI future is so opaque to investors and analysts today. AI has been infused into everything IBM does, including customer-facing products and internal systems. By my analysis, it's only a matter of time before Big Blue's pioneering AI expertise starts to generate big green piles of cash. Until then, you can pick up IBM shares at the modest valuation of 2.5 times sales, 22 times earnings, and 12.5 times free cash flows. The likes of Nvidia and C3.ai just can't compete with this deep-discount value proposition."", ""IBM isn't aiming to ride the booming AI market's coattails, but instead to lead from a very specific niche up front. This tech giant is an AI leader, not a copycat or a wannabe. You don't want to be left empty-handed when market makers finally realize what's going on here.

(NASDAQ:UAL) At US$38.93?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-united-airlines-holdings-inc-103930421.html,1705487970,STORY,['UAL'],"[""Let's talk about the popular United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth of 15% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine United Airlines Holdings’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings ', ""Great news for investors – United Airlines Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 4.46x is currently well-below the industry average of 9.42x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. However, given that United Airlines Holdings’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of United Airlines Holdings, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 5.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.', 'Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since UAL is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UAL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed assessment.', ""So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing United Airlines Holdings at this point in time.

These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2024, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill."", 'William S. Demchak', ""Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. During the challenging and volatile operating environment for the banking industry, PNC performed well during 2023 and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the FDIC special assessment, and expenses related to a staff reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter, we earned $14.10 per diluted share compared to $13.85 per diluted share in 2022. Throughout the year and amidst all the disruption, we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise. Importantly, we generated record revenue and controlled core expenses, which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage.For the fourth quarter, we reported $883 million in net income or $1.85 diluted per share and $3.16 per share on an adjusted basis. Rob is going to take you through the financials in a moment, but I'd like to highlight a few points. First, as we announced in early October, we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from Signature, which is immediately accretive to earnings. Secondly, as we expected, we saw meaningful growth from noninterest income during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees. Third, we completed the actions to reduce our workforce, and we are positioned to realize $325 million of expense savings in 2024. This is in addition to our CIP savings target for 2024 that Rob will discuss in a few minutes.Expense discipline remains a top priority for us. And accordingly, we are targeting stable expenses for 2024, even as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Fourth, our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to growing our balance sheet, while we continue to expect credit charge-offs to increase over time, particularly in the CRE office segment, we're adequately reserved. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we increased our capital position, saw solid improvement in our AOCI intangible book value and repurchased a modest amount of shares.In summary, we run our company with a focus on delivering through the cycle performance and feel very good about our strategy, our capabilities and the strength of our balance sheet as we enter 2024. And we believe we are well positioned to drive growth and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and compared to the third quarter. Loans were up 2% and averaged $325 billion which includes the acquired Signature capital commitment loans. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $4 billion to $42 billion and deposits increased $1.4 billion and average $424 billion. Borrowed funds increased $5 billion to $73 billion driven by higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances.At year-end, PNC was fully compliant with the proposed holding company long-term debt requirements. And we expect to reach compliance with the bank level metrics through our normal course of funding well in advance of the phase-in period. AOCI improved $2.6 billion to negative $7.7 billion at quarter end, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable interest rate movements during the quarter. Accordingly, tangible book value increased to $85.08 per common share, up 9% linked quarter and 18% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.9% as of December 31, which increased 10 basis points linked quarter. Our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio based on the new proposed capital rules would be approximately 8.2% at year-end, which is well above our current requirement of 7%.We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we resumed modest share repurchase activity of approximately $100 million or roughly 0.5 million shares. And when combined with $600 million of common dividends, we returned a total of $700 million of capital to shareholders. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2% driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer. Commercial loans were $223 billion, an increase of $5 billion driven by the acquisition of the Signature capital commitment portfolio. Excluding the $8 billion full quarter average impact from the Signature loan portfolio, commercial loans declined $3 billion or 1% and driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand. Consumer loans grew approximately $130 million, driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances. And loan yields increased 19 basis points to 5.94% in the fourth quarter.Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits grew $1.4 billion to $424 billion during the quarter, as seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 25% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 26% in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect a noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize near current levels. Our current rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.48% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.26% in the prior quarter. As of December 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 44% and in line with our expectation for the quarter.As we stated previously, we expect betas to drift modestly higher, while interest rates remain at current level. And our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid-2024, at which point we believe the rate paid on deposits will begin to decline.Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $137 billion decreased 2% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 2 basis points to 2.59%, reflecting the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of December 31, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.1 years. Our received fixed swaps point into the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on December 31. The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 3 basis points to 2.1% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.3 years.AOCI improved by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion.Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. Fourth quarter net income was $883 million or $1.85 per share, which included pretax noncore expenses of $665 million or $525 million after tax, related to the FDIC special assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding noncore expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.16. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased to $128 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined modestly by $15 million. And our net interest margin was 2.66%, a decline of 5 basis points. Noninterest income increased $143 million or 8%. Noninterest expense of $4.1 billion increased $829 million or 26% and included $665 million of noncore expenses.Core noninterest expense was $3.4 billion and increased $164 million or 5%. Provision was $232 million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was 16.3%. Full year 2023 revenue grew 2% compared to 2022. Core noninterest expense was well controlled and grew 1%. Importantly, our disciplined expense management and CIP savings allowed us to deliver modest positive operating leverage and PPNR growth of 2% on an adjusted basis.Turning to Slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. Fourth quarter revenue was up $128 million or 2% compared with the third quarter driven by strong fee income as net interest income of $3.4 billion was down modestly. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $99 million or 6% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased $141 million or 84%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Asset Management and Brokerage revenue grew $12 million or 3%, reflecting favorable market conditions. And residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $52 million or 26%, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights.Other noninterest income of $138 million increased $44 million or 47% and included favorable valuation adjustments and gains on sales. The fourth quarter also included $100 million negative Visa fair value adjustment compared to a $51 million negative adjustment in the third quarter. As a reminder, at December 31, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.5 billion.Turning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter noninterest expense of $4.1 billion was up $829 million and included $665 million of noncore charges. Core noninterest expense of $3.4 billion increased $164 million or 5% linked quarter, reflecting higher business activity, seasonality and asset impairments. During the quarter, we incurred $42 million of impairment charges, which were large related to building write-offs. Notably, in 2023, we reduced our non-branch footprint by 2 million square feet or approximately 17%. For the full year, core noninterest expense of $13.3 billion increased $177 million or 1%. Expense growth was well controlled due in part to the $50 million midyear increase in our CIP goal to $450 million, which we exceeded.As a result, we generated 41 basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year.Looking forward to 2024, our annual CIP target is $425 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. And as of year-end, we completed actions related to the workforce reduction that will drive $325 million of cost savings in 2024. Taken together, we're implementing $750 million of expense management actions, all of which are reflected in our 2024 guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, we did see a slight uptick in NPLs and delinquencies. Nonperforming loans increased $57 million or 3% linked quarter and included a $12 million increase in CRE.Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion increased $97 million or 8% linked quarter. The increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies, the majority of which have already been resolved. Net loan charge-offs were $200 million in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations. Our annualized net charge-off to average loans ratio was 24 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.5 billion or 1.7% of total loans on December 31, stable with September 30. The CRE office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress and fourth quarter net loan charge-offs were $56 million. We continue to expect future losses on this portfolio. However, we believe we've adequately reserved for those potential losses. As of December 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.7% of total office loans and inside of that, 12.9% on the multi-tenant portfolio.Importantly, our overall CRE office portfolio declined 6% or approximately $550 million linked quarter, reflecting a higher level of payoffs. Criticized office loans were flat and nonperforming loans increased 2% linked quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions and a full update of this portfolio is included in the appendix slides.In summary, PNC reported a solid fourth quarter and full year 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in mid-2024 with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024, when we expect the Fed to begin to cut rates. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in July, November and December. Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2024 compared to 2023 results is as follows: we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of approximately 1%.Total revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of 4% to 5% and noninterest income to be up 4% to 6%. Core noninterest expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. Our outlook for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 is as follows: we expect average loans to be stable; net interest income to be down 2% to 3%; fee income to be down 6% to 8% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter capital markets and advisory levels. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity. Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be down 3% to 4%. We expect total core noninterest expense to be down 3% to 4%. We expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.', 'John Eamon McDonald', ""Wanted to ask Rob and Bill about the loan growth outlook for 2024, the spot guidance of up 3 to 4 percent seems a bit better than what we're seeing in H.8 currently. And I thought you could give some color on the drivers of your outlook there."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Sure. John, it's Rob. Yes. On the outlook, so average loans up 1%, spot 3% to 4%, as you mentioned. We see most of that being on the commercial side and most of that being on the back end of the year. Consumer, we do have some growth throughout the year, but pretty modest."", 'John Eamon McDonald', ""Okay. And Rob, on the net interest income guidance, it sounds like you're assuming 3 rate cuts, a little bit less than what the forward curve has. Just kind of wondering what would be the sensitivity if the forward curve played out, we saw more rate cuts than what you're assuming. Is that helpful to the NII outlook, all else equal or relatively neutral? Could you update us on the sensitivity there, please?"", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Sure, John. Yes, the short answer is it's relatively neutral because, as you know, we've worked hard to get our balance sheet into a neutral sensitivity position. So not a lot of variance in terms of the forwards and our own expectations in terms of the impact on NII. The big question, obviously, is going to be on deposit pricing and how that behaves as the year plays out, but we don't expect a lot of variance."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.', 'John G. Pancari', 'On the capital markets revenue, the numbers certainly came in really solid this quarter. As you look into 2024 and in the context of your up 4% to 6% noninterest income guidance for the full year. How are you thinking about capital markets trajectory through the year off of this level?', 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Yes. So with capital markets, we did get the rebound that we were expecting in the fourth quarter and the bulk of that is in our Harris Williams, our M&A advisory business. As far as '24 guidance goes, we expect the pipelines are good. We expect sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of '23 to be the range of what we would see on a quarterly basis going through in 2024. The anomalies were the soft quarters of Q2 and Q3 in 2023. So take a look at the first quarter of '23, the fourth quarter of '23, and that's the range of what we would expect the quarterly run rate to be through '24."", 'John G. Pancari', 'Got it. All right.', 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""I'll even help you there, John. It's up about 20% year-over-year. I'll save you the math there."", 'John G. Pancari', ""Yes. All right. And then on the -- your guidance for 2024 implies about 100 basis points negative operating leverage using the midpoint of the guidance which actually screens relatively well versus your peers. How sustainable is that if the -- if the rate environment does not pan out as you're modeling and or better put, if your revenue outlook is worse? Do you think you can sustain at that expected negative 100 basis points operating leverage? Or could it be worse?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""Look, we're fairly neutral to the -- for our NII forecast toward as a function of rate cuts or not. So the outcome ought to be the same."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Yes. Well, I would add to that, John. The -- so we worked hard. We took some actions to position ourselves to have stable expenses year-over-year. So that's a lot. And then as Bill pointed out on the revenue side, the NII is fairly predictable on a relative basis outside of rates and then the fees, we feel good about the guidance. So that's what we think is going to occur."", 'William S. Demchak', ""I think if there's variance anywhere, it's going to be on our assumptions as it relates to deposit betas, the continued shift to interest-bearing versus noninterest-bearing and ultimately, the steepness of the yield curve, the rates at the long end of the curve as opposed to the front end of the curve. We've tried to be to the best of our ability a little bit on the conservative side of all of those things. And we feel pretty good about where our forecast is."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.', 'Robert Scott Siefers', ""I was hoping you might be able to share just some updated thoughts on sort of where and when NII might bottom. And I think perhaps more importantly, magnitude of rebound that I might see thereafter. I know you sort of suggested last month that NII ultimately could be a record in 2025. I guess I'd just be curious for any updated context around your thoughts there."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Yes. Sure, Scott. Yes. So as we pointed out, we do see NII going down in the first half of the year, troughing around the time of the cuts and then growing from there and beyond. So think about where we are now, go down a bit and then grow back to where we are now. And then in 2025 what gives us a lot of confidence around record NII is we will get the compounded effect of the repricing of our fixed rate assets as that continues into '25. So that's what we laid out a month ago, and that's still what we think."", 'Robert Scott Siefers', ""Perfect. Okay. And then I guess just on the notion of deposit pricing. It sounds like you're expecting deposit cost to ease right around the time the Fed starts cutting. What's your sense for the sort of the pace of deposit betas on the way down vis-a-vis what they were on the way up?"", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Well, I would say on the commercial and the high (inaudible) side fast. And then we talked about on the consumer sort of the core consumer, we could -- and this is what Bill was alluding to there earlier, we could continue to see some drift up in rate paid even though we get some cuts. So that's a big variable, obviously, and we'll have to play it out."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""Thanks for outlining the macro assumptions behind the outlook and I appreciate your comments on loan growth being more back-end loaded. But can you give us some more color on how you're thinking about it? Because you also mentioned a mild recession midyear. So is it really a big uptick in CNI in maybe like 4Q as rates begin to come down and as we come out of that mild recession? So I was hoping you could give us some more color on both commercial and consumer there."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', 'So I would just say just to follow up on that. So yes, back half of the year on the commercial side, we see the uptick in the third and the fourth quarter. A big part of that being expected increase in utilization, which is a little bit lower right now and then just some pickup in general economic activity, not a lot, 3% to 4% spot to average up 1%. And then on the consumer, just sort of slow, steady growth, nothing big there, maybe a little bit more in card and auto and a little bit less in resi.', 'Manan Gosalia', 'Got it. And then just on the credit side, last quarter you had some CRE loans move from criticized into NPLs. And it looks like things have been pretty steady this quarter on both criticized and NPLs. So do you think at this stage, you guys have scrubbed the books and it should remain steady over the next few quarters with just NCOs ticking up? Or is it likely to be lumpy? The question is more, given the new outlook for rates to come down, do you think the worst is behind us?', 'William S. Demchak', ""Well, not on charge-offs. We think we're reserved correctly, but you have to remember that as these loans go to NPL and eventually, if we have charges against them, we'll charge them off. It won't run through P&L because we've already created a reserve for it, but the work set on actually maturing the loans and dealing with the outcome is yet to come."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Yes. And I would just add to that. The key number to look at there is the criticized percentage, which has not changed much. To Bill's point, that's the first bucket. The movement of that to nonperforming or charge-offs will occur, but it's that criticized number, that's the key number."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', 'Can you guys share with us -- you talked, Rob, about the commercial loan growth in the quarter when you ex out the Signature purchase was down slightly. I know you have prospects for growth here in 2024, as you pointed out. But can you share with us, do you guys see much competition from the private credit market, the private equity guys that have been much more aggressive recently in lending? And second, on part of that, do you have them as customers as well? So do you have to balance them as competitors as well as customers?', 'William S. Demchak', ""We don't compete with them head-to-head with the types of loans that are typically and because we don't play that that much in the unsecured leverage space. Most of the decline at Signature we saw was in utilization."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', 'And some seasonal.', 'William S. Demchak', ""Yes, as we go forward, more and more of the lending markets are moving into private hands and longer term that is of a concern if they kind of move up scale in what they do. We do serve them. I would say that our client base with just call it, private equity or private managers at large, they're probably our largest clients between what we do with and for them from Harris Williams and Solebury and business credit and treasury management with their portfolio companies and on and on and on. So they are good clients. And I guess, at the margin, we could end up competing with them in certain things."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', 'But not so much today.', 'William S. Demchak', 'Yes.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""I see. Okay. And then, Rob, the follow-up with your comments you gave us the Visa ownership and the unrealized gain. If I recall correctly, I think first quarter of '24 the owners of those shares are permitted to monetize that. Can you give us share of your updated thoughts on what you guys are thinking with your position in Visa."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Yes, sure, Gerard. So our position is -- we have $1.5 billion in unrealized gains, 3.5 million B shares. As you pointed out, there's a vote by the Visa shareholders at the end of this month to approve an action to enable the B holders to monetize maybe up to 50%. So we don't control that. We see when the vote is scheduled, should it be approved, then we'll move forward with our monetization plans that would be allowed under whatever is approved."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.', 'Bill Carcache', ""Following up on credit, if we play out what the soft landing scenario could look like and the Fed starts cutting rates in mid-24, would you expect to be in a position to possibly start releasing reserves? Or are the sort of likely to still be late cycle concerns that would lead you to want to maintain the reserve levels that you've already established?"", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Bill, it's Rob. So first, our reserves are appropriate for what we expect to occur. So that's number one. Number two, if things should substantially improve, yes, sure. We're running at 1.7% right now, which historically is on the high side. So if things normalize out in your definition of normal, we could be lower."", 'Bill Carcache', ""Got it. And then, Bill, following up on your comment about feeling good about your reserve levels, but that we haven't necessarily seen peak charge-off rates yet. If we were to go down the mild recession scenario path, should we expect there to be some lag between when those charge-offs would actually hit the P&L and when the corresponding reserves would get released? Or would the releases kind of occur concurrent with the increase in charge-offs?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""So remember, the charge-offs don't hit P&L. There seems to be a lot of confusion on that. The provisions we take hit P&L, and we've provided for our best expectation of future charge-offs in a scenario that assumes a mild recession. So if our scenario comes true, we're fully reserved for everything that might happen to us. Charge-offs will flow through, but not hit our P&L because they're effectively neutralized against the debit to the provision."", 'Bill Carcache', 'Understood.', 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""That's worth pointing out. That's worth pointing out."", 'William S. Demchak', 'There always seems to be some confusion on that. But do you -- does that make sense?', 'Bill Carcache', ""Yes. No, I understand. I guess where I was going with that is that some have sort of alluded to you allowing as if the credit environment does indeed deteriorate, allowing some of those losses to flow through without necessarily releasing reserves. And so even though they've established reserves, they would kind of maintain those reserves and allow the higher charge-offs to flow through before ultimately releasing. And I was just hoping to get your thoughts on kind of the timing of those different pieces."", 'William S. Demchak', ""So it's a mechanical calculation that's dependent on our view of the economy at the time. So if you got to a place where the charge-offs occur and somehow we thought the economy was worse than our current expectation, we would be providing for the remainder of the portfolio at a higher level than we are today, right? But right now, we don't expect that to happen. So if the economy is worse, simply put, if the economy is worse than a mild recession, then you would expect our total reserve to increase."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Because it's forward-looking per CECL."", 'Bill Carcache', ""Understood. And if I could squeeze in one last one on capital return. I appreciate Slide 19. Can you speak to how you're thinking about that 150 basis point impact from Basel III endgame in light of some of the pushback that it's received. And is that 8.2% a level you'd feel comfortable running at? Or would you target a slightly higher buffer? And then sort of underlying all of that, are you thinking -- how are you thinking about buybacks in light of all the moving pieces?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""We'll answer the easy question first. 8.2 would be too low, I think, in this new environment, assuming Basel III endgame goes. So we'd run some higher number than that for certain. There does appear to be substantial commentary on the proposal such that I would expect that if it isn't reproposed, there still would be some relief in certain asset categories and risk-weighted assets and maybe on operating risk capital, we'll see. Having said that, we don't know. So at the moment, what we know is we're going to continue to grow earnings. We're going to accrete AOCI back into our capital base, and we're going to pull that 8.2% up. We think we have flexibility inside of that to be active in the share repurchase market between now and then and the more certainty we have, the more certain we'll be an explicit on what we might buy back during a given period of time."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', 'And I would just add to that. You saw we did -- we bought just under $100 million of -- sorry, share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we would expect to do at least that, maybe a little bit more depending on market indications.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.', 'Erika Najarian', ""I just wanted to ask one follow-up question on NII, if I may. A lot of investors were really excited about the graphic that you put together at Goldman, the Nike Swish, if you will, that had sort of the first rate cut embedded under the Nike Swish, 25 basis points in 3Q '24. And I completely understand this is abstract in a way. But I just wanted to put together everything that you guys said. I think it surprises investors that when you overlay the forward curve that it is neutral to this outcome, at least for '24. But it's -- but just looking back at the slides, Rob, on Slide 6 of this earnings season, it does seem like a lot of your receipts fixed swaps don't really meaningfully mature until 4Q '24. So I guess, in terms of like the mechanical repricing that you keep talking about, the way to really ask this question is, it sounds like it is possible to have potentially a lower trough than people expected in '24 and still have that record net interest income in '25 because of those fixed rate dynamics. And who knows what can happen on the liability side and the deposit repricing side, if the Fed cuts sooner. But it feels like that swap maturity is part of why that Nike Swish could be steeper. Am I thinking about it the right way?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""I don't know that we expect it to be deeper. We purposely drew the line to be a little bit thick because we don't know exactly when that trough might occur. I think all of the commentary on '25 is in some ways, mechanical. We're simply taking our fixed rate assets and repricing them at market. And we know what the maturities of those assets are. So in short form, one of the reasons we highlight that and also show the steepness of the curve is our balance sheet, the fixed rate assets on our balance sheet are shorter than virtually all of our peers and at a yield level that is somewhat lower. So we have a big pickup in fixed rate earning yields sooner than I think the market expects, which is turn what gives rise to the slope of that curve, whether it troughs in the second quarter or the first week in the third quarter or the fourth week and -- who knows."", 'Erika Najarian', ""I don't think it's the perfect timing, though that investors are worried about in terms of second quarter and third quarter. It's just that your new guidance would imply sort of after the first quarter, that your average NII would be like 3%, 3.7% or something like that, right? So to get to a record net interest income, it would have to be a pretty significant progression from there. So that's sort of -- I'm trying to set the stage for you guys to build that bridge because I think that investors really believe that you can reach that."", 'William S. Demchak', ""I think that if you want to call it the Swish, I think the Swish is still accurate. What else to say, it's consistent with our guidance. And it's still accurate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.', 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', 'Just a follow-up on that swaps book on Page 6 of the deck.

Demchak', ""I don't know that we had changes this quarter."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Going into Q1 '24. Is that the question, Ken?"", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""You terminate any swaps this quarter and add any new and just kind of to remind us of the understanding of what's still yet to go after?"", 'Robert Q.

What are you trying to get at."", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Yes. I was just trying to get at just what changes you've made inside of the portfolio outside of the normal maturity schedule, which I think we see in the disclosures quarterly? Just wondering did you terminate swaps, did you add some new ones? And then just remind us about the way forward."", 'William S. Demchak', ""We terminated 3.6 and added some. And just to remind you, when you terminate you basically lock that loss to the life of the original contract.

Good to see, first of all, in the fourth quarter, the capital markets improvement that you saw. Just wondering how much of a driver is that of your expected fee growth next year, your pipelines in Harris Williams, et cetera? And what other pieces do you expect to see growth in this year?', 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""Yes, Ken, just as I said earlier, on the capital markets, a nice rebound in our Harris Williams activity. Pipelines are good. They support year-over-year growth of close to 20%, which is what I mentioned earlier. In terms of the other fee categories, asset management flattish up a bit, that will be market-dependent. Card and cash management up low to mid-single digits. Lending and deposit services, that will be down mid-single digits, and that's reflective of anticipated lower service charges on deposits. There was a number of items that we did in '23 to reduce overdraft charges for our clients, so that's good for our clients, but that will be some lower fees, about mid-single digit down.

Scale is more important than ever. I could give the whole speech, but it was -- it seemed like a passioned speech, more than I\'ve ever heard you say before. So why now? And along those lines, I mean, if you had better scale when you get positive operating leverage in 2024, with a chance you could do that. But I think you\'re talking further out. I think you\'re talking about organic and maybe inorganic expansion, but help me out there, if you could.', 'William S. Demchak', ""No, I was. Look, if you just look back at what happened this year on top of kind of 8 or 9 years of history post the financial crisis. We've seen your words Goliath win in terms of organic deposit share growth. That trend line has accelerated as a function of the mini crisis in March, where corporates bluntly don't necessarily trust the regulatory environment to ensure that their deposits at a bank are safe. And so we've seen those deposits flow uphill. And if you aren't a primary relationship with that corporate deeply embedded with treasury management and other services you net-net lose corporate deposits.I think when you combine that with the cost of technology, the removal of some of the tiering and regulation and capital requirements and liquidity, scale matters. I think we are -- on net benefited from the mini crisis, but just barely -- and I think below us, people struggle with that conversation with corporate clients. Above us, perhaps it's easy. But I think we need to move into that next level such that we are seeing coast-to-coast is a ubiquitous standard brand, with the quasi support that the giant banks have in terms of times of crisis. I think it's critical."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""So what does that mean? Okay, so you've identified the need and desire. So what does that mean? Does it mean..."", 'William S. Demchak', ""Yes. So naturally, over time, we are gaining share on our newer markets at a rapid pace. And we see that client acquisition and growth in all forms from deposits to loans to fees to so forth. I think through time, you're going to see a clear differentiation of this dynamic played out across the market. I think there's going to be banks that are looking for strong partners, and I think we are a strong partner. I'm not going to force that issue. But I think longer term, we are a natural player in the consolidation of an industry where scale matters."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""And if you can't get the deals done, you've been opportunistic with National City and et cetera, since then, organic ubiquity, how can you get there?

There's 5,000 banks in the country that I can take from and grow, right? That's just a longer period of time, which we will pursue than what we might see if there's inorganic opportunities when people come to the realization that they're kind of riding something down in a deteriorating franchise. I can -- I can see the trends. I know how we would react to opportunities and the trends.

I think somebody asked that question once before, and I assure everybody, I still know how to do math and I think the opportunities will come our way. I don't think we'll have to chase them. One of the reasons people say why am I as vocal about this as I am. And part of the reason is to make the public aware, the public being regulators, politicians, boards of other banks aware of what's happening in the banking industry and the need for consolidation.

Or are you seeing weakness across your customers?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""It's not -- I mean you see the credit metrics, it's not a concern in terms of customers. We've seen with the margin -- profit margins decrease with certain clients. If you look at soft inputs, surveys and so forth that are coming out of the Fed districts, the economy is definitely weakening, not at a alarming pace. It's kind of what we had expected given how tight the Fed has gotten with monetary policy. So we kind of see a mild recession. We actually see employment remaining strong through that, which ultimately is the thing that keeps the economy from going deeply into recession, just the strength of the labor market and consumer spending.

Reilly', ""Well, I think obviously, we've been watching that for the better part of the year here in terms of the decline in noninterest-bearing in absolute terms and relative percentages. Why we think it's largely happened is because it's been so long. And much of that base is our businesses and individuals that run on noninterest-bearing deposits.

Demchak', ""I mean I don't think there's going to be any structural delevering here. We're obviously seeing a lot of banks kind of on my prior point, coming to the conclusion that some of the ancillary lending activities they took on, on the back of the big stimulus don't make sense anymore. So there's deleveraging maybe across the industry by certain groups, but not here."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""And I guess I've met from customers, right? Look, even if rates go down a little bit, they're still structurally a lot higher than they've been for the last almost 15 years. So if you just think about like the lending demand that's out there. Obviously, there's lots of factors. But just thoughts on if higher rate structure have a meaningful impact on that."", 'William S.

I mean how much we put in each bucket as far as your delta versus peer when it comes to commercial loan growth?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""Look, I would tell you that we're winning more than we're losing on pitches. And that's more true today than it was pre-March. We're winning at a higher percentage just because there's more shots on goal in the new markets than we are in the old markets. So the growth there is higher, and that's -- those new markets and the fact that we have them fully staffed, including products might differentiates us in a world where total loan growth may be somewhat tepid. And importantly, we've said this for years as we go into new markets, we are not leading with credit in these new markets. Fee-based growth actually outpaces our loan-based growth in those markets as we cross-sell into TM and other products and services. So we look at pipelines, we look at line of sight into what we have in each market. I don't know that there's any particular product that stands out as something that's growing faster than another one. It's just we're winning clients."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', 'How much -- last follow-up. How much faster would your commercial loan growth be if there were no private capital competitors right now?', 'William S. Demchak', ""I think the only way that impacts us directly. I mean that the margin may be something in business credit. And as you know, we partner with a lot of the private credit guys inside of that business. And then to the extent companies are taken private, which I think is going to slow down given the cost of capital, we sometimes will lose a client to a leverage lender because they were taken private. But that's kind of..."", 'Robert Q. Reilly', ""A structure -- that's it right -- that would be the margin. If that wasn't available that would otherwise be a conventional loan."", 'Operator', 'And we have a question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.', 'Vivek Juneja', ""Bill, question for you. I mean when your deposits as the Fed keeps growing, at what point are you thinking about putting some of that or locking some of the yields on that? What's your thinking there, especially given all your other commentary about rates peaking, mild recession, loan growth, et cetera, triangulating all of those factors?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""Well, in the near term, we think the market's got ahead of itself. I think until we're clear of the outcome here or clear inflation and Fed actions, we're happy to kind of stay neutral. I think my own expectation here, Vivek, is notwithstanding what the Fed does through the course of '24 with the Fed funds rate. My expectation is you're not going to see a lot of action in the longer rate simply because of the supply calendar and the fact that inflation will have a tail and while the Fed could ease somewhat, I think inflation is still going to be running against versus their goal. We'll have a lot of issues. So long story short, we don't see a burning desire to put money to work here because we think that opportunity is going to remain and the durations we typically invest in and probably get a little bit better just given how hot the market got post the last Fed meeting."", 'Vivek Juneja', ""And second one, you talked about a lot of companies going into private hands and obviously, that creating competition from private credit for loans. But on the other hand, you've got increasing capital requirements so which is translating into higher spreads, so as to maintain returns. How do you balance that out, on the one hand, not losing share to the private market and on the other hand, maintaining that? Do you see -- given that, do you see spreads staying high? Or do you think that turns course the other way?"", 'William S. Demchak', ""So again, we're kind of talking about 2 different universes of credit. But having said that, I'm sure you've heard this inside of your own shop. Lending money for the sake of lending money doesn't give us an adequate return on capital. Didn't before, it doesn't now. What gives us a return on capital is the relationship, the annuity-like fees you get from TM, the additive fees you get from capital markets-related activity and price is kind of a third order effect on the return on capital we get with that client relationship. Private credit at the moment sees a return in private credit because they could put some leverage on it, and there's not a big opportunity in private equity and yields are high. And I'll chase that for a period of time. I don't know that, that's a particularly great investment through the cycle, and we don't try to compete with it in that lending environment."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time.', 'Bryan K. Gill', 'Okay. Well, thank you very much for participating in the call. And if you have any follow-ups, feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you, and good luck this quarter.', 'Robert Q. Reilly', 'Thanks, everybody.', 'William S. Demchak', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'That does conclude the conference call for today.

The company managed to grow its revenue and average loans and deposits, which is crucial for a bank's profitability and stability.

These achievements are particularly important for banks, as they are indicators of financial health and the ability to withstand economic fluctuations.', ""Key metrics from PNC's financial statements include a 2% revenue increase in Q4, driven by strong noninterest income growth. Core noninterest expenses rose by 5%, reflecting higher business activity. The balance sheet showed a 2% increase in average loans and a modest growth in average deposits. The net loan charge-offs were $200 million, representing 0.24% annualized to average loans.

ISRG is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism, led by solid 2023 results and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front, is expected to contribute further.

The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.', 'On ISRG’s third-quarter 2023 earnings call, the installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 13% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 6% from the prior-year quarter’s level.', 'Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.', 'Per management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging have enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply-chain management.', 'Strong Q3 Results: ISRG’s solid third-quarter 2023 results also buoy optimism. Revenues were primarily driven by continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume. Intuitive Surgical has also been raising the price of procedures to fight inflationary pressure that also aided sales growth. Meanwhile, the absence of any significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the third quarter seems promising, which may accelerate procedure growth going forward. Although gross margin contracted, operating margin improved during the third quarter (as anticipated). The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well.', 'Risk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such trainings.', 'Intuitive Surgical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

Jason, thanks for joining me."", 'Jason Moser: Happy to be here.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a med tech company near all-time highs a conversation with a business that fits into the intersection of the legal system and financing. But Jason, we are kicking off today with rules and regulations. Today is the SEC deadline to weigh in on one of several applications for a Bitcoin spot ETF. But the drama started a little early on this one. We had some interesting news yesterday about this."", 'Jason Moser: Yes, we did.', ""Dylan Lewis: It's funny like I've always say anything, at least in my mind it's hackable. I guess that's one of the arguments for crypto or Bitcoin is like it's this clear ledger and it's unhackable or the fraud obviously is not the same. I'm not a problem. But clearly somebody got hacked here in regard to this announcement. I wonder if that isn't just a foreshadowing of what could eventually come here. But yeah, it seems like the SEC is meeting to figure out whether they want to go ahead and approve the spot Bitcoin ETF structure. I think that they're going to do that, but you've got EXE saying one thing, you've got the SEC saying another, somebody got hacked somewhere and somehow this got out there and I don't know how it happened, but here we are. It does seem to me though, that this is likely something that will be approved and really as a crypto skeptic, I'm not a crypto guy, not that there's anything wrong with crypto if that's your thing, that's cool, whatever."", ""Don't at me on this one. But it is something where I think this type of structure, these spotty TFs, could bring transparency to an industry that really does need it. I think approval of this will ultimately be a good thing and could make it maybe a bit more of a legitimate and understandable market for more investors. Yeah, if you are looking for official word on this, what we saw from the SEC on EXE yesterday, not actually from the SEC. [laughs]. Their account was compromised. We will wait for the agency to officially weigh in and we should have word today. Unfortunately, we're taping a little bit early in the day so we won't have their answer as we're having this conversation. But I look at this Jason and I don't necessarily have a horse in the race when it comes to crypto as obviously it's good for adoption if you're a bull on the crypto space and even if you're not necessarily a crypto bull, I look at this and I say if you are someone who is a fan of investors generally having more protection. Generally having more safeguards with where they're put the money. Probably a good thing too."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think you're right, I agree there. Like I said, it's not something I'm terribly interested in. But from the perspective of bringing more transparency, more accessibility, I think that's a good thing. Because when you look at crypto now, I mean in general, you have to kind of jump through some hoops to be a crypto investor. But it's becoming easier. I mean, I think the idea behind this right now is though that, for your every day investor who's looking maybe to invest in a digital currency via their traditional brokerage. I mean, your options are limited. You're going through ultimately a futures based Bitcoin ETF, for example, which is ultimately utilizing derivative contracts to come up that pricing. It's just added layers of complexity and ultimately, I guess it's just not as transparent as it could be. That's what we're hoping this decision could do, is ultimately bring more transparency to an industry that definitely needs it."", ""Dylan Lewis: As I mentioned, we're taping before the SEC's decision. We won't know for sure where this one's heading. But I will add the take that I think I always add when we see an incident like this where regardless of the business or the security or whatever in the mix when it comes to a hack, basically an advertisement for identity management and cybersecurity companies."", ""Jason Moser: Oh man, I mean, it just cybersecurity these days. It is such a hard space. I mean, that's probably a whole another show we could do just talking about that. Because it is just this ever evolving threat that's never going to go away. I mean, you look at investing in something like cybersecurity, it can be really difficult because the companies that are doing really well today, they may be rendered obsolete tomorrow and so honestly, when I look at investing in something like a cybersecurity, I would probably opt for something like an ETF that gives you broad exposure to a number of the companies that are helping shape in advance the space."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with the government theme here. The Biden Administration is set to unveil some new rules affecting independent contractors and gig economy businesses. Jason, we're still waiting on full details for this, but the broad stroke that I'm seeing is if contractors are economically dependent on a company, they will likely be entitled to more benefits and legal protections from that business. Of course, as soon as you hear some of the elements of this and the themes here, head immediately goes to the gig economy, businesses, the Ubers, the Lifts, the DoorDashes of the world. What's the impact for a company like that?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think for sure the one guarantee from this is the lawyers are going to win. But because the decision that's made, it's going to go through the court system and ultimately that's probably going to take some time. This is an interesting one. I looked to Uber as sort of the easy example to go by here and how this could impact a business because, I recommended Uber in one of my services back in June of 2022. The stock is up 150% since then, and one of the biggest risks at that time was that California Proposition 22, which essentially was this. I mean, this was just this and that. In a nutshell, I would be interested to know from the worker himself, like, would you rather be a contractor or would you rather be a full time employee? My guess is that it's going to vary. Some love the flexibility, some would love the certainty. I'm not sure ultimately how this ends up. I think regardless, for companies, it is something that if they're required to maintain these employees as full time employees and not contractors, and that pushes those costs up. Well, consumers are going to see that at higher prices, I mean, your Uber bill is going to go up, your Lift Bill is going to go up, your door dash bill is going to go up. Then I look to the companies that can navigate these waters most effectively. I think that's where scale, I think that's where size really matters. You look at it like a company like Uber. I mean, because ultimately it's not something that's specific to, Uber is specific to any business that wants to employ this business model and so you have to look to the biggest and the strongest as the companies to be able to manage those waters most effectively. If it does end up pushing costs up, then likely they'll pass at least some of that on to consumers."", ""Dylan Lewis: You just mentioned before that this has been the existential risk the entire time for companies that are operating in this space. I look at this and I think you're right. I think the big companies continue succeed and do very well. I also think we've started to experience the convenience of this style of business."", 'Jason Moser: Yeah.', ""Dylan Lewis: I don't know that higher costs are necessarily going to move consumers away from it."", ""Jason Moser: I don't think they will. I think a time ago it would it would have played more into the calculus. But I think that what we've seen over the last decade plus, and really I hold Amazon primarily responsible for this. I'm not complaining because, listen, I love Amazon and the convenience that all of these companies offer us today. But they have done a tremendous job in helping us value things a little bit differently. It's not just about the lowest prices anymore. I mean, convenience matters, time matters, and they've really hooked us on the convenience that a lot of their business models offer us, whether it's having something delivered to us or delivering us somewhere."", ""Jason Moser: They got in, I think early on, built up those user bases lift to a lesser extent. I think we've seen Uber rise above Lyft in that regard. But they've done a very good job of getting us hooked to the convenience. Like we were talking about pre-production, now this is wired behavior. That's that value. When you become a verb and I need to Uber something or I need to Netflix something, there's a lot of power that comes with that, pricing power included. I think it makes us focus a little bit less on the pricing and appreciate more the convenience that these models are offering us."", ""Jason Moser: We're going to wrap up our news round up with a little bit of an earnings talk. Last week on the radio show we talked about how earnings season was ramping up. We don't have a full earnings picture from Intuitive Surgical yet, but we got some preliminary results this week. Strong market reaction to the results because they looked like a pretty strong indication of the quarter."", ""Jason Moser: What we're seeing is signs that things are getting back to a state of normal. Particularly for a business like intuitive. Intuitive being right there in hospitals, in medical facilities, those were places that really witnessed a lot of tumult here over the last few years because of everything that we went through with COVID. We saw procedures put on hold, unless it's some type of life saving procedure. But elective surgery really tanked. What we're seeing now, and we're seeing this certainly through the procedure growth, things are coming back around. Procedural growth for this quarter, up 21 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Procedures matter for a company like Intuitive Surgical. One of the beauties of this business model is having that big razor in the hospital. Having that big razor in the hospital. Then selling those instruments and those accessories, the consumables that you need to actually make those machines work. When procedures go up, well then the sale of those accessories and those instruments go up as well. They've been able to witness a little pricing power on those as well, which will help their margins, of course. As painful as it's been for them over the last several years, with procedure growth being so threatened, now we're starting to see things turn, procedural growth turning back around, which really has a number of ongoing positive effects for the business."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think as we tape shares up about 6% on these preliminary results, and it's an interesting time to check in on this business because we are hitting a little bit of a COVID normalization, it seems. But also because at its current valuation, we are getting close to all time highs for this business. Again, this has been a growth story and I think a very future forward story for a long time. Do you still see a lot of runway ahead of this business?"", ""Jason Moser: I do. It is certainly a market that has become more competitive over the last several years as technology has proliferated and given other companies the opportunity to pursue this space. Their installed base is getting up there. This is something we are all in. They're closing in on 9,000 of the systems installed, whether it's Da Vinci or this new IonSystem that they have, that doesn't go on forever. Particularly when you consider the competition in this space and the stock is not conventionally cheap. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 plus times earnings right now, it garners that multiple because of it's top dog status in the space. I don't suspect that continues. We will see that growth start to slow down a little bit. We will see more competition enter into the fray there. I think naturally as time goes on, we'll see that valuation start to pull back down. Maybe at some point we start talking about intuitive like we talked about Apple making that transition from growth company to most aid dividend payer. Maybe we'll get to that point with Intuitive, but I don't think we're close to it yet."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll check in certainly along the way. Jason Moser, thanks for joining me today."", 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up. We don't talk about legal financing too much on the show because there's only one publicly traded company that does it. Motley Fool Senior analyst, Rich Greifner, caught up with Chris Bogart, CEO of Burford Capital in early December for a conversation about his company's competitive advantages in the space and a high stakes case with Argentina."", ""Rich Greifner: Let's start at the start. Can you give me Litigation Funding 101. What is it? What problem does it solve, and what role does Burford play in the process?"", ""Chris Bogart: Absolutely. Litigation finance is basically specialty finance that looks at legal assets, claims, litigation matters, arbitrations. Looks at those things as financible assets. When you think about a business, companies often have valuable claims that they're bringing. Sometimes it's against other companies, sometimes it's in the context of a multi company thing that has gone wrong. For example, companies that have been victims of price fixing. Those claims have value. You can think of them effectively as being contingent receivables. Just like any other financial asset that has value, you can organize a financing package around the value of those assets, and that's exactly what we do. Now, why is that of interest to companies in particular? There are really two parts to that answer. One part is that spending operating cash, diverting operating cash from the purpose of your business and putting it into a collateral activity like litigation isn't the most value maximizing strategy for companies to engage in. For example, I used to be the general counsel of Time Warner, the media group. Time Warner had lots of money. It wasn't a question of Time Warner not being able to pay for litigation if it wanted to bring it, but every dollar that we spent on litigation was a dollar that we didn't spend making television or movies, or publishing magazines."", ""Ultimately, it's that core business, the business of publishing and making movies that investors want us to be engaged in, that's the business on which you get multiple on your profits. Whereas being really good at collateral litigation doesn't get rewarded by investors and doesn't contribute to your market value in the same way. If you can get an alternative to paying your own operating cash for these collateral activities, whether it's litigation or something else that businesses do, that's a value. We help businesses take those costs off their PNL. We help them keep their operating cash to be devoted to the things that the core business are doing. So that's Part 1. Part 2 is especially in the world that we're in today where there is more and more litigation and that litigation can often be quite high value. These claims really do have significant future potential value. As a result, they are assets that businesses can obtain financing against today. Not only just to pay the costs of those cases, but also to generate today cash that businesses can turn around and use in their operating businesses. We do that as well. We effectively monetize the future expected value of litigation today, and we give businesses cash against those values so that they can go and grow and hire employees and increase their profitability."", 'Rich Greifner: Thank you for that overview. That explains why litigation finance, legal finance is beneficial to the corporation. How about from the law firm side? You also provide a benefit to the law firms.', ""Chris Bogart: We do because ultimately most of the law firms that we work with are law firms that have an hourly fee business model. They charge clients for their time, and law firms don't really have access to the capital markets. As you know, you can't go and buy stock in a US law firm. It's not permitted for you to do that. What that means from the law firm perspective is the only way for law firms to get capital into their business is by borrowing it from the bank. They would prefer not to do that. They would prefer another more sophisticated financial party like us to be in the market intermediating that capital. They would just like to do the business of law. They're happy to have us accommodate the desires of companies for alternative fee arrangements while at the same time not having to go and become financial institutions themselves. By the way, the investor side of that coin is that investors don't have very many good ways of getting exposure to the legal industry, and the legal industry is absolutely enormous. Globally, it's roughly the same size as the pharma industry."", ""Chris Bogart: But as an investor, there are very few ways that you can go and get direct exposure to what's going on in that large and profitable industry and Buford is one of those ways."", ""Rich Greifner: Buford, co founded in 2009, and the company has generated very consistently high returns on invested capital since that time and that suggests that you guys benefit from strong and sustainable competitive advantages. The company likes to call out four sources of competitive advantage. Your scale, your brand, your expertise, and your data. I was hoping we could just quickly touch on each of those four categories so let's start with scale. Why is scale so important in this industry?"", ""Chris Bogart: Scale is important, but all of those advantages really link together and create a pretty substantial mote for Buford. Buford is the industry leader by a very significant margin, both in terms of pure scale. In other words, the number of dollars of capital that we put out. We're sitting today with a portfolio that's north of $7 billion in size. We have more than 150 people spread around the world who do this work, many of whom are experienced former lawyers and what that does, you mentioned Goldman Sachs at the beginning of this conversation. When you look at Goldman or a Blackstone or KKR or Morgan Stanley, those firms get a certain amount of business simply because of their size, scale, and presence and we benefit from that as well. We're the known quantity in the legal industry. You'd be hard pressed today to find a partner at a major law firm who doesn't know about us and doesn't know that our capital and our services are available for their clients. Those are the competitive advantages that we've built over the last 15 years and they also lead to data. Data is a very significant competitive advantage for us that comes out of a combination of scale and longevity."", ""The reason the data is important is because litigation is inherently risky. In any piece of litigation, there is idiosyncratic risk of a court, a judge, a jury not agreeing with your position and going in the opposite direction. When that happens, you have a loss in the case and when we have a loss in the case we lose our capital. Trying to make the best quality investment decision that we possibly can is a significant part of what we do here and one of the things about litigation, of course, is that a fair bit of litigation resolves by settlement, by negotiated between parties instead of buy a case going all the way to trial. Settlements are usually confidential and so as a result, it's relatively hard just based on public data for you to get a good data set from which to make high quality investment and analytical decisions. What we have is the benefit now because again, of our scale and longevity, the largest data set in the industry, which lets us apply significant quantitative rigor to our investment process and to make use of that data to improve our performance. We're now down, for example, to a loss rate across our portfolio of only about 9% which is very low when you think of litigation being brought in large dollar cases where those cases are often pretty evenly matched."", ""Rich Greifner: For folks who aren't familiar with this industry. You mentioned this a bit. The majority of cases will settle, so about 70% of your cases settle an when a case settles, Buford typically earns attractive returns with no real litigation risk. About 8% of your cases go to trial and Buford loses and in that event, it's a near complete loss of capital. But there's about 21% of your cases that go to trial and Buford prevails and that is where the real money comes in. There you're looking to earn multi bugger returns on your initial investment. That's just an asymmetric characteristic of the industry."", ""Chris Bogart: That's exactly right, and it's just common sense when you think about it. Litigation is inherently risky and so if you have a $10 million claim, you're not going to spend $10 million in legal fees to fight that claim. You're going to spend $10 million in legal fees only if you can get to $100 million in claim value. When we lose cases, yes, it's unpleasant to lose, but we're only losing the invested capital that we put into them. The $10 million in that example, when we win, we're capable of winning the entire claim. The $100 million in that example and the settlements fill in the middle range, because settlements are an inherently outcome, because they're negotiated with the other side."", ""Rich Greifner: Yeah. The best example that we can provide of a big outlier success is your YPF case. Ordinarily, Buford doesn't reveal much information about the cases in which it invests. But this is so public and so material to your results that you guys have discussed this quite a bit. I'm hoping, can we just do a one minute overview? What is the YPF case? What's the brief history of it? Where do we stand now and what's next?"", ""Chris Bogart: YPF is a publicly traded energy company that's owned by the Argentine government. It was privatized a number of years ago. Argentina then renationalized and as it renationalized, breached its promises to shareholders to tender for their stock and YPF. As a result of that, large holders in the stock suffered financial distress because the share price collapsed. In particular, the Peterson clients went bankrupt and we were appointed by the Spanish Bankruptcy Court to try to get relief for their credit. In doing so, we brought a case on behalf of those creditors in federal court in New York. That case has gone all the way through the trial process and ultimately produced a final judgment that is now on appeal. That final judgment in the trial court was for a little bit over $16 billion. The reason that number is so high is simply because YPF was worth a lot and there is a formula for calculating that tender offer price that Argentina simply didn't pay. All the court did, ultimately, was find that both Argentina was liable and the court used the formula to calculate the tender offer price."", ""Rich Greifner: Okay. You guys have been working on this case for eight or nine years now. You mentioned Argentina is found liable for about $16 billion in damages. Of that amount, Buford is owed a bit more than 6 billion, which is more than double the company's market cap. The market is obviously skeptical about your ability to actually collect cash from Argentina. I know you probably don't want to say too much here, but is there anything you could share that might give us some insight into your ability to enforce that judgment against Argentina?"", ""Chris Bogart: Well, I think it's not so much a question of enforcing the judgment, but we do a lot of judgment enforcement around the world and one of the characteristics of enforcing judgments is that that is a process that inherently in discounts, the face value of those judgments. Even though you've got a judgment sitting there for $16 billion ultimately you'd expect that judgment to be paid through a negotiated process with Argentina and that negotiation is going to result in a discount to that face value."", ""Rich Greifner: I don't know if you can comment on this or not. Argentina has got a new president. Is there anything you can say about how that might impact your ability to collect?"", ""Chris Bogart: Well, we just to say it's obviously early days. The new president isn't even in office yet. But only to say that during the course of the presidential campaign, this judgment because of its size did come up and the government's position was Argentina needs to take care of its doubts."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buyer selling thing based solely on what you hear.

These companies are considered to be stable, reliable, and financially strong, as they have demonstrated the ability to generate consistent earnings growth and return value to shareholders through regular dividend payments. In 2023, dividend stocks became less popular despite the overall success of the three major US stock indexes, which managed to achieve double-digit returns even during regional banking challenges, high-interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Rising interest rates led investors to prefer bonds with attractive yields over riskier stocks that offered smaller dividends. The hype around artificial intelligence also drew investors towards large-cap tech stocks, causing the rest of the market to lag.', ""The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with a history of increasing dividends for the past 25 years, only saw a 5.7% increase in 2023, in contrast to the S&P 500 total return index's substantial 26% gain. This marked a shift from 2022 when the dividend index outperformed the total return index as investors sought income-generating stocks amid concerns about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes."", ""That said, dividend growth stocks have consistently demonstrated strong performance over the years. A report from ProShares highlighted the period from May 2005 to September 2023, during which the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index outperformed the broader market. Over this timeframe, the Dividend Aristocrats index delivered a total return of 10.35%, surpassing the 9.54% return of the broader market. Furthermore, when examining volatility, the Dividend Aristocrats index displayed a 15.35% volatility rate during this time frame. In comparison, the S&P 500 had slightly higher volatility at 16.31%. These figures suggest that, while both indices delivered competitive returns, the Dividend Aristocrats index managed to achieve this with slightly lower volatility, emphasizing the relative stability and resilience of dividend growth stocks in the investment landscape. The report also mentioned that from its beginning, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has secured 90% of the market's gains while enduring only 81% of its losses. This track record has significantly contributed to the sustained outperformance of the strategy over the long term."", ""While dividend growth stocks have demonstrated consistent performance over time, it's worth noting that several dividend aristocrats have lost their status for various reasons. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, from late 2008 to 2019, a total of 33 companies were removed from the Aristocrats list. This indicates that despite the overall stability of dividend growth stocks, individual companies within the category may experience changes in their dividend status due to different circumstances. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

By further expanding their digital offerings and developing new high[1]margin content partnerships, Gannett appears positioned to return to growth over the next 12-18 months. In addition, Gannett recently announced an anti-trust lawsuit against Google which follows similar actions by the European Central Bank (ECB) and various states.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This bank holding company for First Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -38.9%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $99.63 million, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

After all, everyone's situation will vary. An investing style that suits one person may not suit you.

Its stock has more than tripled in the last year alone. Among stocks with a market cap of at least $50 billion today, Nvidia has outperformed absolutely everybody over the past three, five, and 10 years. It's hard to beat this wealth-building machine these days."", ""So what's next? Let's say I scrape together a robust $20,000 Nvidia position today -- can I expect to make a million dollars on that investment?"", ""The short answer is yes, but it'll take a while and the lofty target result isn't guaranteed."", ""Looking back, Nvidia's stock chart from the past eight years is nothing short of extraordinary. Starting from a respectable $23 billion market cap in 2016, the company's strategy has shifted along with the market opportunity."", ""Nvidia's expertise in high-performance graphics cards for gaming and professional graphics turned into a crypto bonanza when enthusiasts found the same cards to be excellent for mining Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) tokens. Just as Ethereum switched to a different technology with no need for miners, OpenAI came along with its ChatGPT tool, unveiling a new dawn in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Based on the same high-end graphics platforms as the gaming and crypto surges, Nvidia's AI accelerator processors powered the back-end creation of ChatGPT's AI engine."", ""Now, lots of companies with AI-powered ambitions are buying hundreds or even thousands of extremely pricey accelerator chips and Nvidia is the first supplier that comes to mind at this point. It shows in Nvidia's spectacular financial results and the stock chart that follows:"", ""The chart above shows the return of a $20,000 investment started on May 16, 2016, resulting in a $1.0 million value nearly 8 years later. That's an average annual return of 67.4%."", ""At the end of that market-crushing chart, Nvidia is worth $1.4 trillion. The stock rose to this height the hard way, delivering top-notch products attuned to the right market opportunities at the right times. The end result is a legendary price gain with record-high investor returns. Sorting the total stock market's 10-year gains, I don't even need to limit the field with a large market-cap requirement to weed out short-lived meme stocks and other gadflies. Nvidia simply offered the strongest decade-long returns of any stock tracked by the screeners at my disposal."", ""But things are different now. It may be difficult to grow a $23 billion market cap 50-fold, but even tougher when you start with a $1.3 trillion stock-value footprint. Even if Nvidia continues to dominate the AI market, and that trend delivers on the most striking predictions for years to come, it's unrealistic to assume an average annual return of 67% for another eight-year run."", ""By the end of that rainbow, Nvidia would be worth $67.6 trillion. That's more than double the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, estimated at $26.9 billion in 2023. I'm sorry, but that's going to take a while."", ""Nvidia's past performance has set a high bar and it's important to manage your expectations for the next phase of its AI business. The exceptional gains of recent years are not likely to continue for another 8-year span. That would require not only continued success in the booming AI sector for nearly a full decade, but also sustained hypergrowth in the market itself and unshaken investor confidence in Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios. The stock trades at 72 times earnings and 30 times sales today. These overheated ratios should cool down over time, raising the needed financial support for that $67 trillion market cap in the process."", 'Of course, Nvidia could lower the bar with some accounting tricks. The company can return cash to shareholders by means of generous share buybacks and dividends.', 'Other companies have pursued this strategy before. For example, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has seen its share price fall by 2% over the last 10 years while its market cap shrunk by 14%. At the same time, Big Blue bought back 12% of its issued shares and delivered robust dividend payouts. All in all, IBM investors pocketed a respectable total return of 50% over the same period.', ""Nvidia could attempt a larger-scale version of this, boosting the returns by sharing cash profits with the company's investors. Of course, this cash-sharing idea takes away from the company's freedom to invest in future growth-boosting business plans, so there's a fine line between generosity and growth-blunting missteps."", ""And of course, anything is possible over a long enough time span. America's GDP stopped at $1.5 trillion in 1973, comparable to Nvidia's market value today. Suggesting that any single company could deserve a trillion-dollar market cap would have sounded ridiculous 50 years ago, but here we stand with 6 stocks in the trillion-dollar club. A few decades from now, that $67 trillion target might not look so silly anymore."", ""The real question is, will Nvidia still be around in 2064 or 2074, and will it dominate its chosen markets for that long? I don't think so, but anything is possible."", ""So yes, Nvidia just might be able to grow that a $20,000 investment into a cool million, but it's a long road to that ambitious target and many things can go wrong along the way. Remember, this stock delivered the richest shareholder returns of any company over the last decade, and even that stellar run barely exceeded the 50-fold gain it takes to meet that goal."", ""That being said, I'm not closing out my own Nvidia position anytime soon, though I might take advantage of its recent moonshot by diversifying some of the gains into other investment ideas. I'm still looking at a proven AI giant with a bright future, and its valuation has calmed down a bit in recent weeks. Buying Nvidia stock today makes perfect sense if you can stomach it trading at nosebleed-inducing prices. The next wave of processor orders for AI systems could make the last surge look forgettable by comparison."", ""So feel free to invest in Nvidia today. Just don't expect the incredible returns of the last 8 years to continue for another multi-year span. To make me a happy Nvidia investor, all the company needs to do is deliver stock price gains comparable to or exceeding the stock market as a whole."", 'At an annual clip of 15%, a 50-fold return would materialize after 28 years. Patience is a virtue, dear reader.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Each stock in this group -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- delivered gains of 48% or more in 2023. Nvidia more than tripled, while Meta came close to doing so.', 'However, those performances pale in comparison to what one stock has done barely over two weeks into the new year. Forget the Magnificent Seven: Longboard Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: LBPH) has nearly quadrupled in 2024 -- and Wall Street thinks it can go a lot higher.', ""It's completely understandable if you've never heard of Longboard Pharmaceuticals. At the end of 2023, its market cap was only around $144 million. That's too small to be on the radar screens for most investors."", 'However, Longboard began the new year with a bang. On Jan. 2, the company announced positive results from its Pacific phase 1b/2a clinical study evaluating the experimental drug bexicaserin in treating developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs).', 'Using the word ""positive"" doesn\'t convey just how good Longboard\'s update was. The company\'s chief medical officer, Randall Kaye, described the Pacific study results for bexicaserin as ""exciting."" Tracy Dixon-Salazar, executive director of the LGS Foundation, an organization that supports research and education related to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), used the adjective ""remarkable.""', ""In Longboard's clinical study, patients who received bexicaserin experienced a 53.3% median decrease in countable motor seizure frequency compared to a 20.8% decrease for those receiving placebo. Patients with Dravet syndrome, a genetic form of epilepsy, experienced a 72.1% median decline in countable motor seizure frequency. Patients with LGS experienced a median seizure reduction of 48.1%, while patients with other types of DEE experienced a reduction of 61.2%."", ""What's more, bexicaserin's safety profile looked encouraging. Nearly 86% of patients who received Longboard's experimental drug tolerated the highest dose of 12 milligrams. Nine patients in the bexicaserin group dropped out of the study due to adverse events, but two of those did so during the maintenance period. All participants who completed the study chose to enroll in Longboard's ongoing 52-week open-label extension study."", 'CEO Kevin R. Lind said in the press release announcing the results earlier this year that the company is ramping up to advance bexicaserin into late-stage testing. It is making preparations at the same time as it further evaluates the full data from the Pacific study.', 'Lind said that he and the rest of Longboard\'s team ""believe that bexicaserin provides us with the cornerstone to build a world-class epilepsy franchise and to explore development paths forward that may offer novel options to DEE patients that are vastly underserved."" Kaye proclaimed that bexicaserin ""has the potential to redefine the standard of care in DEEs.""', 'This optimism could be warranted. Only four DEEs currently have approved therapies, leaving more than 20 types of DEE with no approved therapy. Importantly, the number of patients with these other DEEs could be greater than the combined number of patients with the four types of DEE with approved therapies. Bexicaserin also appears to be competitive in seizure reduction with the leading approved therapies for Dravet syndrome and LGS.', 'Longboard should be in a good position financially to fund its late-stage study. The company quickly moved to issue new shares after its stock surged. It raised gross proceeds of around $241.5 million from this public offering.', ""Even after the stock's tremendous gain this year, Wall Street remains bullish. All seven of the analysts recently surveyed by LSEG rated the stock as a buy or a strong buy."", ""What's even more impressive is just how high analysts think Longboard's share price can go. The average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of nearly 77%. The most pessimistic price target for the stock is 28% above the current share price."", 'Longboard Pharmaceuticals has clearly outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven stocks early in 2024. It also has broader enthusiastic support on Wall Street than those much larger stocks have as well.', ""However, this doesn't necessarily make it a better pick than all of the Magnificent Seven. Clinical-stage biotech stocks are inherently risky. It's possible that the late-stage clinical study for bexicaserin won't be as successful as the Pacific study."", ""More importantly, Longboard might not be able to deliver the long-term returns that stocks such as Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and the others will. Those giants are already highly profitable and have multiple growth drivers. All of Longboard's fortunes, for now, hinge on bexicaserin and one other pipeline candidate, LP659."", ""But investors seeking a truly explosive stock that could still have plenty of room to run over the short term could find Longboard Pharmaceuticals quite attractive. You might even say that it's a magnificent stock to consider."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Longboard Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Longboard Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Longboard Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 States with the Cheapest Home Insurance in the US.', ""Home insurance covers damages to one's home in case of a natural disaster such as a storm, hurricane, wildfire, or an injury on the property. The home insurance cost differs depending on numerous factors such as the location, square footage, and the age of the house. Typically, a home insurance policy provides dwelling coverage for rebuilding or repairing, personal property coverage, as well as liability coverage against accidents caused to others. Most frequently, damages related to earthquakes and floods are excluded from home insurance policies."", 'The United States remains vulnerable to natural calamities including wildfires, floods, tornadoes, and storms. On September 13, 2023, Reuters reported that the 23 disasters that had hit the US in 2023 have cost $57.9 billion in damages. 253 fatalities took place during these disasters. Outdated building codes that do not cater to the current climate dynamics also expose many Americans to the damage that could be caused during a potential disaster. Furthermore, rising labor costs, construction costs, and material costs for rebuilding led to higher home insurance costs in 2023. The country has seen a rise in property replacement costs as well. These conditions have been prevailing in the industry as home insurance premiums soared from 2022 to 2023, on average.\xa0', 'The American home insurance market has witnessed higher claims due to a surge in climate-related disasters. In order to mitigate this risk, home insurers have increased insurance rates. This has resulted in higher premiums, especially in states which have a higher risk of these disasters. This is because home insurers in these places tend to pay out high amounts in claims related to natural disasters. Hence, climate change poses a serious threat to the industry. A prime example of a US state being affected by natural disasters is Florida. The high risk of hurricanes and flooding in the state has impacted its home insurance market. Many home insurers have left the market or have been driven out of business since offering policies has become way too costly. Climate change does not only affect the companies since homeowners also find home insurance policies relatively difficult to afford in such circumstances. Increasing construction of homes in disaster-prone areas in America also tends to be an issue.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TRV in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $5.07 per share for TRV, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.99 per share.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Walt Disney, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.053 = US$9.3b ÷ (US$206b - US$31b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Walt Disney has an ROCE of 5.3%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Entertainment industry average of 9.6%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Walt Disney compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Walt Disney here  for free."", ""In terms of Walt Disney's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 5.3% from 18% five years ago. However it looks like Walt Disney might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""To conclude, we've found that Walt Disney is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 15% in the last five years. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere."", ""One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Walt Disney and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""We know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, McDonald's' TSR for the last 5 years was 77%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""McDonald's shareholders gained a total return of 8.6% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 12% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with McDonald's ."", ""We will like McDonald's better if we see some big insider buys.

In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this REIT delivered a surprise of 3.17% in terms of core funds from operations (FFO) per share. The results reflected healthy rent growth.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on all occasions, the average beat being 3.85%. This is depicted in the graph below:"", 'Prologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. Quote', 'Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.', 'Per a Cushman & Wakefield CWK report, the U.S. industrial real estate market ended 2023 with absorption totals and vacancy rates returning to levels reminiscent of the pre-pandemic era. Following two record years, a combination of high interest rates, a normalization of demand, and record-setting construction delivery totals played a role in rebalancing markets.The pace of quarterly construction deliveries remained brisk, with the completion of an additional 156.3 million square feet (msf) of industrial facilities in the fourth quarter of 2023. It marked the second-highest quarterly total on record, trailing only behind the 173.2 msf delivered in the previous quarter.Overall net absorption came in at 41.1 msf in the fourth quarter, down marginally from the previous quarter. However, it pushed the annual total to 224.3 msf, on par with the 10-year pre-pandemic average of 224.8 msf.Vacancy rates climbed above 5% for the first time in three years, with new supply being the key driver. It reached 5.2% in the fourth quarter and represented a 70-basis point increase. However, occupancy still remains tight historically, with the vacancy rate remaining 180 bps lower than the 10-year pre-pandemic historical average of 7%.Though asking rents moved up, its growth rate decelerated amid market conditions softening with rising vacancy rates and normalizing leasing totals. Asking rents inched higher to $9.79 per square foot, but the 0.5% quarterly rise is well lower than the growth rates achieved since the start of 2021 (3.8% per quarter). Moreover, on an annual basis, rental rate growth reached 10% at year-end 2023.At the same time, amid the overall economic uncertainty, a tough lending environment and the continuing slowdown in demand, there is a pullback in construction starts. For the first time since mid-year 2021, the volume of space under construction plunged below the 500-msf mark, standing at 452.6 msf at the close of 2023, down 33.7% year over year.', 'Given Prologis’ capacity to offer high-quality facilities in key markets, it is well-poised to navigate through the current softening of the industrial real estate market. With its differentiated customer offerings and strategic investments in the to-be-reported quarter, the REIT is still likely to have experienced healthy rent and occupancy levels compared to its peers.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In June 2023, it concluded the buyout of nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced Prologis’ presence in the key U.S. markets, poising it well for long-term growth.Moreover, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $238 million in the nine months that ended Sep 30, 2023. Development stabilization aggregated $1.92 billion, while development starts totaled $1.35 billion.In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Prologis has a robust balance sheet that empowers its expansion moves. As a dominant player in the industrial REIT sector, it can secure capital at advantageous rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.78 billion, suggesting a nearly 12.19% year-over-year jump.We project a 10.8% increase in rental revenues in the fourth quarter to $1.76 million. Our estimate for fourth-quarter average occupancy is 97.3%, implying a 20-basis point increase from the prior quarter. However, the same-store net operating income is expected to decrease 0.9%.Prologis’ activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share has been unrevised at $1.26 in the past month. However, it suggests a 1.61% increase year over year.For the full year 2023, Prologis expected core FFO per share in the range of $5.58-$5.60. The company estimated cash same-store NOI (Prologis share) between 9.75% and 10.00% and average occupancy in the range of 97.25-97.50%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unrevised at $5.60 over the past month. The figure indicates an 8.53% increase year over year on revenues of $6.85 billion.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Prologis this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.Prologis currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.10%.

The launch heralds unparalleled areal densities of 3TB+ per platter—and a roadmap that will achieve 4TB+ and 5TB+ per platter in the coming years.', 'The Mozaic 3+ platform powers Seagate’s flagship Exos® product family, with newly announced, industry-leading capacity points of 30TB and beyond. Exos 30TB+ products are shipping in volume this quarter to hyperscale cloud customers.', 'Seagate’s areal density innovation—which increases the number of bits that can be stored on a platter—addresses common industry pain points. Mozaic 3+ enables customers to store more data in the same floor space than ever before. Upgrading from a 16TB conventional perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) drive (the average capacity in large-scale data centers) to an Exos 30TB Mozaic 3+ technology drive effectively doubles capacity in the same footprint.', 'The platform uses roughly the same material components as PMR hard drives while dramatically increasing capacity, allowing data centers to significantly lower storage acquisition and operational costs—including a 40% improvement in per terabyte power consumption. Mozaic 3+ can also help customers achieve sustainability goals—a top priority for large-scale data centers—by offering a 55% reduction in embodied carbon per terabyte (when comparing a 30TB Mozaic 3+ drive with a traditional 16TB PMR drive).', 'Seagate is experiencing strong demand from data center customers that are expected to complete qualification of Mozaic 3+ and move into volume ramp by end of this quarter. A leading cloud service provider is focused on ramping of Seagate-provided drives to Mozaic 3+, reflecting their confidence in the technology.', '""Seagate is the world’s only hard drive manufacturer with the areal density capability to get to 3TB per platter and with 5TB on the horizon,"" said Dave Mosley, Seagate’s CEO. ""As AI use cases put a premium on raw data sets, more companies are going to need to store all the data they can. To accommodate the resulting masses of data, areal density matters more than ever.""', '""The Mozaic 3+ platform represents more than just HAMR technology,"" Mosley noted. ""It comprises several industry-first innovations that we’ve integrated to help us scale areal density.""', 'Here are a few highlights:', '1. Superlattice Platinum-Alloy Media. Fundamental physics of higher-density recording requires smaller media grain size at nanoscale. The challenge here is that smaller grains are more unstable. Legacy alloys do not provide sufficient magnetic stability for effective and reliable storage. In Mozaic 3+ hard drives, the media alloy uses a pioneering iron-platinum superlattice structure, which significantly increases the magnetic coercivity of disk media. This allows for precise data writing and unprecedented bit stability.', '2. Plasmonic Writer. Since the media are made magnetically ""harder"" to prevent instability, the design requires a revolutionary writer—a marvel of miniaturization and precision engineering that is Seagate’s unique implementation of HAMR. Anchoring this technology is a nanophotonic laser, which produces an infinitesimal heat spot on the media surface to reliably write the data.', 'Seagate plans to vertically integrate the nanophotonic laser into the plasmonic writer sub-system. ""Developing this unique laser technology in-house for Mozaic 3+ will ensure even greater efficiency and yield to support rapid scaling of volume production,"" Mosley said.', ""3. Gen 7 Spintronic Reader. Smaller grains of written data are only useful if they can be read. Integrated along with the sub-components of the plasmonic writer, the reader also needed to evolve. Incorporating quantum technology, Mozaic 3+ includes one of the world's smallest and most sensitive magnetic field reading sensors."", '4. 12nm Integrated Controller. Efficiently orchestrating all this technology called for an integrated controller, a system-on-a-chip, developed entirely in house. This sophisticated application-specific integrated circuit delivers up to 3 times the performance compared to prior solutions.', '""Hard drive areal density improvements are critical for economically and efficiently expanding the installed base of hard drive-based mass storage, especially in data centers,"" said John Rydning, Research Vice President, IDC Global DataSphere. ""Seagate’s innovative areal density breakthrough is timely and will enable it to deliver increasingly higher capacity hard drive products for many years.""', 'In addition to data centers, Mozaic 3+ storage technology will enable a wide range of use cases, ranging from enterprise, to edge, NAS, and video and imaging applications (VIA) markets.', 'To learn more about Mozaic 3+ technologies and products, visit this page.

First, there was United Parcel Service, which said in early December that it was eliminating the CMO role. One week later, arts and crafts marketplaceEtsy said it would do the same by merging CMO responsibilities under its operations chief. Directly before the new year, it was Walgreens' turn to bid adieu to its CMO, distributing the job's functions to other senior leaders."", ""One commonality between the three companies is that they have each hit a bumpy financial patch and are under pressure to cut costs. UPS's revenue fell 13% last quarter, while Etsy's once robust growth engine has sputtered. Meanwhile, Walgreens is in the midst of enormous C-suite turnover. But these companies' elimination of a standalone CMO role makes them just the latest in a long line of big corporations to make the same cut in the last few years. Among them are Lowe's, Hyatt Hotels, McDonald's, Johnson & Johnson, Uber, and Lyft."", ""It's not that CMOs are going the way of the dodo, but rather that their total share is shrinking.

According to executive search firm Spencer Stuart, 71% of the Fortune 500 has a marketing chief, though it's down from 74% in 2009."", 'The data gleaned from modern marketing and all its many touch points with customers, fueled by the rise of marketing technology or ""martech,"" is far richer than anything companies have seen before. Historically, CMOs dealt with marketing and advertising like those in print and on TV. But tech has digitized the role, transforming it into one that is more algorithmically driven, full of customer insights, and so mission critical that it also falls under other C-suite executives\' remit.', '""Today, an executive has to be much more of a generalist,"" says Stephan Meier, a professor of management at Columbia Business School.', 'Take UPS as an example; Matt Guffey was head of its global strategy and transformation.

In contrast, over 70% of Fortune 100 CEOs have operations or finance backgrounds, the surer pathways to the corner office. What's more, only 41 of Fortune 1000 companies have a marketer on their board. Naturally, those that do are primarily consumer-focused brands like Best Buy, Mattel, Nike, Estée Lauder and Crocs."", 'Still, Richard Sanderson, who leads\xa0Spencer Stuart\'s\xa0North America marketing, sales and communications officer practice stresses that marketing is as necessary as ever, arguably more so, as evidenced by the absorption of the job\'s tasks into operational and growth-focused roles. ""When people say, \'Oh, the CMO role is being eliminated,\' that doesn\'t mean marketing isn\'t important. It simply means a company has chosen to structure around the role in a different way,"" he says.', ""Plus, the role can still be a viable pathway to the corner office, particularly at consumer-facing companies: Ulta Beauty's David Kimbell and Vail Resorts' Kirsten Lynch were their respective company's marketing chiefs before ascending to the top job."", ""Some companies that previously eliminated the CMO title have also had a change of heart. After McDonald's did away with its\xa0global CMO role in 2019, the burger company\xa0reinstated it less than a year later. Not only that, but in early January, McDonald's\xa0added new business ventures\xa0to the portfolio of its now-CMO, Morgan Flatley.

You'll notice that they all:"", 'Grow for decades (even if they occasionally hit setbacks).', 'Sell things consumers buy repeatedly.', 'Have colossal market opportunities.', 'Here are five Buffett stocks you can buy and hold without losing sleep.', ""Naturally, Berkshire's largest holding kicks this list off. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is 47% of the portfolio.

He bought his first shares in 2019, a position that's just 0.4% of Berkshire's holdings."", ""However, there is still a lot to be excited about with Amazon.

It's not good for you, but people have been drinking to alleviate stress and have a good time for thousands of years."", ""It's not a massive investment by Buffett's standards. Berkshire allocates just $32 million to Diageo stock, making it a rounding error in Berkshire's portfolio.

Credit cards are a bedrock in consumers' household finances. Credit card debt across America totals more than $1 trillion today."", ""That will not change anytime soon, and American Express should remain a household brand name.

RPM is benefiting from the efficient execution of its MAP 2025 initiatives aimed at expanding the gross margin and fueling adjusted EBIT growth. Furthermore, increased infrastructure demand, especially in international markets, and the company’s focus on its repair and maintenance business improve the growth prospects to a great extent.Thanks to the positive factors, shares of this manufacturer and marketer of specialty coatings, sealants and building materials have gained 16.5% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry’s 13.4% growth.Although the company’s earnings estimate for fiscal 2024 has remained unchanged in the past 60 days at $5 per share, it showcases a growth rate of 16.3% from $4.30 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, the earnings growth rate of third-quarter fiscal 2024 is 32.4% year over year. The growth prospect is solidified with a VGM Score of A, backed by a Momentum Score of A and a Growth Score of A. The positive trend signifies bullish analysts’ sentiments, robust fundamentals and prospects of an outperformance in the near term.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, the aforementioned tailwinds are partially offset by a decline in sales in two out of four of RPM’s segments, along with increased expenses. These headwinds are likely to negatively impact this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth prospects to some extent.', 'MAP 2025 Initiatives: This operational improvement initiative was unveiled by RPM in August 2022 and aimed to maximize operational efficiencies and generate superior value for its customers, associates and shareholders through 2025.During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company witnessed softness in certain end markets, despite which it could expand its margins in the quarter attributable to the efficient implementation of the MAP 2025 plan. In the quarter, the company primarily witnessed margin expansion in the Construction Products Group (CPG) and the Performance Coatings Group (PCG), wherein both generated higher volumes. Also, a record cash flow of $408.6 million was generated from operating activities during the quarter.RPM intends to focus on the MAP 2025 initiative through 2024 as it believes there is still scope for improvement.Strong Infrastructure Demand: RPM has been witnessing increased infrastructure demand from its global markets for some time now. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, sales volume growth was witnessed in businesses providing engineered solutions targeting infrastructure, reshoring and high-performance building projects. This uptrend was primarily backed by strong sales growth in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia/Pacific.During the quarter, year-over-year sales in Africa, the Middle East and other foreign grew 13%, Latin America increased 21.7%, Europe sales grew 8.9% and Asia/Pacific rose 6.4%. These regions benefited from improved coordination under the Performance Coatings segment’s management, wherein the segment witnessed growth because of infrastructure and capital spending.Focus on Repair & Maintenance Business: RPM positions itself strong in an uncertain economic scenario by focusing on its repair and maintenance business. In many a case, the sales trend may be soft, thus directly impacting the top line. In such scenarios, this business helps uplift the top line and maintains growth trends of the company.During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the strategic balance maintained by RPM through the mix of repair & maintenance, along with its entrepreneurial spirit, aided the sustainable dividend growth. The CPG and PCG segments of the company also benefited from the repair and maintenance business, given the improving trends of the economy.', 'Flat Year-Over-Year Sales Trend: In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, RPM witnessed soft demand from specialty original equipment manufacturer (OEM) end markets, particularly those with exposure to residential housing and reduced consumer purchases in do-it-yourself (DIY) segments at retail outlets. This more than offset the sales volume growth from the increased infrastructure demand during the quarter, resulting in flat sales growth, year over year. This downtrend is witnessed by the lower contributions of the company’s Specialty Products Group and Consumer Group segments.Along with softness in DIY and specialty OEM markets, sales were negatively impacted by divestitures. The quarter’s sales included a 0.3% organic decline and a 0.2% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions.High Expense Scenario: RPM’s business has been witnessing higher costs and expenses related to restructuring, divestitures and labor inflation. Also, persistent supply-chain disruptions and acquisitions-related expenses are raising concerns. During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the company’s selling, general and administrative expenses increased because of investments made for long-term growth initiatives, and increased incentives to sell higher margin products and services. This was accompanied by inflation in compensation, benefits and healthcare expenses.The company expects to complete most MAP 2025 activities by the end of fiscal 2025, with an estimated $31.8 million (priorly expected $12.1 million) in additional future expenditures related to MAP 2025 implementation, thanks to increases in expected severance and benefit charges of $1 million, and expected facility closure accompanied by other related costs of $15.5 million.', 'Here are some better-ranked stocks from the Construction sector.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!"", ""Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' See our latest analysis for PPL ', ""As PPL operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$26.8, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$1.1 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$20.4', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PPL as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Weakness', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.', 'Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Dividends are not covered by earnings.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

Moreover, management said that its net sales for the holiday shopping season were up 15.6% from last year, which is strong growth as well."", ""In short, the future looks bright for Five Below.

Indeed, consumer-packaged food/beverage stocks — like POST, MDLZ, and CELH, all of which are Strong-Buy-rated stocks — tend to fare well, not only in times of recession but also in times of subtle economic prosperity.', 'Therefore, in this piece, we’ll use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to have a look at three impressive consumer-packaged food stocks that Wall Street thinks have what it takes to deliver solid results in 2024.', 'Mondelez is the confectionary kingpin that was quick to recover from the GLP-1 (weight loss drugs) sell-off encountered just a few months ago. Shares are up almost 20% from their October 2023 lows, which is pretty incredible for a low-tech firm in the consumer-packaged goods scene. Moving ahead, the Oreo maker has the means to jolt growth via various endeavors, including driving operational efficiencies. Nevertheless, even with promising earnings drivers, I’m taking a neutral stance on the name.', 'Despite Mondelez’s many growth levers and solid management team, one can’t help but wonder what the GLP-1 headwind could do to the comfort food firms. The swift recovery suggests GLP-1 drugs (like Ozempic) aren’t much to worry about. Though I view the GLP-1 sell-off as overdone, given recent shortages, what happens if such drugs become more widely available over the coming years?', 'Only time will tell, but the threat of GLP-1 drugs is not yet over. It’s an overhang that investors should keep tabs on through 2024 and 2025. We don’t know the true impact of weight-loss drugs, but there’s a chance that demand for comfort foods could really begin to take a hit in 2025 as GLP-1 shortages resolve.', 'Mondelez stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MDLZ stock price target\xa0of $80.89 implies 11.04% upside potential.', 'Post Holdings is a rather snore-worthy consumer-packaged-goods company that’s gone flat over the past year (down around 2%). Despite the lack of momentum, investors shouldn’t ignore the company’s dominance of the middle aisle of the grocery store and its gradual shift diversification from cereals to other product categories (think pet food and healthier packaged goods). Indeed, Post has robust brands that now span beyond the cereal aisle.', 'Over the years, Post has added to its brand portfolio via acquisitions. Looking ahead, I expect the firm to keep making deals at the pace of one to three per year. Given Post’s knack for growing via acquisitions, I can’t help but be bullish on the stock going into 2024.', 'Since the pandemic began, Post has been on quite the acquisition spree, gobbling up the Peter Pan peanut butter and Egg Beaters brands, just to name a few. Though the pace of deals has since slowed, one can’t help but think another brand deal could be on the horizon as the firm improves its cash position.', 'Kicking off the new year, Mizuho Securities’ John Baumgartner gave POST stock a Buy rating and a $110.00 price target (18.4% upside from here). He’s a fan of the firm’s management team and their ability to “maximize optionality of assets and capital.” I couldn’t agree more with Mr. Baumgartner.', 'A huge reason why Post’s acquisition strategy has been a success is because of management’s abilities. Had it been any other firm making such deals, I’m not so sure M&A would have been an effective way to move the needle higher on the share price.', 'At 19.3 times trailing price-to-earnings, value investors may wish to add some POST stock to their cereal bowls while they’re still trading at a slight discount to the packaged food industry average of 20.2 times.', 'Post stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average POST stock price target\xa0of $104.63 implies 12.6% upside potential.', 'Celsius Holdings is behind the hyped (and energized) drink sensation that’s taken the energy beverage world by storm. Though Celsius isn’t a tech-leveraging disruptor in AI, it’s found a way to disrupt the drink scene with some clever moves, including partnering up with an industry heavyweight in Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP).', 'Teaming up with the major player to leverage its expertise (and infrastructure) has really paid off. At writing, CELH stock is up around 60% over the past year alone. Up ahead, I expect more gains to come as Wall Street continues to stand by the hot and disruptive emerging brand.', 'As Celsius’ brand continues to build affinity among younger consumers, count me as unsurprised if the firm ends up being acquired by a juggernaut worth $100 billion or more. Immediately, Pepsi comes to mind as a candidate to buy Celsius. It is a trusted partner, after all. Also, Pepsi really needs a caffeine jolt to wake up its stock. In any case, I view Celsius as a sought-after gem on its own or in the hands of an industry giant.', 'Celsius has been steadily gaining both market share and brand affinity at an enviable rate in recent quarters. And going into 2024, I don’t expect much to derail such trends, even if a recession takes a bite out of the American economy.', 'Celsius stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average CELH stock price target\xa0of $72.25 implies 20.5% upside potential.', 'Food stocks could prove to be great bets in 2024, especially if a recession finally shows itself, punishing more cyclical areas of the market.

This volatility is expected to remain an important factor for oil and gas stocks in the coming months, even as the energy industry as a whole benefits from sector-level tailwinds.', 'This is the thesis presented in a recent note from TD Cowen, which assesses the exploration and production (E&P) stocks in the sector for the upcoming year.', '“2024 may prove to be a pivotal year as several external forces such as geopolitical risks and macroeconomic factors could play a part in the story of oil, though near-term we see domestic shale players high grading portfolios and returning to maintenance production programs in an attempt to sustain capital efficiency,” opined TD Cowen’s E&P team.', 'Against this backdrop, the TD Cowen analysts have followed up by selecting several energy stocks for investors to monitor as the 4Q23 earnings season unfolds. Let’s explore what sets these names apart from the rest of the pack. With some assistance from the TipRanks database, we can also see what the rest of the Street currently thinks about these names.', 'Diamondback Energy (FANG)', 'We’ll start with a company that boasts one of the coolest tickers on the NASDAQ, Diamondback Energy. This large-cap, independent E&P firm is based in Midland, Texas, and works the Texas oil fields – the company’s activities focus on the ‘acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation’ of various oil and natural gas assets in famous Permian Basin located in West Texas. Diamondback specializes in working unconventional onshore assets, working through horizontal drilling and tapping multiple intervals in its targeted hydrocarbon formations.', 'The Permian formation is the largest oil-producing region in the US, and in the last decade or so it put Texas back on the world’s map of high-production energy powerhouses. The region owes its resurgence to the technologies that Diamondback works with – horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which allow E&P companies to unlock known oil and gas reserves that had previously been thought unreachable. The area is a rich environment for the energy industry, and is estimated to contain up to 100 billion barrels of technically recoverable crude oil, along with 229 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.', 'As for Diamondback’s position, the company finished 2022, the most recent full-year with available data, with proved reserves of 2,033 Mmboe (million barrels of oil equivalent). Of this total, 53% was recoverable crude oil. The company’s average production through the year 2022 came to 386 Mboe/d (thousand barrels per day).', 'For return-minded investors, Diamondback pays out a regular dividend, and in the last two years has supplemented the regular payment with a variable dividend. In the last declaration, made in November 2023, the company set the regular payment at 84 cents per common share and the variable at $2.53 per share; these were paid out on November 24. The regular dividend gives a yield of 2.2%, while the combined regular+variable payment yields nearly 8.8%.', 'When we look at Diamondback’s last quarterly release, from 3Q23, we find that the company’s average daily production was up to 452.8 Mboe/d. The company generated $2.34 billion in total revenue for the quarter, a total that was down by $100 million year-over-year but beat the forecast by over $140 million. The firm’s bottom line, the adjusted net income, came to $990 million; this gave an adj. EPS of $5.49, beating the forecast by 50 cents per share.', 'Turning to the Cowen outlook, we check in with analyst David Deckelbaum, who is bullish on Diamondback, describing the company as productive and disciplined: “As the curtain of consolidation casts itself over Permian operators, FANG emerges as a continued beneficiary of scarcity value outperforming a majority of public peers. We maintain our view that FANG is one of the best plays within the broader Permian basin moving into FY24 and anticipate the name easily maintaining robust production volumes while displaying significant capital discipline.”', 'Deckelbaum goes on to rate this stock as Outperform (Buy), with a price target of $177 to suggest a one-year upside potential of 15%. (To watch Deckelbaum’s track record, click here)', 'The Strong Buy consensus rating on this stock is based on 18 recent analyst reviews, that break down to 16 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $153.84 and have an average price target of $183.11, implying a gain of 19% for the coming year. (See Diamondback stock forecast)', 'Ovintiv (OVV)', 'The second Cowen pick we’ll look at is Ovintiv, a company with a $11.3 billion market cap. This firm works in the North American E&P segment, on a ‘multi-basin’ approach – rather than focus on one high-output region, Ovintiv has staked positions in several world-class production basins on the North American continent. These include Permian and Anadarko basin formations of Texas and Oklahoma, and the Montney formation on the border between the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.', 'Ovintiv’s approach has brought the company success, and at the end of 2022 the firm had solid reserves, counting both oil and natural gas, of 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This figure included 50% liquids, and of the total, 57% was classed as ‘proved developed,’ meaning the company is already tapping into it. Based on Ovintiv’s proven reserves, the company had a reserve life index at the end of 2022 of 12.2 years.', 'We’re getting toward the end of 2023, and Ovintiv is expected to release last year’s numbers during February. In the meantime, we can look at the 3Q23 data to get an idea of where the firm stands.', 'The company’s production total came to 572 Mboe/d, which broke down to 214,000 barrels of oil per day; 87,000 barrels of natural gas liquids; and 1,625 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company raised its production forecast for 2023 to the range of 550,000 to 560,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the company’s production was good, it brought the company below-expected earnings. Ovintiv’s bottom line print came to $1.47 per share, in GAAP measures, 27 cents per share below the forecast.', 'Nevertheless, Cowen’s Gabe Daoud sees Ovintiv in position to maintain performance in 2024 after a strong finish for 2023. He writes of the company, “With the upcoming print, the ’24 guide will capture the most interest given investor expectations of an improved outlook (200kbd in oil + condensate likely raised with capex likely tightened to $2.3b at the midpoint). We expect OVV to end ’23 strong as we see oil + condensate at 226kbd, towards the high end of 4Q guidance on the back of 51 Permian TILs, ~16 in the Montney, 11 in the Uinta, and 4.4 in the Anadarko. A stepdown in production is expected in 1Q24 given the acceleration in 2H23 TILs keeping the company on track for an earlier landing to ~200kbd by 2Q24. We again note, however, that the 200kbd steady state level is likely biased higher owing to Permian productivity gains. All-in we model 208 kbd for FY24, though clearer messaging around the ‘above 200 kbd’ is expected with this print.”', 'These comments support Daoud’s Outperform (Buy) rating on OVV, while his price target, now set at $55, points toward a one-year gain of 32% for the shares. (To watch Daoud’s track record, click here)', 'Once again, we are looking at a stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. OVV shares have 11 recent reviews, including 9 to Buy against 2 to Hold. The shares’ average price target of $56.45 implies a one-year potential upside of 36% from the current $41.58 trading price. (See Ovintiv stock forecast)', 'Occidental Petroleum (OXY)', 'Wrapping up our list, we’ll look at Occidental Petroleum, a $50 billion player in the American oil industry. Occidental has major holdings in the US, in the Middle East, and in North Africa; the company’s US E&P activities include work in the Permian and DJ basins of Texas and Colorado, as well as offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. The company finished 2022 with 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves, for a y/y increase of 8.5%.', 'This company has had some unfortunate news exposure recently, as its Gulf of Mexico production activities were forced to shut down after an oil spill. According to news reports at the time, a subsea pipeline ruptured, causing large quantities of oil to leak into the surrounding waters. Occidental and several other companies use this pipeline to move crude oil to shore; the loss impacts approximately 15% of Occidental’s total American production volume.', 'That volume remains substantial, however. As of the end of 3Q23, Occidental’s 2023 year-to-date total production volume from American sources, for both oil and gas, came to 1,000 Mboe/d. The company had an additional 219 Mboe/d in international production.', 'On a positive note, Occidental in December announced that it will be purchasing CrownRock, a Midland, Texas-based oil and gas producer. The acquisition will provide a strong addition to Occidental’s onshore portfolio, particularly in the Midland Basin. The company expects to see 170 Mboe/d in additional production in 2024 from this acquisition.', 'Occidental’s last quarterly release was for 3Q23, and the company showed a total of $7.4 billion in quarterly revenue. While down 22% y/y, this revenue figure beat the forecast by $440 million. The company’s bottom line came to $1.18 per diluted share by non-GAAP measures, or 32 cents per share better than had been expected.', 'Checking in again with Cowen’s Deckelbaum, we find the analyst upbeat on Occidental’s ability to recover from the Gulf spill, saying of the firm’s prospects, “In spite of a production halt in the GOM since mid-November, we believe OXY will clip the low end of its total production guidance range to 1,206 MBOED. Our model suggests that based on cumulative productivity improvements ~9% in the Delaware OXY will produce near the high end of their 571 to 591 MBOED Permian production guidance at 589 MBOED despite weather delays in early October.”', 'Deckelbaum goes on to explain how this stock will generate returns for investors, adding to his comments above, “Even with higher opex, we still see OXY generating over $1bn in pre-dividend FCF. During 3Q reporting, OXY alluded to leaning off the throttle of preferred redemptions until 1H24. We would expect OXY to continue their $0.18/share base dividend and continue to repurchase shares as they had already completed ~60% of their second $3bn buyback authorization by 3Q.”', 'At the bottom line, the analyst gives OXY shares an Outperform (Buy) rating, with a $70 price target implying an upside potential of 20.5% in the next 12 months.', 'Overall, Occidental’s 17 recent reviews, with 7 Buys to 10 Holds, give the shares a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is trading for $58.06 and its $69.13 average price target suggests a gain of 19% on the one-year horizon.

The gene-editing therapy could reach peak annual sales of $3.9 billion, according to Goldman Sachs.', ""Third, the company has two other promising drugs in pivotal clinical testing. Vertex hopes to move forward soon with regulatory filings for VX-548 in treating acute pain. The drug doesn't have the side effects and addictive qualities of opioids. The big biotech is also advancing inaxaplin into a late-stage clinical trial in the first quarter of 2024. The drug targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease, an indication that affects more patients than CF and has no approved therapy that treats the disease's underlying cause."", ""While those are Vertex's major potential growth drivers for now, it could have others in the not-too-distant future.

Additional ATCs will be activated in the coming weeks and a complete list of ATCs can be accessed at CASGEVY.com.', 'About Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia (TDT)', 'TDT is a serious, life-threatening genetic disease. TDT patients report health-related quality of life scores below the general population and the lifetime health care costs in the U.S. of managing TDT are estimated between $5 and $5.7 million. TDT requires frequent blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy throughout a person’s life. Due to anemia, patients living with TDT may experience fatigue and shortness of breath, and infants may develop failure to thrive, jaundice and feeding problems. Complications of TDT can also include an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. TDT requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In the U.S., the median age of death for patients living with TDT is 37 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of people living with TDT because of the lack of available donors.', 'About CASGEVY™ (exagamglogene autotemcel [exa-cel])', 'CASGEVY™ is a non-viral, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy for eligible patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are edited at the erythroid specific enhancer region of the BCL11A gene through a precise double-strand break. This edit results in the production of high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. CASGEVY has been shown to reduce or eliminate VOCs for patients with SCD and transfusion requirements for patients with TDT.', 'CASGEVY is approved for certain indications in multiple jurisdictions for eligible patients.', 'Helping Patients on the CASGEVY Journey', 'Vertex Connects™ is a program for eligible patients in the U.S. who have been prescribed CASGEVY.

Having more HbF increases overall hemoglobin levels and has been shown to improve the production and function of red blood cells. This can eliminate VOCs in people with sickle cell disease and eliminate the need for regular blood transfusions in people with beta thalassemia.', 'IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION', 'What is the most important information I should know about CASGEVY?', 'After treatment with CASGEVY, you will have fewer blood cells for a while until CASGEVY takes hold (engrafts) into your bone marrow. This includes low levels of platelets (cells that usually help the blood to clot) and white blood cells (cells that usually fight infections).

Talk to your physician regarding those possible side effects. Your healthcare provider may give you other medicines to treat your side effects.', 'How will I receive CASGEVY?', 'Your healthcare provider will give you other medicines, including a conditioning medicine, as part of your treatment with CASGEVY. It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of all medicines involved in your treatment.', 'After receiving the conditioning medicine, it may not be possible for you to become pregnant or father a child. You should discuss options for fertility preservation with your healthcare provider before treatment.', 'STEP 1: Before CASGEVY treatment, a doctor will give you mobilization medicine(s). This medicine moves blood stem cells from your bone marrow into the blood stream. The blood stem cells are then collected in a machine that separates the different blood cells (this is called apheresis). This entire process may happen more than once. Each time, it can take up to one week.', 'During this step rescue cells are also collected and stored at the hospital. These are your existing blood stem cells and are kept untreated just in case there is a problem in the treatment process. If CASGEVY cannot be given after the conditioning medicine, or if the modified blood stem cells do not take hold (engraft) in the body, these rescue cells will be given back to you. If you are given rescue cells, you will not have any treatment benefit from CASGEVY.', 'STEP 2: After they are collected, your blood stem cells will be sent to the manufacturing site where they are used to make CASGEVY. It may take up to 6 months from the time your cells are collected to manufacture and test CASGEVY before it is sent back to your healthcare provider.', 'STEP 3: Shortly before your stem cell transplant, your healthcare provider will give you a conditioning medicine for a few days in hospital. This will prepare you for treatment by clearing cells from the bone marrow, so they can be replaced with the modified cells in CASGEVY. After you are given this medicine, your blood cell levels will fall to very low levels. You will stay in the hospital for this step and remain in the hospital until after the infusion with CASGEVY.', 'STEP 4: One or more vials of CASGEVY will be given into a vein (intravenous infusion) over a short period of time.', 'After the CASGEVY infusion, you will stay in hospital so that your healthcare provider can closely monitor your recovery.

Today, Legendary investor\xa0 -- nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha -- holds dozens of stocks via his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway.', ""I've gone through Berkshire's many holdings to determine what makes a stock worth holding forever. After all, forever is a long time! It turns out, though, that there are some clues. For instance, Buffett often tends to favor consumer stocks. You'll notice that they all:"", 'Grow for decades (even if they occasionally hit setbacks).', 'Sell things consumers buy repeatedly.', 'Have colossal market opportunities.', 'Here are five Buffett stocks you can buy and hold without losing sleep.', ""Naturally, Berkshire's largest holding kicks this list off. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is 47% of the portfolio. It didn't start that way, but Apple's strong performance since 2016 (when Buffett bought) made it that way, and Buffett has held the shares throughout all the success. The iPhone maker is arguably the world's most prominent company today. Over 2 billion people use iOS devices worldwide."", 'That customer base creates tremendous, though sometimes lumpy, revenue and profits as consumers buy new phones or devices and subscribe to various services, like Apple Music, Cloud, and more. Consumers do so much on their phones that it gives Apple additional growth opportunities in new categories like artificial intelligence, telehealth, and fintech in the future.', ""Buffett isn't always in stocks as early as he should be. After all, nobody is perfect. E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is an example of Buffett missing the early upside in a big winner. He bought his first shares in 2019, a position that's just 0.4% of Berkshire's holdings."", ""However, there is still a lot to be excited about with Amazon. It's the dominant e-commerce business in America, holding a 38% market share. It's also the world's leading cloud platform, with 32% of that industry."", 'Not only are e-commerce and cloud computing big markets that can still expand for years, but Amazon is actively setting up new growth opportunities, a mindset instilled by founder Jeff Bezos. Amazon is jumping into media and advertising with both feet. Its Prime membership has over 200 million members and broadcasts entertainment content and live sports via the National Football League on Prime Video. So many irons in the fire make future growth highly likely.', ""Beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) needs little introduction. It's one of the world's most widely recognized brands and has been a core holding in Berkshire's portfolio since the late 1980s. Today, the stock is Berkshire's fourth-largest holding at 6.7%. It's also a testament to dividend stocks. Berkshire receives a whopping $736 million in dividends from Coca-Cola each year."", ""Coca-Cola isn't a growth stock, but the business is growing. It's a simple recipe. Take a product portfolio with hundreds of beverage brands sold in virtually every country on Earth. Coca-Cola's products are in stores, vending machines, restaurants -- virtually everywhere they can be."", ""Factor in slow population growth, new product launches and acquisitions, and price increases, and you get decades of growth and investment returns. It's as simple as that."", 'Sticking with the beverage industry, Buffett also went to the other side of the aisle, to the alcohol business. Diageo (NYSE: DEO) is a conglomerate that owns several household alcohol brands, including Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Smirnoff, and more. In all, Diageo is doing over $20 billion in annual sales.', ""Alcohol falls into a category often called sin stocks. It's not good for you, but people have been drinking to alleviate stress and have a good time for thousands of years."", ""It's not a massive investment by Buffett's standards. Berkshire allocates just $32 million to Diageo stock, making it a rounding error in Berkshire's portfolio. But if you're looking for a company that's as certain to be around in 100 years as any, Diageo is an outstanding stock to take a look at today."", ""Lastly, Buffett has benefited from how much Americans love spending money. Credit card company American Express (NYSE: AXP) has resided in Berkshire's portfolio since the early 1990s, and it's grown to 7.6%, the portfolio's third-largest holding. Credit cards are a bedrock in consumers' household finances. Credit card debt across America totals more than $1 trillion today."", ""That will not change anytime soon, and American Express should remain a household brand name. During recent earnings calls, the company's management noted that younger generations, like Millennials and Gen Z, are its fastest-growing demographic. As these consumers mature and become the primary spenders in the economy, American Express should continue delivering for shareholders."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Mazza said 2023 has been significant for the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks which include Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others. While artificial intelligence has led the year as a primary catalyst, Mazza reckons 2024 to be divided for the big tech group. He highlighted that the bifurcation of the market may simply depend on rate cuts, when and if they are fully enforced.', 'Mazza said that the market has been performing well and has been out of the earning recessions rut, which again is a good sign for the money market.\xa0 Moreover, he added that slowing inflation rates and increasing earnings on the horizon is a testament to the expansion of earnings in the stock market. However, while 2024 holds a positive outlook, the primary concern for investors will be consumers. Rising credit card spending and consumer stress are common factors, which may be significant later in the year, or act as a game changer for the market.', 'Mazza thinks dividend aristocrats, or companies that have been consistent with their dividend growth for 20 to 25 years, will be the best place to for investors to position themselves. He further added that dividend kings and dividend monarchs will be significant to investors, especially early in 2024. He said that these companies tend to be extremely resilient against market forces and happen to report consistent and strong free cash flow. Mazza noted that the upcoming elections and the pressure on the Fed shape his less favorable view of the market for the second half of 2024.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Waste Management share price has climbed 91% in five years, easily topping the market return of 72% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 19% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Over half a decade, Waste Management managed to grow its earnings per share at 1.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""This free interactive report on Waste Management's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Waste Management's TSR for the last 5 years was 108%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Waste Management provided a TSR of 19% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 16% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

By that, we’re talking about profitable, relevant enterprises that you can trust. These aren’t necessarily sexy securities but they should help you ride out any turbulence or even outright storms.', 'Indeed, one of the main benefits of so-called unshakeable long-term dividend stocks centers on the psychological factor. So long as you’re targeting reliable entities with an established track record, you’re likely to get something. Even if your portfolio takes a hit, you can generally bank on passive income. Like in a game of football, it’s good to know you have a speedy free safety covering the zone behind you.', 'On a related note, long-term dividend stocks offer lower volatility compared to, say, the latest fad in technology.

But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) share price is up 85% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. It's also good to see a healthy gain of 59% in the last year."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""During the five years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. Indeed, the General Electric share price has gained 40% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 34% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years.

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.', 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of General Electric, it has a TSR of 151% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's nice to see that General Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 59% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 20%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand General Electric better, we need to consider many other factors.

It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.', 'Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.', 'Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.', 'Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.', 'In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) — to the screen to make this strategy more profitable.

Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions.

In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.87 points to a change of +11% from the prior year.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings."", ""This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty."", ""Andrew Witty: Thank you and good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we conclude 2023 and embark on a new year, I'd like to express my gratitude to our more than 400,000 talented colleagues who really were UnitedHealth Group. It's directly due to their tireless efforts over the past year that we expanded our opportunities to serve more people, more comprehensively. As I reflect on our 2023 performance, certainly, the shift in care activity among seniors was an important element for us to manage effectively, and the reduced Medicare Advantage funding outlook was a significant influence on how we prepared for 2024 and all the way through to 2026. Despite the shifting care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during ‘23, we've been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for reduced MA funding cycle over the next three years."", 'Even considering these factors, 2023 marked the year of balanced, sustainable growth for UnitedHealth Group. Importantly, we also strengthened the foundations, from which we will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. To illustrate briefly during 2023, Optum Health approached growth of 900,000 more patients under value-based care. UnitedHealthcare added over 1.7 million new consumers in its Medicare and commercial offerings. Optum Rx managed an additional 100 million prescriptions for people. Optum Financial handled more than $500 billion in consumer payer and care provider payments. And Optum Insights facilitated more than 23 billion electronic transactions. The increasingly impactful ways we can engage with patients, consumers, care providers, and customers resulted in revenue growth of over $47 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 13% in 2023.', ""Looking to ‘24, ‘25 and beyond, we will continue to drive quality, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to help improve healthcare system-wide, and we remain confident in and committed to our long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate. Having held our Investor Conference just six weeks ago, I'll take only a few minutes this morning to recap what you should expect from us this year, starting with our work in value-based care. Value-based care for us is a proven way of overcoming many of the widely recognized shortcomings of a fee-for-service-based health system such as fragmented consumer experiences and incentives, that can emphasize volume over quality. Our value-based offerings empower physicians to provide more connected, coordinated and comprehensive care, align incentives among consumers, care providers, and health plans, deliver better health outcomes, and improve costs."", 'See also 20 Best Non-Alcoholic Beers to Try in Dry January and Billionaire Steve Cohen Aggressively Bought These 12 Stocks Recently.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

That’s adding more political uncertainty into the picture as Washington hammers payers over claims denials and the business practices of pharmacy benefit units.', 'Here’s what experts see coming down the pike for health insurers this year.', 'The number of Americans without insurance coverage is almost certainly going to rise this year as states overhaul their Medicaid rolls, experts say.', 'During the pandemic, continuous enrollment protections led a record number of people to enroll in Medicaid. But earlier this year, states resumed checking eligibility for the safety-net program. Around 14.4 million Americans have been removed from Medicaid\xa0due to the redeterminations process, many for administrative reasons like incorrect paperwork despite remaining eligible.', '“We are going to see an increase in the uninsured rate for children and probably adults as well as a consequence,” said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.', 'The question is how big of an increase, experts said. Redeterminations began in April, but lagging information and state differences in data reporting has made it difficult to determine where individuals are turning for coverage, and in what numbers.', 'Early signs suggest some people losing Medicaid have found plans in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, though it’s probably “a very small percentage,” Alker said. More than 20 million people have signed up for ACA coverage since open enrollment began in November — an all-time high, according to data released by the Biden administration in early January.', 'Experts say the growth is due in part to redeterminations, along with the effects of more generous federal subsidies. Those subsidies are slated to expire in 2025, meaning ACA enrollment should stay elevated until then.', 'But it’s unlikely everyone who loses Medicaid will find a home on the marketplaces. The cost of family coverage without an employer remains out of reach for many Americans.\xa0It’s also too early to determine how many people terminated from Medicaid have shifted into employer coverage —\xa0that data should also emerge as 2024 continues, said Matt Fiedler, a senior fellow with the Brookings Schaeffer Initiative on Health Policy.', 'Federal regulators have also taken a number of actions to try and curb improper procedural Medicaid losses, like cracking down on states with high levels of child disenrollments. Yet,\xa0procedural terminations are unlikely to improve significantly this year, experts said.', '“We do see a very hopeful trend” in some states, like Washington and Oregon, embracing longer periods of continuous eligibility, Alker noted.', 'The government has ramped up ACA marketplace outreach, which — along with macro forces like a strong labor market — are positive signs that individuals no longer eligible for Medicaid may find alternative coverage, whether in the ACA exchanges or through employment.', 'But “it’s likely we’ll see an increase in the uninsured rate. I think the question is how much,” Fiedler said.', 'Healthcare costs are projected to grow much faster in 2024 than the historical average, fueled by inflation, supply chain disruption and labor pressures increasing provider wages. Those costs are burdening employers already stressed by worker mental health and deferred preventive screenings that could worsen health conditions down the line.', 'As a result, employers are investing heavily in mental health and substance use disorder services.\xa0Seven out of ten employers say mental healthcare access is a priority in 2024, and employers say they’ll turn to virtual care providers to address the need, according to a Business Group on Health survey.', 'As a result, employers are increasingly demanding integrated platforms combining different benefits, continuing a pivot away from the point solutions they were deluged with during the pandemic. Payers are racing to meet that need.', 'This year, UnitedHealthcare plans to integrate more than 20 standalone products into a “supported benefits platform,” said Dan Kueter, CEO of the payer’s employer and individual business,\xa0during an investor day in November.', 'Cigna, which focuses on employer-sponsored plans, plans to add more services to its behavioral health navigator to help employers personalize the platform for their employees this year, said CEO David Cordani during a November earnings call.', 'For their part, health insurers are likely to raise premiums and combat hospital reimbursement hikes in 2024 to control costs, according to credit rating agency Fitch Ratings.', 'However, that outlook is complicated by uncertainty around how much elevated care utilization seen in 2023 will continue. Some payers, like UnitedHealth and Humana, are forecasting high utilization, while others like CVS have said they expect it to drop.', 'More payers might pursue mergers and acquisitions or build out internal musculoskeletal management programs to control costs, said Prateesh Maheshwari, a managing director at venture capital firm Maverick Ventures.\xa0Hip and knee surgeries were an oft-cited driver of utilization last year.', 'Still, publicly traded health insurance companies could see their margins moderately decrease in 2024, Fitch said.', 'Surging demand for GLP-1s means insurance coverage for the drugs is expected to increase next year, putting more stress on the nation’s pressured healthcare payment system. GLP-1s, or glucagon-like peptide-1 drugs,\xa0have historically been used to treat diabetes but have shown efficacy in weight loss.', 'The drugs are exceedingly expensive, but that hasn’t stopped people from trying to get their hands on GLP-1s — off-label or not.\xa0TD Cowen predicts GLP-1 sales could reach $102 billion by 2030, with $41 billion of that for obesity.', 'More private payers are considering covering the drugs next year, though the doors to coverage aren’t being thrown wide open. According to a November survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, while 76% of employers provide GLP-1 drug coverage for diabetes, just 27% provide coverage for weight loss.', 'Yet,\xa013% are considering adding coverage for weight loss.', 'As insurance coverage increases, payers will ensure only eligible patients are accessing the drugs through checks like step therapy, said Nathan Ray, head of healthcare M&A at consultancy West Monroe. As a result, access could remain restricted.', 'Payers will also tie coverage for GLP-1s to additional behavioral management programs. That trend has\xa0proved a gold rush for chronic condition management companies and telehealth providers, which have rushed to stand up new business lines for weight loss that include GLP-1s.', '“Things like this, that include the opportunity for medication along with the accompaniment of behavioral change, is where I think the market will go in 2024,” said Heather Dlugolenski, Cigna’s U.S. commercial strategy officer.', 'Proponents of weight loss medication are also eyeing a potential overturn of the ban on Medicare coverage of weight loss drugs next year. A growing number of lawmakers (and drugmakers standing to profit from Medicare coverage) have come out in support of a bill introduced in 2023 to allow Medicare to cover anti-obesity drugs.', 'The bill is unlikely to be prioritized given Washington has a lot on its plate during the election year, but passage isn’t out of the realm of possibility, experts said.', 'More seniors will select Medicare Advantage plans this year, further growing a program that recently saw its enrollment sneak past that of traditional Medicare.', 'In MA, the government contracts with private insurers to manage the care of Medicare seniors. MA has become increasingly popular, swelling to cover 31 million people last year\xa0— a boon for insurers offering the coverage, which can be twice as profitable for private payers than other types of plans.', 'As such, MA plans have been advertising heavily,\xa0trumpeting their supplemental benefits like gym memberships or subsidized groceries. Seniors find those benefits attractive, Brookings’ Fiedler said, and may not understand that MA plans may not cover as much medical care as traditional Medicare.', '”My best bet would be MA enrollment in the near term continues to grow,” Fiedler said. “I don’t think we’re at the ceiling yet.”', 'Despite elevated costs in 2023 from seniors using more medical care,\xa0insurers generally didn’t cut back on plan benefits this year as they continue to compete for members.', 'Major payers in MA, including Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Centene and Kaiser Permanente, expanded their geographic markets for 2024, even as some lagging competitors like Cigna consider exiting MA altogether.', 'Yet, the program hasn’t been without its complications. Payers cried foul last year over tweaks to MA rates, star ratings\xa0and reimbursement audits, with Humana and Elevance suing to stop the changes.', 'MA “should remain a key long-term growth driver for managed care, but we see a more challenging setup in 2024 as weaker funding, risk coding changes, and lower Star ratings combine to pressure margins,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in an outlook report published late last year.', 'Insurers were also plagued in 2023 by congressional hearings and lawsuits over their claims reviews processes, sparking criticism that seniors may not be receiving the care they’re due.', 'Scrutiny from Washington around such practices is likely to continue.', '“We are seeing both in the Senate and House a lot of interest in peeling back the layers of the onion of how big health plans are operating their Medicare Advantage programs. That’s going to continue to be an issue,” said Reed Stephens, a healthcare chair at law firm Winston & Strawn who focuses on risk.', 'Though it’s unlikely that legislation will be passed reforming MA, Reed said. Overall,\xa0regulatory and political turbulence should subside somewhat this year.', 'The rate and marketing changes were “short of the last train out of the station,”\xa0said Brookings’ Fiedler. “The administration is unlikely to want a big fight with MA plans in an election year.”', 'Major pharmacy benefit managers will introduce more options billed as transparent and cost-effective to retain clients after some turned to upstart competitors last year.', 'PBM clients are clamoring for outcomes-based pricing, with structures tying PBM compensation to measures like adherence, according to a J.P. Morgan survey from late 2023. Clients also want transparency, whether more data sharing or full administration models.', 'The changes aren’t revolutionary, but they hint at ongoing distrust of major PBMs from benefits teams, J.P. Morgan said.', 'UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx, Cigna’s Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — which together control 80% of prescriptions in the U.S.\xa0— have all recently launched new programs, partnerships or models they say are more affordable and transparent to meet the demand.', 'The industry is likely to see more moves along those lines in 2024, experts say —\xa0especially as Congress considers legislation to reform PBMs. The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act passed the House in December. The bill is seen as unlikely to clear the Senate, but specific measures, like forced PBM transparency, could make it into larger legislative packages.', 'The passing of measures around transparency could satisfy politicians’ need for a win when it comes to drug pricing without creating meaningful reform in the sector, according to Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut.', 'Yet,\xa0momentum to do something about high drug costs will certainly carry into this year. Presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle are expected to wield the issue on the campaign trail.', '“The companies in those markets are going to have to stay nimble and keep on their toes,” said Winston & Strawn’s Stephens.', 'Companies like UnitedHealth, CVS and Humana will continue building out networks of physical care sites in 2024.\xa0New M&A guidelines from the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission could raise the bar for merger approvals, but the value proposition for insurers to acquire healthcare providers is too high for them to be dissuaded, experts said.', 'Payers will continue to pursue as many deals “as they can find willing, available targets,” said West Monroe’s Ray.', 'By directing members to owned locations for medical needs, health insurers can essentially pay themselves for providing a service, keeping more revenue in-house. As a result, payers — especially those with a large presence in MA, which incentivizes organizations to better manage cost — will stay on the hunt for acquisition targets.', 'While healthcare M&A was relatively slow in 2023,\xa068% of senior leaders in the sector expect deal volume to rise in 2024,\xa0according to a survey by investment bank Jefferies.', 'Optum — which employs or is affiliated with around one-tenth of all doctors in the U.S.\xa0— is already eyeing M&A.\xa0The health services arm of UnitedHealth is currently pursuing an acquisition of a physician-owned clinic chain in Oregon, even as it comes off a number of big provider buys in 2023, including the multi-billion-dollar acquisitions of home health providers Amedisys and LHC Group.', 'Cigna has also said it plans to look for smaller strategic acquisitions to grow its business, after a potential merger with rival Humana crumbled late last year.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

To leverage evolving market dynamics, companies must devise comprehensive roadmaps that optimize available opportunities. Effectively managing high operational costs has become the key, prompting industry players to prioritize the cost-effective development of parts and components to safeguard their market share.Profit margins face challenges from high raw material expenses, supply chain vulnerabilities amid geopolitical tensions, adverse foreign exchange translations and logistical hurdles. However, amid these obstacles, the aging vehicles and the increasing trend toward digitization offer a glimmer of hope. In this landscape, LKQ Corporation LKQ, Dorman Products DORM and Standard Motor Products SMP stand out positively due to their strategic acquisitions and initiatives that resonate well with investors.', 'Industry Overview', 'The\xa0Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts\xa0industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. Some important auto replacement components are engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts. The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or avail of professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.', 'Factors at Play', 'Vehicle Longevity Boosts Replacement Demand: As indicated by the S&P Global Mobility report unveiled in May 2023, the average age of cars and light trucks in the United States reached 12.5 years last year. This signifies the sixth consecutive year of an increase in average vehicle age and the most significant annual rise since the 2008-2009 recession. The accelerated growth in the average age of light vehicles brings benefits to the automotive replacement sector. A fleet of older vehicles implies an ongoing need for repairs and maintenance to ensure proper functionality. In tandem with the rising average vehicle age, the industry is experiencing growth as consumers allocate more resources to sustain the operation of their aging automobiles. Consequently, there has been a noticeable surge in the demand for automotive replacement parts.', 'Supply Chain Strain Amid Red Sea Crisis: The auto replacement sector is poised for challenges as supply chains encounter vulnerability amid shipping disruptions. Elevated logistic hurdles and supply chain interruptions, triggered by persistent attacks from Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, might prove to be a spoiler. Despite the initial expectations of waning inflation in 2024, manufacturers and retailers are grappling with delays and increased expenses. The ongoing Red Sea crisis, which has disrupted a vital shipping route through the Suez Canal, is expected to take a toll on the vehicle industry. This crisis is a test of resilience for the auto supply chain, with the disruptions resulting in a surge in transportation costs.', 'Cost Headwinds Prevail: The auto replacement industry is grappling with challenges arising from high raw material and labor costs. Although there has been alleviation of raw material costs, they still exceed pre-pandemic levels. The lingering impact of inflation is expected to continue over the short haul, putting pressure on the margins of auto replacement firms. Additionally, the widespread global presence of most industry participants exposes them to potential difficulties related to foreign exchange. Adverse currency translations are expected to have a detrimental impact on earnings and margins.', 'Challenges Amid Tech Advancements: The rising adoption of electric vehicles has prompted substantial investments in the advancement of cutting-edge automotive components. Yet, the elevated costs associated with these technologies present a notable hurdle to the profitability of auto replacement parts. As the industry adapts to the dynamic trends and requirements of the automotive market, companies face the ongoing challenge of consistently enhancing and updating their product offerings. This entails significant capital investments and research and development expenditures. Consequently, these costs are expected to strain operating margins and cash flows within the industry.', 'Digital Overhaul Impact: The rise of e-commerce and online retail has fundamentally transformed the landscape of the auto replacement parts industry, offering unparalleled accessibility, a diverse range of options and enhanced convenience for consumers. Online platforms enable customers to effortlessly compare a vast selection of replacement parts, peruse reviews and access comprehensive product information, facilitating well-informed purchasing decisions.

Contrast that with Home Depot, which is expecting a roughly 4% decline for fiscal 2023.', 'Looking behind those headline growth metrics reveals the scope of demand challenges that these businesses face.

Home Depot is also seeing improvements in its customer traffic rates, helping explain why Wall Street is getting more optimistic about the stock. There could be a modest industry rebound ahead once interest rates begin falling again."", ""P&G shares are a bit more expensive on both a price-to-earnings and price-to-sales basis.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Worst States for Dividend Income Investors.', 'On December 30, 2023, Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance, where he discussed the possible investment opportunities in 2024. Mazza said 2023 has been significant for the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks which include Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others. While artificial intelligence has led the year as a primary catalyst, Mazza reckons 2024 to be divided for the big tech group. He highlighted that the bifurcation of the market may simply depend on rate cuts, when and if they are fully enforced.', 'Mazza said that the market has been performing well and has been out of the earning recessions rut, which again is a good sign for the money market.\xa0 Moreover, he added that slowing inflation rates and increasing earnings on the horizon is a testament to the expansion of earnings in the stock market. However, while 2024 holds a positive outlook, the primary concern for investors will be consumers. Rising credit card spending and consumer stress are common factors, which may be significant later in the year, or act as a game changer for the market.', 'Mazza thinks dividend aristocrats, or companies that have been consistent with their dividend growth for 20 to 25 years, will be the best place to for investors to position themselves. He further added that dividend kings and dividend monarchs will be significant to investors, especially early in 2024. He said that these companies tend to be extremely resilient against market forces and happen to report consistent and strong free cash flow. Mazza noted that the upcoming elections and the pressure on the Fed shape his less favorable view of the market for the second half of 2024. Therefore, until consumer behavior is unclear, it might be safer to stick to elite dividend payers.', ""The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the most notable companies known for their continuous dividend growth rates.

The initiative suggests that no sparkling 500-mL water bottle will be made from virgin plastic starting in 2024. The initiative is a huge step forward for the company\'s sustainability plans. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has implemented a cyclical system in place, which spreads across the recycling, cleaning, and sorting of plastic until it is transformed into flakes to produce new bottles. To support the initiative, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also launched an advertising campaign called ""Recycle Me Again.""', ""The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is another top stock pick among dividend investors, as of January 16 the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.50%.

As of January 16, the stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.93%. The company's commitment to expand is a testament to its popularity in the industry. On January 8, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) signed an agreement to acquire Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM) for a staggering $2.0 billion. The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company is focused on designing next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Such will enhance the efficacy across multiple cancer indications such as the ARX517, ARX788, and ARX305. The acquisition will allow Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to leverage Ambrx's (NASDAQ:AMAM) ADC technology to eliminate cancer cells using monoclonal antibodies linked to a potent chemotherapeutic payload."", 'Wall Street is positive on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). On January 9, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen reiterated an Overweight rating on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and maintained her price target of $215. Over the past 3 months, 7 Wall Street analysts have held a buy opinion on the stock.

People looking for that daily energy boost -- especially younger people -- are turning to carbonated energy drinks like Red Bull over soda, coffee, and tea.', 'This trend is predicted to only continue with analysts expecting the global energy and sports drink market to hit $233 billion in annual spending by 2027, up from $159 billion in 2021.', 'Monster Beverage has been one of the big beneficiaries of this trend as the owner of one of the leading energy drink brands worldwide.', 'Aptly named, the company has produced monster returns for shareholders. Since the mid-1990s, shares have risen by over 150,000%, absolutely crushing the broad market over that time frame.', 'But there is a new entrant to the energy drink industry, and it has started to take market share from the likes of Monster Beverage and Red Bull. Enter Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), the third-largest but fastest-growing energy drink brand in the United States. Its stock is up close to 5,000% in the last five years, handily outperforming both Monster and the S&P 500.', ""In 2023 alone, Celsius stock was up 57%.

Remarkably, five years ago, Celsius's trailing-12-month revenue was just $55 million. As you can see, its brand has caught fire, especially in North America, which is the source of over 95% of the company's sales."", 'With this increasing scale, Celsius has shown some impressive margin expansion. Through the first three quarters of 2023, gross margin climbed 780 basis points to 48.1% with the most recent quarter hitting an all-time high of 50.4%. With increasing leverage on its overhead costs and expanding gross margins, Celsius should be able to expand its bottom-line net margin at an impressive clip, as long as revenue keeps growing quickly.', 'Even with this impressive growth, Celsius is still significantly smaller than rival Monster Beverage, which reported $6.9 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Monster is a global brand, while Celsius has mainly been a phenomenon in North America.', 'Going global with a packaged-goods brand is complicated. Luckily, Celsius has a new partner in PepsiCo to help with global distribution.', 'In exchange for a minority stake in Celsius, Pepsi now carries Celsius products as part of its massive distribution network, helping the smaller brand expand both at home and abroad. Importantly, this can get Celsius in prime slots at convenience stores and other shops that sell energy drinks, which is typically an advantage that incumbents like Red Bull have.', ""Celsius's international revenue grew 56% year over year in the third quarter. Investors should expect this rapid growth to continue or even accelerate thanks to the PepsiCo partnership."", ""If Celsius keeps beating analyst expectations and growing revenue at a triple-digit pace, the stock will likely do well again in 2024. It's hard to be bearish when revenue is doubling every year."", ""But smart investors know the long-term story is what matters. Buyers of Celsius stock need to evaluate the business looking out at least three to five years. The stock's current market capitalization of $13.9 billion gives it a price-to-sales multiple of 12.3. That premium valuation might immediately scare some investors away, but this is a company that's likely to double or triple its revenue over the next couple of years while expanding its margins as well. That explains why it's forward-looking valuation metrics are much more reasonable with shares trading at 40 times earnings and 6 times sales."", ""Of course, Celsius isn't guaranteed to keep growing at its current pace, but the company only seems to be building momentum thanks to its growing reach in the strong market for energy drinks."", ""It's hard to predict whether Celsius stock will crush the market again in 2024, but I expect it to be a winning stock over the next five years and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Celsius wasn't one of them.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Gap (NYSE:GPS), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Gap:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.052 = US$410m ÷ (US$11b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""Thus, Gap has an ROCE of 5.2%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 12%."", ' View our latest analysis for Gap ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Gap compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Gap here  for free."", ""In terms of Gap's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 5.2% from 24% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""To conclude, we've found that Gap is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", ""Gap does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Gap  that you might be interested in."", ""While Gap isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?
