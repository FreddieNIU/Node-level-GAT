This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $2.93 per share, indicating a change of -40.1% from the year-ago quarter.

19,0f214e7f-59a9-3c24-9743-0b73eb398e82,WMT,2024-01-04,"COST, WMT, FIVE: Which Strong-Buy-Rated Retail Stock is Best?",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cost-wmt-five-strong-buy-003143661.html,1704328303,STORY,"['COST', 'WMT', 'FIVE']","['The retail space is sure to see more than its fair share of challenges for 2024, a year that may finally see that long-awaited and prepared-for economic downturn. That said, I think the best-in-breed defensive retailers (such as COST, WMT, and FIVE) can continue flexing their muscles in the new year. Just ask the many Wall Street bulls who continue to stand by their “Buy” ratings.', 'Therefore, let’s check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to analyze the three Strong-Buy-rated retailers that could continue serving up delicious gains for investors.', 'First up, we have Costco, a wholesale retailer that went parabolic in early December to close off a spectacular 2023. In 2023, the stock surged more than 43%, and though shares have retreated more than 5% off their all-time high of $681.91, I believe Costco’s tailwinds will carry into the new year.', 'After the parabolic surge on the back of strong quarterly earnings, a pullback is only healthy and perhaps a “golden” buying opportunity for investors seeking a more modest entry point. As Costco navigates into a year of uncertainty, I remain bullish, as the firm seems well-equipped to deal with whatever the market throws at it.', 'On the one hand, Costco is a one-stop shop for consumers looking to get great deals on their groceries and other necessities. Costco members tend to get a great value for their annual memberships, especially during inflation or economic hardship. Should a recession and lingering inflation be in store for 2024, look for Costco to continue as a haven for consumers starved for bargains.', 'If the economy fares better and consumers become more willing to spend on discretionaries, Costco also stands to win big. Costco’s store layout is all about giving consumers a “treasure hunt” experience. With more disposable income and the mentality that Costco members need to buy more to make their annual memberships worthwhile, the firm has a lot to gain in a hotter economy that sees consumer sentiment shift higher.', 'The company has done a great job of mixing the “need” items (like necessities) with the “wants.” By offering intriguing new products, like gold bullion (a hot seller of late), Costco may very well be the company that’s positioned to win, regardless of where the economy heads next.', 'Costco stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 20 Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average COST stock price target\xa0of $670.28 implies 4% upside potential.', 'Walmart stock rose by around 10% in 2023, falling behind the S&P 500 (SPX), which clocked in a return of around 24%. The massive retailer has a robust grocery presence and an every-improving e-commerce platform. However, shares of WMT finished 2023 in a bit of a rut following the release of some modest quarterly earnings with a side of downbeat expectations for consumer spending.', 'Undoubtedly, the performance gap between Walmart and Costco begs the question: are more Walmart shoppers headed over to Costco amid inflation and economic struggles?', 'In a way, I do believe Costco is beckoning more consumers in its doors, with promises of $1.50 hotdog combos and more competitive prices. The shine of gold bullion may also play a minor impact, given that investor appetite for precious metals has surged in recent months.', 'In any case, I don’t think you can count Walmart stock out of the game just because it’s been outpaced by the likes of Costco. Shares of WMT may actually be in a spot to make up for lost time. Just check out TD Cowen’s recent note, which praised Walmart as one of its best ideas for 2024.', 'TD Cowen’s Oliver Chen is a fan of the company’s ability to play offense and defense. I couldn’t agree more. However, Walmart may wish to take a page out of Costco’s playbook by offering more “wants” (like gold) if it wants more rally power come the next big economic expansion.', 'Mr. Chen has a $188.00 price target on WMT stock, entailing 18% upside from here.', 'Walmart stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 25 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average WMT stock price target\xa0of $180.79 implies 13.5% upside potential.', 'FiveBelow is a discount retailer that all discount retailers should strive to be more like. The firm doesn’t just offer great deals on a wide range of products, but it really seems to be hitting the spot with younger audiences. For this reason, I’m bullish on the firm and its growth prospects in the new year. The company, which has sold goods priced well above $5 for quite some time now, has a slogan that I believe tells the story: let go & have fun.', 'As a discount retailer that seems to be the mixture of a dollar store and a toy store, it’s no mystery as to why FIVE stock has done so incredibly well in recent years. The stock is getting closer to a new high, just over 16% shy of its mid-2021 peak. In 2024, I do believe FIVE below can eclipse new heights as the firm continues to fire on all cylinders in its corner of retail.', 'Finally, strength during the holiday season could help power an impressive quarterly beat. It’s not hard to imagine many cash-strapped consumers heading over to the local FiveBelow for festive gifts over the likes of pricier toy retailers. Either way, I believe such strength could carry over to 2024 following management’s confidence that came ahead of the holidays (its most recent guidance came in ahead of expectations).', 'FiveBelow stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average FIVE stock price target\xa0of $218.31 implies 6.65% upside potential.', 'Retail could continue to fare well for investors in 2024, especially when it comes to the Strong-Buy-rated top performers, which, I believe, could continue to take market share away from rivals that are lacking on the pricing competitiveness front. Of the trio of retail plays in this piece, analysts expect the most upside from Walmart (13.5%).', 'Disclosure']"

Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71% and 12.9% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMT', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Walmart here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Walmart, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is WMT a Good Investment?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.44.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart.

The business model is designed to produce steadily growing income and to create shareholder value over time, and the proof is in the numbers."", 'Since listing on the NYSE in 1994, Realty Income has produced a 13.4% annualized total return, handily beating the S&P 500.

Since consumers usually pare back their spending during recessions, there was clear angst toward anything having to do with the retail industry.', ""However, Realty Income has demonstrated for roughly three decades that it's anything but ordinary."", ""One of the factors that makes Realty Income special is its vast commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. Approximately 91% of total rent spanning its greater than 13,200-property portfolio is derived from businesses that are resilient to economic downturns. This includes grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, and general merchandise stores, which collectively account for about 39% of the company's annualized contractual rent. These are stores that cater to basic-need goods and services in any economic climate."", ""In addition to focusing on recession-resilient industries, Realty Income has been steadily diversifying its CRE portfolio. It's engineered two deals over the past two years that have allowed it to enter the casino industry. It's also in the process of acquiring Spirit Realty Capital in an all-share deal that clocks in at $9.3 billion. Spirit Realty's CRE portfolio will complement Realty Income's existing assets, while allowing the combined company to further diversify beyond retail."", 'History offers comfort for investors, as well.

Since most small- and micro-cap companies are unproven, they often lack broad-based access to traditional debt and credit markets. When these smaller businesses are able to land financing deals, it's usually at high interest rates. PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments clocked in at a cool 12.6%, as of the end of September."", ""Another aspect of PennantPark's debt-securities portfolio that's critical to the company's success is that 100% of the loans it holds are variable rate. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised its federal funds target rate by 525 basis points. In return, PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments has surged by 520 basis points to the noted 12.6% over the trailing two years."", ""To add to the above, all but $0.1 million of its $906.3 million in debt securities is first-lien secured. If one of the company's borrowers were to seek bankruptcy protection, first-lien secured debtholders are first in line for repayment. It should be noted that just 0.9% of the company's portfolio (relative to its cost basis) was non-accrual (i.e., delinquent), as of Sept. 30. This is a testament to the exceptional vetting of the company's loan/investment team."", ""The third high-yield stock that's capable of generating $100 in super safe monthly dividend income in 2024 from a starting investment of $11,925 (split equally in thirds) is mortgage REIT AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC). Although most stocks can't sustain a 15% yield, AGNC has averaged a double-digit yield in 13 of the past 14 years."", 'Without getting overly complicated, mortgage REITs aim to borrow money at short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase long-term assets with higher yields, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The goal for mortgage REITs is to widen their net interest margin, which is the average yield on the assets they own less their average borrowing rate.', ""Last year was, arguably, the most challenging on record for the mortgage REIT industry. The Fed's aggressive rate-hiking cycle sent short-term borrowing costs soaring, which ultimately shrank the net interest margin for all mortgage REITs."", 'But there is good news on the horizon for AGNC and its peers. The Federal Reserve has tentatively penciled in three interest rate cuts for the new year. Mortgage REITs historically perform their best during rate-easing cycles.', ""The biggest catalyst in 2024 would be an end to what's currently the second-longest yield-curve inversion in history. Normally, longer-dated Treasury bonds have higher yields than Treasury bills set to mature in a matter of months. But for much of 2023, the yield on the three-month T-bill trounced the yield on the 10-year T-bond. Should the yield curve normalize in 2024, AGNC's net interest margin would be primed for expansion."", 'Something else to consider about AGNC Investment is that it predominantly puts its money to work in agency securities. An ""agency"" asset is backed by the federal government in the event of default. Though this added protection does reduce the yield AGNC nets on its MBSs, it importantly allows the company to deploy leverage to boost its profit potential.', 'Look for 2024 to be a bounce-back year for AGNC and the mortgage REIT industry.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

She is responsible for the development of new paper and cellulose packaging solutions and leading the process from lab-scale prototypes to manufacturing. Outside of work, Manali is the co-host of the ""Talk Green to Me"" podcast, which features interviews with experts on materials and sustainability topics.', ""How is the work you're doing advancing SEE's fiber-based portfolio?"", ""My team and I identify key properties and source paper and fiber materials that will provide the protection SEE's customers require. I use paper materials to develop new solutions such as mailers, sustainable foams, and other types of protective packaging. My work includes expanding our testing capabilities for paper-based products, writing standing operating procedures for new paper testing equipment, and broadening our knowledge of fiber-based products."", 'How is SEE integrating paper and fiber materials across its packaging solutions portfolio?', ""SEE has actually had paper and fibers in its portfolio for a long time. Solutions such as SEALED AIR® brand padded mailers, the SEALED AIR® brand ProPad paper cushioning system, and SEALED AIR® brand TempGuard insulated box liners all use paper from SEE's own paper mills. Ultimately, we are aiming to expand and integrate fiber materials with our automation capabilities to create robust on-demand paper solutions for our customers as we have done with plastics."", 'Talk about the science and technology behind paper and what makes the material not only an overall sustainable packaging solution, but also a good choice for product protection.', ""Paper and fiber technologies have been around for a long time because paper and cellulose fibers are renewable materials that come from trees and plants, which are abundantly available. Being completely recyclable and biodegradable, paper is a great sustainable material for making products. The key innovation behind SEE's paper and fiber-based packaging solutions is achieving performance. The stiffness and strength of the material make paper a great void-fill solution. There is also high-impact protection because of the tear strength of paper, especially virgin paper, since cellulose fibers are long and retain the strength. Similarly, the long cellulose fibers can make paper quite moldable, which is a property that is leveraged for cushioning."", ""What recent innovations has SEE made within its paper/fiber portfolio that are solving our customers' challenges?"", ""SEE recently launched the AUTOBAG® brand 850S paper mail order fulfillment system, which offers two types of paper mailers: bleached (which can be imprinted) and natural Kraft. This is the first-of-its kind semi-automated bagger that can use paper mailers-a huge step in advancing our fiber packaging portfolio. End users can easily recycle these mailers in curbside bins. While we already have discrete mailers in the paper space, adding automation is a differentiator. SEE's new BUBBLE WRAP® brand paper bubble mailer also brings cushioning protection to our mailer portfolio while keeping the entire solution fiber based and recyclable. This solution meets the needs of many customers who are looking for a sustainable alternative that doesn't compromise product protection."", 'How did we incorporate the look, feel, and protection of our flagship product, BUBBLE WRAP® brand original cushioning, into a paper packaging solution?', ""I started working on the BUBBLE WRAP® brand paper bubble mailer shortly after joining SEE and used my experience in paper engineering to determine the exact properties and ranges of properties that would get us to the level of protection that our existing mailers provide. We also wanted to go back to our roots and get the appearance of bubbles within a mailer. Various SEE teams evaluated papers in the lab and on the line to ensure the materials would provide cushioning and convert properly without tearing.

While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both posted double-digit gains for the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the big winner with its 42% return.', 'The frenzy surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) was a big catalyst that fueled momentum in tech stocks throughout 2023. But you might be wondering which companies are positioned to continue winning in 2024. Let\'s explore three members of the exclusive ""Magnificent Seven"" club and assess why each of these stocks look poised to continue dominating in 2024.', 'Investors can credit Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) with kicking off the AI arms race. Following prior investments in 2019 and 2021, Microsoft committed to a $10 billion investment in OpenAI in early 2023. OpenAI is the unicorn start-up behind the wildly popular ChatGPT.', ""Following its partnership, Microsoft swiftly integrated ChatGPT throughout its Windows operating system. The AI-powered applications are already generating billions in incremental revenue, especially in its Azure cloud business. However, the area investors should keep a close eye on in 2024 is Microsoft's productivity assistant called CoPilot."", ""Investors can get a glimpse of Wall Street's purview based on surveys from research analysts. Perhaps two of the biggest bulls are Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne and Truist Securities' Joel Fishbein. Materne believes that CoPilot could generate $100 billion of revenue before the end of the decade."", ""Given that Microsoft introduced CoPilot to the masses in November, there isn't a ton of tangible data to assess just yet. So while Materne's forecast is encouraging, it's too early to know its accuracy. The broader theme here is that Wall Street is bullish on the secular trends that generative AI present, and clearly believe Microsoft will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. To add some quantitative analysis here, Fishbein's most recent report on Microsoft included a three-year price target of $600. That assumes 60% upside from Microsoft's current trading levels."", ""The way I see it, Microsoft has proved it can command meaningful growth from its investments in AI. Now, the bigger challenge will be whether it can sustain this growth, and do so profitably. As an investor in Microsoft, I will keep a close eye on CoPilot's progress throughout 2024, as well as the company's operating margin. Should Microsoft accelerate both its top and bottom lines, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock continue soaring."", ""Unlike its cohort, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) wasn't the fastest in Big Tech to join the AI marathon. After months of sitting on the sidelines, the company made headlines after its $4 billion investment in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Although some investors may view the partnership as too little, too late, I see things differently."", ""The cornerstone of the Anthropic deal is cloud computing. Throughout 2022 and 2023, corporate software spend decelerated as businesses were trying to navigate a cloudy macroeconomy plagued by inflation and high interest rates. As a result, Amazon's cloud business started to shrink."", 'But as the best companies often do, Amazon exercised patience and waited for an attractive opportunity to reignite growth. The specific condition from the Anthropic partnership that has me most excited is the role AI will play on Bedrock. Bedrock is a managed service offering developers various large language models\xa0and a multitude of generative AI applications, including text generation for blogs, virtual assistants, and image generators for graphic designers.', ""With the stock trading at just a 2.8 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, investors can see Amazon is trading at a steep discount to its 10-year average based on this measure. At just $150 per share, Amazon stock looks like an absolute bargain right now. I see Bedrock as the next phase of growth for Amazon Web Services, and 2024 could provide investors with a glimpse of the cloud platform's evolution, which should lead to further shareholder gains."", ""Advertising leader and cloud computing giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) may be the most interesting stock on my list for potential winners in 2024. Alphabet is the parent company to the world's top two most visited websites -- Internet search engine Google and video-sharing platform YouTube."", 'Alphabet completely reimagined digital advertising, which helped the company generate billions in sales and profits. But over the past few years, competitors such as Instagram and TikTok have gained popularity, particularly in the highly coveted Gen Z and millennial demographics. This dynamic, coupled with a tough economy, caused advertisers to rethink how and where to prioritize their budgets.', ""But amid this crisis, Alphabet found a silver lining. Like its peers that we've discussed, Alphabet saw the potential in artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology could play an integral role in its ecosystem. Most recently, Alphabet introduced Gemini, its competitor to ChatGPT. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet is integrating AI across its entire suite of products and services, including productivity tools and cloud infrastructure."", 'The chart illustrates Alphabet\'s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.2 is the lowest among the ""Magnificent Seven."" I see this as a major buying opportunity as the capital markets overlook the potential that AI can play for Alphabet\'s business. With the stock trading at roughly $140 per share, 2024 could be a unique opportunity to begin dollar-cost averaging into a position.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Meanwhile, it emerged as one of the biggest threats in artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023 thanks to a lucrative partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI."", 'Shares in Microsoft have risen more than 380,000% since it went public in 1986, which could suggest the best time to buy its stock was long ago. However, the tech industry is an ever-expanding market known for offering innovative companies consistent gains over the long term. As one of its leaders, Microsoft likely still has much to offer new investors in the coming years.', ""So, here's why it's not too late to buy Microsoft stock."", 'An economic downturn caused a dramatic sell-off in 2022, with tech stocks hit particularly hard. Spikes in inflation led to reductions in consumer and commercial spending, reflected in multiple quarters of dismal earnings from several companies.', 'While Microsoft was not unscathed, it outperformed many of its peers during the challenging year, illustrating the lack of vulnerabilities in its business compared to the competition.', ""This chart shows Microsoft's stock experienced a more moderate decline than many of the most prominent tech firms and was one of the few to outperform the Nasdaq Composite in 2022. While many of these companies relied heavily on economically vulnerable industries like digital advertising and the consumer sector, Microsoft's larger focus on software fortified its business against the worst market declines."", ""Easing inflation and excitement over budding sectors like AI have triggered a recovery for the tech market over the last year, with the future bright for many companies in 2024. However, it's still worth dedicating a significant portion of your portfolio to a reliable stock like Microsoft, which you can confidently hold no matter the economic climate."", ""In the first quarter of 2024 (which ended September 2023), Microsoft posted revenue growth of 13% year over year as it beat analysts' expectations by almost $2 billion. Meanwhile, its free cash flow topped $63 billion. As a result, the company is on a promising growth path, with the funds to fuel its research and development (R&D) and overcome any potential headwinds."", 'Microsoft had the foresight of the decade when it invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019.

One of the biggest standouts among this cohort was semiconductor company Nvidia, which saw its market cap balloon to more than $1 trillion, fueled by unprecedented demand for chips used to train generative AI models.', ""While each of the companies above has a multitude of ways to benefit from AI tailwinds, savvy investors should know that myriad opportunities exist in the capital markets. One such company that looks set up to dominate in 2024 is Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)."", ""While the company's growth in 2023 paled in comparison to Nvidia's, AMD may have just made its best countermove yet, setting up 2024 to be a milestone year. Let's dig into what AMD has in the cards, and why scooping up shares now could be a lucrative opportunity."", 'In early December, AMD released a new line of AI chips. The cornerstone of the product release was the MI300X, AMD\'s biggest answer yet to Nvidia\'s unrelenting graphics processing units (GPUs) operation. During the unveiling, AMD\'s CEO Lisa Su made a bold declaration when she called the MI300X ""the most advanced AI accelerator in the industry.""', ""If that doesn't get you excited, let's check out some of the use cases around the MI300X accelerator that support Su's high degree of confidence."", 'Microsoft is going to use the MI300X for applications in its leading cloud platform Azure, a strategy that could further propel the dominance of ChatGPT.', ""Remember, Microsoft previously made a massive $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT. Moreover, with the release of its new CoPilot offering, Microsoft's plans to integrate ChatGPT throughout its ecosystem are becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, it's likely the Windows developer will be highly selective with its vendor partners to ensure its massive investments in AI pay off."", ""Another noteworthy partnership includes Meta, which announced that it will be using the MI300X for AI inferencing. This is important because these use cases could be early indications that AMD's newest chips will be a bellwether for data center business -- a market that is largely dominated by Nvidia right now."", 'Following the public release of the MI300X, Su sat down with CNBC to speak in more detail about how these chips could represent the next frontier of growth. More specifically, Su said that she believes the addressable market for data center AI accelerators will reach $400 billion by 2027.', ""To put this figure in perspective, during AMD's Q3 earnings call management guided for $2 billion in data center GPU revenue for 2024. Although this looks like a low forecast relative to the potential size of the market, I'm not worried for AMD."", ""Given the sky-high demand for Nvidia's GPUs, the company has made significant investments in manufacturing and production. I see this as an opportunity for AMD to make inroads in the data center AI market and acquire additional market share. Why? Because as Nvidia's backlog continues to grow, I see customers diversifying their GPU needs and turning to more than one provider."", 'So while Nvidia may dominate the space right now, I think AMD has a greenfield opportunity to provide customers with commensurate (if not superior) technology, and do so at a potentially lower cost and faster delivery time.', ""For this reason, I see AMD's forecast of $2 billion in data center GPU revenue to be conservative. Furthermore, I am incredibly bullish that this figure could grow exponentially in just a few years."", 'AMD stock rocketed 123% during 2023. Yet Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities sees another 45% upside for AMD stock, giving it a price target of $200.', ""Don't worry too much about whether AMD reaches or exceeds this price target in 2024. Rather, ask yourself if you believe in the long-term secular trend of AI, and if AMD is well positioned to benefit."", ""I think the MI300X came at just the right time. While Nvidia is the dominant player in AI GPUs, AMD has a unique opportunity to capitalize on unprecedented demand in the data center space in particular. Investors should view AI as more of a marathon than a sprint, keeping in mind that AMD spent a good portion of 2023 making strategic acquisitions, which haven't been fully integrated or monetized yet."", ""So while AMD's current growth is not as exciting as that of its larger counterpart, its roadmap is hard to ignore. Moreover, as various applications for GPU technology begin to take shape, I see AMD emerging as a formidable leader in the space."", ""If you're looking for alternatives to Nvidia or seeking hedges to other AI plays in your portfolio, I wouldn't sleep on AMD. In fact, given the early positive indications of MI300X's demand, 2024 could end up being a massive year for the chip company, and represent the beginning of a long-term strong force in data center AI."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

That can shortchange their returns."", ""That's clear from the total returns generated by dividend stocks over the last half-century. While dividend payers have produced a 9.2% average annual return, according to data from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, there's a huge disparity. Dividend growers and initiators have produced a 10.2% average annual total return, while companies with no change in their dividend policy have only delivered a 6.6% average annual total return. "", ""That strong returns data for dividend initiators and growers is why dividend-focused investors shouldn't overlook Paycom Software (NYSE: PAYC). While the cloud-based payroll company currently offers a seemingly paltry payout (it yields 0.7%, about 50% less than the S&P 500 index), it just initiated that dividend last year. Further, it should have no problem growing its payout in the future. That puts it in an excellent position to produce attractive total returns."", ""Paycom unveiled its cash dividend policy last May. It set its inaugural dividend payment at $0.375 per share each quarter ($1.50 annually). The initiation of a dividend marked the next step in the company's strategy to return value to shareholders (it has also spent around $700 million to buy back about 5 million shares over the years). "", ""That dividend payment is a small portion of its cash flow. It costs the company about $22 million per quarter. That puts its dividend payout ratio at less than 20% of its operating cash flow and around 25% of its earnings. This low rate enables the company to retain a lot of cash to fund growth, repurchase shares, and maintain a cash-rich balance sheet. With $484 million cash and only $29 million debt, Paycom's cash balance alone could fund its dividend payment for several quarters if its cash flow dried up. "", 'Paycom left itself with plenty of room to grow its dividend. For starters, its payout ratio is well below that of its peers in the industry. Payroll leader ADP (NASDAQ: ADP) targets a payout ratio between 55% and 60% of its earnings. Meanwhile, Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX) has paid out around 75% of its free cash flow in dividends over its last two fiscal years. ', 'However, Paycom can grow its dividend without increasing its payout ratio. Its earnings and cash flow are growing briskly, which should support a rising dividend. Its revenue jumped more than 25% through the first nine months of 2023, while its earnings per share surged almost 29%. Meanwhile, its operating cash flow rocketed nearly 50% through the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. ', ""On the one hand, Paycom won't grow quite as fast in the near term. The company's cutting-edge payroll software, Beti, is proving to be too good at eliminating payroll errors. That's causing lower-than-expected service revenues and unscheduled payroll runs, which has weighed on revenue growth. This headwind should remain in force over the next year. That drives Paycom's belief that its sales growth will slow to 10%-12% in 2024. However, that's still a solid growth rate (ADP and Paychex expect their revenue to rise 6% to 7% during their 2024 fiscal years). "", ""While Paycom sees growth slowing in the near term, it could reaccelerate in the future. The company continues to invest heavily in innovation, sales, and marketing. Those investments should help drive growing cross-sales with existing clients and help it win new customers. Paycom believes it has a long growth runway to capture a large and growing market for providing payroll and other HR solutions. The company's growing earnings and cash flow should enable it to steadily increase its dividend in the coming years. That has been the case for rivals ADP and Paychex. APD delivered its 49th year of dividend growth in 2023 (increasing its payment by 12%), while Paychex has steadily increased its payout over the years, including by 13% last year. "", ""Paycom joined the ranks of dividend payers last year. While the company started small, it has the financial strength and growth prospects to increase its payout at a high rate in the coming years. That bodes well for its investors, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically been strong performers. That outperformance is even more likely considering that the stock took a beating last year and now sits nearly 45% below its 52-week high. That prospect of earning market-beating total returns powered by a growing dividend is why dividend investors shouldn't overlook Paycom's rather small payout.

Sometimes, strength begets even more strength. However, genuinely undervalued stocks tend to deliver more confidence to market participants. At their core, these prospects may be inherently de-risked. As a result, more room for upswing exists.', 'Another factor to consider is that you may be less likely to hold the bag if a sudden downturn materializes.

As multiple sources have pointed out, global smoking prevalence decreased significantly over the past several years. Further, BTI itself suffered a substantial erosion of market value, losing 27% since the January opener.', 'Nevertheless, for agnostic speculators, BTI could be an intriguing bargain prospect. Fundamentally, while smoking rates have declined globally, in many countries, either no change occurred or prevalence increased. Further, the vaping or e-cigarette sector has grown in popularity. Just in the U.S., revenue for the space will reach $8.3 billion at year’s end. Further, the segment may expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.93% from 2023 to 2028.', 'It’s also worth pointing out that BTI enjoys strong margins across the board. It’s also been consistently profitable over the past decade. Even so, shares trade at only 6.22X forward earnings, lower than the sector median 9.78X. Thus, it’s an intriguing prospect for undervalued stocks.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A hydrocarbon energy giant, it’s not too hard to see why Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) ranks among the stocks Wall Street overlooked. With the political and ideological winds favoring green and renewable energy solutions, Exxon appears to be battling with inevitability.

Yes, electric vehicles and other alternatives to the hydrocarbon paradigm have gained ground. Still, the infrastructure remains a fossil-fuel-dominated arena. As well, hydrocarbon products such as gasoline command high energy density. Unfortunately, you can’t cheat scientific realities.', 'Further, the company holds its own financially. For example, its three-year EBITDA growth rate clocks in at 37%, above 75.39% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable, aside from an understandable hiccup in 2020.

Unsurprisingly, investment data aggregator Gurufocus stated that Everest enjoys four positive financial signs and no glaring negatives.', 'As a bonus, it’s priced at a bargain rate, with shares trading at 5.9X forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at nearly 10X.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'Easily one of the riskiest ideas among undervalued stocks Wall Street overlooked, ZTO Express (NYSE:ZTO) isn’t for the faint of heart.

Still, China could piggyback off the U.S.', 'As the number one and two economies of the world, what’s good for the U.S. could trickle down to the Asian juggernaut.

To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 30% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE.

After all, the share price is down 15% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market.', ""It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that."", ' View our latest analysis for Northern Trust ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.

This change in EPS is reasonably close to the 5% average annual decrease in the share price.

It seems like the share price is reflecting the declining earnings per share.', ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive.

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Northern Trust's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Northern Trust's TSR for the last 3 years was -7.3%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Investors in Northern Trust had a tough year, with a total loss of 6.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 25%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

(NYSE:ZTS) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of March to $0.432. This takes the annual payment to 0.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying."", ' View our latest analysis for Zoetis ', 'The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, Zoetis was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 37.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.26 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.73. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", 'Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Zoetis has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 16% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.', 'Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Zoetis that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is Zoetis not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Lower oil and gas prices, along with higher interest rates, weighed on the sector. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 index lost about 4% on the year, compared to a 24% gain for the broader market index. ', ""That sell-off has many energy stocks looking like relatively attractive buying opportunities. However, not all are worth buying after last year's downdraft. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) are two that look like great ones to buy on the dip. However, Tellurian (NYSEMKT: TELL) is one energy stock that investors should avoid like the plague, even though its share price is a lot lower these days. "", 'Tellurian had a rough 2023. Shares of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility developer plunged 55%. The main factor weighing on the stock was concerns about how it would finance its massive Driftwood LNG export facility and related Driftwood Pipeline Project. ', ""Those projects are a massive undertaking. Tellurian estimates that phase one will cost about $14.5 billion. That's a lot more than the company can handle on its own, given its current size ($800 million enterprise value). It's seeking equity partners to help fund more than half the project's equity requirements. "", ""However, rising interest rates and falling natural gas prices have made finding partners interested in the project more challenging. It's seeking to partner with oil and gas producers that would also use a large portion of the facility's capacity to export their gas. That limits its options. "", ""Because of that, there's a significant risk that Tellurian might not find the partners needed to fund this project at acceptable terms. That makes the stock too risky for most investors, which is why they should avoid it like the plague."", 'Lower oil and gas prices weighed on shares of Chevron last year, which fell about 17%. However, that dip looks like an attractive buying opportunity. ', ""One factor fueling that view is Chevron's moves over the past year to enhance its cash flow and growth profile. The company acquired PDC Energy in a $7.6 billion deal to enhance its operations across two key U.S. energy basins. Chevron sees the deal adding $1 billion to its annual free cash flow in 2024, assuming oil averages around $70 per barrel (right around the current price). "", 'In addition, Chevron also agreed to buy Hess in an even bigger deal ($60 billion) that it expects to close this year. That acquisition enhanced its existing operations while adding a new growth driver (Guyana). The company expects it to be accretive to its free cash flow while extending its growth profile into the 2030s. ', ""That drives Chevron's plans to return more cash to shareholders this year. It expects to increase its dividend by another 8% this month (pushing its growth streak to 37 years). That's a higher rate than last year, when it boosted its payment by 6%. "", 'Chevron also anticipates increasing its share repurchase rate by $2.5 billion, pushing it to the top of its $10 billion to $20 billion annual range. That higher buyback will enable Chevron to repurchase more of its beaten-down shares. With its stock price down while free cash flow growth is accelerating, Chevron looks like a bargain buy these days. ', 'Higher interest rates weighed on NextEra Energy stock last year. The clean energy-focused utility slumped 27%, due mainly to slowing growth at its affiliate, NextEra Energy Partners.', ""However, NextEra Energy doesn't see its growth slowing. It reaffirmed its financial expectations through 2026, targeting earnings growth toward the upper end of its 6% to 8% annual range. It also anticipates increasing its dividend by around 10% annually through at least this year. "", ""NextEra Energy has already locked in much of its growth. Government regulators must approve expansion-related investments and rates for its electric utility in Florida. Meanwhile, NextEra's energy resources segment signs long-term contracts supporting its renewable energy and electricity transmission line projects. "", ""The third quarter was the company's best ever for securing new renewable and energy storage projects. It added over 3.2 gigawatts (GWs) to its backlog in the period, which now totals 21 GWs. That's significant, considering that the current operating portfolio of its energy resources segment is a world-leading 34 GWs. "", 'Meanwhile, NextEra should have plenty of power to continue growing beyond 2026. The company estimates that the U.S. needs to invest $4 trillion by 2050 to fully decarbonize the economy by building 26 times its renewable energy capacity at the end of 2022. That massive opportunity should provide NextEra Energy with plenty of growth in the future. ', 'Tellurian believes it can find the partners needed to build its Driftwood project. If it can, the stock could be a big winner. ', ""However, there's a real risk it could fail, which is why investors should avoid its stock like the plague and consider buying Chevron or NextEra Energy instead. They're much more likely to grow in value for their shareholders in the future, making their dips look like compelling buying opportunities."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Tellurian right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Tellurian, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Tellurian wasn't one of them.

In other words, they can provide a solid foundation for a diversified portfolio. As the new year gets underway, you might want to examine NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Black Hills Corporation (NYSE: BKH), and Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) before January is over."", 'If there is one thing that sets NextEra Energy apart from its peers, it is robust dividend growth. Over the past decade, the annualized dividend growth rate for this utility was a huge 10%. That would be a good number for any company, but for a utility it is shockingly strong. Management believes it can continue to grow the dividend at 10% through at least 2024. Earnings are projected to increase at between 6% and 8% a year through at least 2026.', ""There are actually two good stories here. The first accounts for roughly 70% of the business, and that's NextEra's regulated utility operations in Florida, a state that has long benefited from in-migration. More people means more revenue and more need for the capital investments that help justify higher rates to regulators. Slow and steady is the story here."", ""The second story, roughly 30% of the business, is the company's clean energy business, which is one of the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world. This business is the growth engine, with the company expecting to roughly double its capacity by 2026."", ""If you are a dividend growth investor, this is a utility you'll want to own. And the roughly 3% yield is near the highest levels of the past decade, suggesting it is on sale today."", ""The next utility on this list is far less exciting, but that's actually a selling point for the stock. Black Hills is a relatively small utility providing electricity and natural gas to 1.3 million customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The customer base in the regions it serves is growing at nearly three times the rate of the population growth in the United States. That's why slow and steady has been the core story here for a very long time."", ""How long? Well, Black Hills is a Dividend King with 53 consecutive years of annual dividend growth under its belt. That's among the longest streaks of any utility. The average annualized growth rate over the past decade was roughly 5%, which isn't nearly as impressive as NextEra Energy but is still a very solid number. If you are the type of dividend investor focused on dividend consistency, you need to look at Black Hills. And, like NextEra, Black Hills' dividend yield, at around 4.6%, is near its highest levels of the past decade."", 'Dominion Energy is a contrarian pick for those who like a bit of a turnaround story. After selling most of its pipeline assets a few years ago, the utility cut its dividend. But it promised investors that it would get right back on the dividend growth path. Then it announced another business review that would see it sell more assets and refocus around its electricity business.', ""The dividend won't be increased in the near term (falling short of a prior commitment), but management expects to maintain the current payment. All this explains why the stock yields a hefty 5.6% today, well above the utility average of roughly 3.4%, using Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as a proxy."", ""The good news is that Dominion's review is nearly complete, with just one more major step (finding a partner for a large offshore wind project it is working on). That means the company can start looking to a brighter future (again). On the dividend front, the goal is to grow earnings so that the payout ratio falls from an above-peer level back into the peer range. It could take a couple of years to achieve this, but investors will be collecting an above-peer yield along the way, so there's a positive trade-off here to go along with the negative."", ""Although it's not for everyone, Dominion might be a good addition for investors who like trying to find a diamond in the rough. Assuming there are no further business changes (there's not much else to change at this point), a return to dividend growth is the long-term goal here."", ""The utility sector is broad and varied. NextEra, Black Hills, and Dominion are just three companies. But they cover a lot of ground, including dividend growth, dividend consistency, and a bit of a turnaround story. If you take the time to dig into this trio, it is highly likely that you'll want to add at least one of these utilities to your portfolio in January."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

Today, stocks dropped because the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes from December were released and weren't as rosy as the market thought."", 'Shares of renewable energy asset owner NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) fell as much as 5%, SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) fell 11.5%, and Maxeon Solar Technologies (NASDAQ: MAXN) dropped 10.1%. At the market close, shares were down 2.8%, 7.8%, and 5.6%, respectively.', ""After the Federal Reserve's December meeting, investors began speculating on when the central bank would start cutting interest rates. The timeline seemed to move up and there was bullishness about what that would mean for the stock market and renewable energy stocks in particular."", 'Today\'s minutes, which give much more detail about what was discussed, told a different story. Rate increases are not off the table, and the Federal Reserve only thought rates were ""likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle.""', 'It also seemed to indicate that rates could remain at current levels for a long period of time, depending on how the economy does.', 'What the market reacted to in December was a survey of where officials expected rates to be in the future, which largely predicted rates falling. But this was not the consensus or the final policy of the Federal Reserve.', ""Renewable energy investors have been watching interest rates because most projects are financed with debt, so when rates rise it's more costly to develop new projects or refinance old ones. This is what got NextEra Energy Partners in trouble in 2023, but if you look at the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury rate, you can see that rates have been falling for more than two months."", 'So, the narrative today and the reality of the last few months are very different. We even saw the 10-year rate fall 2 basis points in trading today, which would be very bullish for renewable energy stocks long term.', ""Falling rates will be felt in different ways by the industry. For NextEra Energy Partners, lower rates means there's more left for equity investors for existing projects and it may be able to finance more growth projects."", 'SunPower is building and financing residential solar projects that are directly impacted by higher rates through both fewer sales and lower margins. And downstream of that is Maxeon, a SunPower supplier and panel manufacturer focused on the rooftop market.', ""No matter where you sit in the value chain, interest rates impact renewable energy companies and that's why the market is reacting so harshly today. And it doesn't help that the market overall is down and renewable stocks generally magnify the market."", 'But look deeper and you find that rates that matter for borrowing in the renewable market -- like the 10-year -- are down since October and that should be bullish for the industry long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.', 'NextEra Energy Inc., with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and expanding customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are Consolidated Edison Inc., CenterPoint Inc. and NRG Energy Inc.', ""The Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities' earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains steady, regardless of economic cycles. A very hot summer and cold winter season increases demand for electricity."", 'A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. The possibility of an interest rate cut announcement from the Fed in 2024 is going to be a tailwind for capital-intensive utilities.', 'Transition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power: The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity.', ""The passage of the IRA will support and accelerate the utilities' transition toward clean energy sources. It has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for the use of renewable sources. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Per EIA, solar and wind generation together in 2024 will overtake electric power generation from coal for the first year ever, exceeding coal by nearly 90 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh)."", 'Demand and Price for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity supply volumes in the United States will increase 2.4% in 2024 from the 2023 level. A major portion of the electricity will be generated from clean energy sources.', 'EIA predicts the price of electricity to U.S. residential customers in 2024 to average 15.8 cents per kWh, about the same as in 2023, as reduced generation costs are offset by increases in distribution and transmission costs. EIA expects retail electricity prices in the commercial and industrial sectors for 2024 to be relatively unchanged from 2023. The stability in prices and demand are going to boost the prospects of the utilities.', 'Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators.', 'However, in its last three meetings in 2023, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate and indicated the possibility of rate cuts in 2024.

An earlier approval will end Medtronic’s brief PFA monopoly and clear Boston Scientific to start selling a device that is central to its growth plans.', 'Truist Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors that a first-quarter approval for one of Boston Scientific’s “most important new product categories” would increase their confidence in the company’s potential for sales growth of 10% or more.', 'Evidence that PFA could be a safer\xa0way to treat the millions of people in the U.S. with atrial fibrillation (AFib) has fueled predictions that the technology will rapidly replace existing heat-based approaches. The scale of the opportunity has attracted companies including Medtronic, which won the first FDA approval late last year, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson.', 'Boston Scientific presented pivotal data on Farapulse in August, providing the foundation for a filing for FDA approval. By October, the company had completed its submission to the FDA and was expecting to receive a decision in the second half of 2024.\xa0', 'Management updated the timeline in late December, telling investors a decision is now due in the first quarter.

However, we must temper expectations when it comes to AI predictions for the stock market. While AI tools undoubtedly crunch vast amounts of data at speeds no human could match, even the most advanced models lack contextual understanding and reasoning ability.', 'Nonetheless, experimenting with AI for stock analysis can still prove educational. In that spirit, I decided to test drive Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) new natural language model Llama, prompting it to name the top three stocks it expects to outperform in 2024.', 'As with any stock recommendation, skepticism and independent verification is key. Thus, I will be providing my own opinion on these picks below. I expect you to do the same before you choose to invest. Let’s start!', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'I previously recommended Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) near when the stock plunged to $75, punished too harshly amidst broad market turmoil. My thesis — Enphase would recover once conditions improved for the renewable energy industry — has partially played out, with shares bouncing back to the $130s. However, I believe there remains meaningful upside still to capture.', 'Revenue is projected to slip 16.6% next year as near-term headwinds linger. Still, margins should sustain, thanks to Enphase’s technological edge in microinverters. More exciting is the growth trajectory further out. By 2025, analysts forecast a sharp 38% revenue rebound. Enphase is one of few hardware makers simultaneously levered to surging electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the wider clean energy transition.', 'Consider the total addressable market for EV charging infrastructure. With EVs still comprising just 1% of vehicles on roads globally, we’ve only scratched the surface of potential demand. That creates a massive runway for Enphase to supply integrated solar and battery storage systems powering next-gen charging stations.', 'Additionally, while geopolitical instability has sidelined solar projects since 2022, renewable energy remains a long-term priority for policymakers, given climate goals. In the U.S., the recent Inflation Reduction Act extends solar tax credits through 2032. All things considered, I agree with Llama that ENPH can outperform next year.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) likewise endured a steep 38% stock selloff from post-pandemic highs, which I view as overdone, given fundamentals. Shares have recovered just about 16% thus far. The company faces pressure. Revenue has stagnated near $30 billion since 2019 as hospitals delayed elective surgeries during COVID waves. Bottom-line growth also slowed.', 'Yet analysts expect Medtronic’s top line to improve starting next year, averaging 4% annual gains through 2029. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share should bounce back more sharply. Consensus calls for around 10% annual EPS expansion moving forward.', 'So, while headwinds linger, Medtronic’s stock correction overshot rational limits. The quality franchise trades at just 17 times forward earnings. Thus, an earnings-fueled rebound seems likely over the next 12 to 18 months as growth stabilizes. However, tagging Medtronic as a top performer feels like a stretch, given peers with stronger momentum.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been a laggard versus big tech peers and has been unable to impress Wall Street. Shares still sit 6% off highs. However, I’m warming back up to the stock at current levels.', 'No doubt, Alphabet faces pressures — advertising demand fluctuates with budgets while rising costs eroded margins last quarter. Zooming out, revenue and earnings should deliver double-digit growth for years to come. Consensus sees annual top-line and EPS gains both exceeding 10% through 2028, arguing for a higher valuation than the undemanding 24x forward multiple shares currently fetch.', 'Two exciting potential catalysts make me particularly constructive on Alphabet in the long. The first is traction in AI, as Google aims to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT conversational tool using its new Gemini model.', 'The second and nearer-term is ad revenue upside from YouTube’s anti-adblocking efforts. As the globe’s #2 most visited site, YouTube monetizes minimally, given the rampant usage of ad blockers. By restricting extensions that bypass ads, Alphabet could lift sales by making people opt for paid memberships. So, I agree it makes sense to go on your buy list, just not necessarily at the top regarding potential gains.', 'On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In effect, to find deep value stocks, you do research to find something – anything – the market missed and capitalized on the mispricing.', 'The approach, rooted in the principles popularized by the legendary investor Benjamin Graham and touted by Warren Buffer and others, seeks out stocks trading for less than their “true” worth due to market factors like temporary setbacks, market overreactions, or general investor bearishness. Deep value investors focus on financial and fundamental analysis to find stocks that are both undervalued and fundamentally sound. The ultimate goal is to capitalize on hidden, overlooked market inefficiencies by buying stocks on sale before waiting for markets to realize their mistake.', 'In many ways, deep value investing is a thing of the past. When Graham and his proteges were learning the ropes, digging into financial filings was a rarer and more esoteric form of fundamental analysis. Today’s digitization means markets price companies to the minute, leaving less room for true undervaluation.

Earlier in the year, the company faced challenges as speculation grew about the IRS possibly launching a free national tax filing service. But HRB has since recovered impressively and is now strategically poised to dominate the tax return sector and capitalize on various other revenue-generating opportunities.', 'HRB introduced a mobile banking service at the beginning of the year to offset the seasonal nature of its tax-related revenue. By April, this initiative had already attracted significant customer interest, with 291,000 users onboard and a collective deposit of over $280 million. Moreover, the company’s small-business accounting service witnessed a 10% year-over-year increase. These strategic moves are point to strong efforts to stabilize cash flow, a common challenge for tax-focused firms, to ensure a more consistent revenue stream throughout the year.', 'In addition to these developments, HRB is also making waves with its dividend policy.

The general market buzz around Nintendo intensified recently, especially amid rumors of a collaboration with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The potential partnership, which remains unconfirmed, suggests the duo may be developing a next-gen VR headset platform.', 'Adding to the intrigue, leaked emails from a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) court case indicate Microsoft’s significant interest in partnering with or acquiring Nintendo. Although these emails date back to 2020 and no concrete developments transpired, they highlight the considerable corporate interest in Nintendo. This positions Nintendo favorably for leveraging its brand and assets for substantial growth in 2024. And, of course, we can’t forget the impact of the upcoming Zelda movie on Nintendo’s franchising opportunities.', 'Nintendo’s financial management is also top-notch. Praised for its sound management in the Microsoft emails, the company currently has a substantial cash reserve. This financial strength puts Nintendo in a solid position to navigate economic uncertainties and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Additionally, its current total yield of 2.81% appeals to deep value investors, offering a steady return while they await the stock’s eventual repricing.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT), a top-tier medical device manufacturer, is a prime choice among healthcare stocks for deep value divers. Despite a relatively flat performance throughout most of this year, shares ticked higher this month. Today, the stock is set up for a 5% total gain this year. But, looking ahead, the company’s 2024 prospects outweigh its modest performance – and make its current stock price an ideal entry point for investors.', 'Medtronic’s latest earnings report points to a solid growth trajectory post-pandemic (unlike many healthcare stocks) as it hit a 6% increase in revenue year-over-year. But, moving forward, Medtronic’s innovation alongside deep value tendencies point to the greatest upside.', 'Medtronic’s future potentiality lies in its ventures into artificial intelligence in healthcare. The collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), initiated in early 2023 to develop AI-driven platform solutions, should reach wide market usage by 2024. This holds promise for investors who have remained patient through the stock’s recent stagnation.', 'Medtronic’s current dividend yield of 3.57% further solidifies its status as a compelling deep value stock, offering both stability and potential for growth as we move into the new year.', 'On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

No, it’s not a sexy industry – far from it. More than likely, most of us would rather have zero hands-on experience with this sector. Nevertheless, it’s a dirty job that requires addressing. Otherwise, the economy could quite literally crumble to a halt.', 'According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) tipped the scales at 292.4 million tons in 2018.

Since the beginning of the year, Republic shares jumped more than 27%. Part of the reason for the enhanced enthusiasm is the company’s earnings performances. Consistently, Republic tops estimates for earnings per share. And it usually beats on revenue too.', 'In contrast, WM has been hit or miss in the past few quarters, which may raise some eyebrows.

The FDA’s main review office approved 55 novel drugs, the most since 2018, while the agency’s biologics division cleared 15 more. The clearances offer some counterbalance to a prolonged market downturn, during which the sector has struggled with a range of financial and regulatory headwinds.', 'The next three months could bring more important FDA news.

Also on deck are verdicts for a drug at the heart of a multibillion dollar buyout and a linchpin asset for one biotech’s oncology plans.', 'Here are five decisions to watch in the first quarter, along with a review that merits close attention:', 'Early in September, Lilly’s market capitalization eclipsed $500 billion, an extraordinary mark that made it the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.', 'The run-up in Lilly’s valuation, which rose by almost 50% in less than six months, was driven by the success of tirzepatide, a drug approved for diabetes and weight loss. Tirzepatide puts Lilly at the front of a revolution in how obesity, a condition affecting some 40% of U.S. adults, is treated.', 'But part of Lilly’s formidable valuation is due to the company’s leading position in treating another prevalent scourge: Alzheimer’s disease. The company, which for years tried unsuccessfully to develop a treatment, finally succeeded with a drug called donanemab. Phase 3 testing showed that it could modestly slow the mental and physical decline due to Alzheimer’s.', 'The results will make donanemab — if approved by the FDA this quarter as expected — a competitor to Eisai and Biogen’s rival Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi. Analysts view donanemab as a potentially superior treatment, but Lilly will face the same questions around cost and benefit as Eisai and Biogen have with Leqembi.', 'If donanemab wins over regulators, insurers and doctors, Lilly could be a leader in treating two of this century’s greatest health threats. — Ned Pagliarulo', 'Few diseases have confounded drugmakers over the last decade more than metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, a condition previously called NASH. Multiple large firms have seen promising prospects fail in testing. And the first drug developer to reach regulatory review — Intercept Pharmaceuticals — was rejected twice by the FDA and subsequently abandoned its efforts.', 'Madrigal Pharmaceuticals could succeed where others failed. Positive results from a Phase 3 study in 2022 have put the company on the precipice of bringing the first drug to market for MASH, a condition estimated to affect millions of people. Its drug resmetirom, which could be approved by March 14, is supported by data that industry watchers see as more convincing than Intercept’s.', 'Analysts at the investment bank Piper Sandler, for instance, called Madrigal’s filing the most “comprehensive clinical data package” in MASH to date. “We think this drives a compelling risk/benefit profile to the FDA,” they wrote in a report last month.', 'If approved, resmestirom’s launch will be closely watched. The commercial prospects of MASH drugs have long been debated, as the disease often goes undiagnosed for years and some of its symptoms can be combated with diet and exercise. Analysts are also unsure whether the FDA or insurers will require patients get a liver biopsy before treatment, which would limit uptake.', 'What’s more, popular weight loss drugs known as GLP-1 agonists are also being tested in NASH, making them potential rivals to Madrigal and others following in its footsteps. One study of Lilly’s drug tirzepatide could produce results before the FDA issues a verdict on resmetirom. — Ben Fidler ', 'In recent years, Merck has reprioritized cardiovascular disease research. An important step forward could come this quarter, should the FDA approve a drug known as sotatercept.', 'Sotatercept was originally developed by Acceleron Pharma and was once the focus of a partnership between the biotechnology company and Celgene before research was halted. The drug was revived when it showed promise in pulmonary arterial hypertension, a common and deadly type of high blood pressure in the lungs. Its progress led Merck to acquire Acceleron for $11.5 billion in 2021.', 'Positive Phase 3 study results Merck has since obtained could yield a “new direction” in treating PAH, a group of physicians wrote in an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Merck is counting on it, both to justify its investment in Acceleron and help replace the revenue it’ll lose when its lucrative cancer drug Keytruda goes off patent in 2028.', 'Yet sotatercept faces a crowded market with multiple other drugs and would-be competitors close behind, leading to questions about its commercial potential. On a conference call last year, Merck management claimed a “bolus of patients is closely waiting” for the drug’s approval. That confidence led Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch to suggest in December that sotatercept is one of the company’s “more underappreciated opportunities.”', 'The FDA will make a decision by March 26. — Ben Fidler ', 'In the late 1980s, a team of researchers led by the National Cancer Institute’s Steven Rosenberg explored whether a form of personalized cell therapy could be used to treat aggressive cancers like melanoma.', 'The technique they pioneered, which became known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL, therapy, has taken a circuitous journey in the 35-odd years since. While early attempts were inconsistent, subsequent testing has shown TIL therapy can shrink advanced tumors and even outperform other drugs.', 'By mid-February, the FDA will decide whether to approve the first industrialized TIL therapy, which was developed by Iovance for advanced melanoma.', 'Iovance’s own journey to get to this point has been prolonged by delays and last month the FDA halted testing of a separate Iovance TIL therapy in lung cancer. Analysts expect the melanoma review to remain on track, but the hold adds some new uncertainty to the FDA’s decision.', 'If approval is granted, Iovance will be under pressure to deliver. The company’s TIL therapy, called lifileucel, involves a bespoke manufacturing process that takes about three weeks. — Ned Pagliarulo', 'Regeneron has spent years trying to build a cancer drug business, but with mixed results. Though the company successfully developed a cancer immunotherapy, Libtayo, it was the sixth of its type to win U.S. approval. Libtayo sales are dwarfed by those of competitors, like Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, that bring in billions of dollars each year.', 'Regeneron is looking to a newer set of dual-acting drugs, known as bispecific antibodies, to better compete. The company has a pair in advanced testing for blood cancers and one, odronextamab, could be approved for follicular and diffuse large B cell lymphoma by the end of March.', 'From there, the company plans to develop combinations that are more potent while running tests in earlier treatment settings, executives have said.', 'But Regeneron is again trailing the competition, leading to skepticism from analysts that the drugs will be major revenue drivers. The FDA has already cleared multiple bispecific drugs for lymphoma that work similarly to odronextamab, for instance, and Regeneron hasn’t proven its drug is superior.', '“It remains to be seen how the adoption of [odronextamab] will compare,” wrote William Blair analyst Matt Phipps, in a December research note. — Ben Fidler ', 'Last year, the FDA made Sarepta’s gene therapy the first of its kind cleared for the progressive, muscle-wasting condition. But the approval was limited to a specific group of young boys who can still walk, and conditioned on the therapy succeeding in a confirmatory clinical trial. That study failed to hit its main goal in October, leaving Elevidys’ future unclear.', 'Sarepta claims that, despite the setback, there were enough encouraging findings to warrant the FDA expanding Elevidys’ clearance. While treatment didn’t lead to a meaningful difference over a placebo on a widely used test of motor function, Sarepta said treated patients consistently benefited on a variety of other measures.', 'Sarepta’s application to broaden Elevidys’ use is another test of the FDA’s flexibility in reviewing drugs for deadly conditions like Duchenne. The agency approved Elevidys despite questions about its benefits and previously indicated it may consider removing the drug from the market if the confirmatory study failed. But the regulator faces pressure from patient groups to act quickly, and some of its top officials have been closely involved in Elevidys’ review.', ""“Given the totality of the data, our understanding of the agency's interactions with Sarepta up until this point, and the unmet need in [Duchenne], we continue to believe that Elevidys will remain on the market with an expanded label,” wrote Leerink Partners analyst Joseph Schwartz, in December."", 'Sarepta has asked for a priority review, which, if accepted by the FDA, would begin a six-month evaluation. The FDA could decide whether to accept the request by late February. — Ben Fidler ', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.3%, which is fairly typical for the industry."", ' View our latest analysis for Mosaic ', ""We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, Mosaic's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 16.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 21%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.00 total annually to $0.84. The dividend has shrunk at around 1.7% a year during that period. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Mosaic has impressed us by growing EPS at 51% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future."", ""Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Mosaic is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Mosaic (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.

It is a smart weapon that can autonomously detect and classify moving targets in poor visibility situations caused by darkness, bad weather, smoke, or dust kicked up by helicopters. StormBreaker's small size enables the use of fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as larger weapons that require multiple jets.

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani here with the details. The shares down almost 2%. And this is a reversal, right, for Cigna?"", 'ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah. Well, we also-- we do know that they had been looking to offload that. That was part of the conversation, if you remember, at the end of last year when they were looking to combine with Humana, one of the largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans. In fact, UnitedHealth and Humana combined are 47% of that market just alone. So just to tell you where Humana stands in that conversation.', ""But going back to what Cigna gets from this, they're looking to offload their Medicare Advantage business and what could be up to a $4 billion deal according to Wall Street Journal with Health Care Services Corp and that is a Blue Cross Blue Shield provider that operates in five states in the country, including Texas and Illinois. So large populations there."", ""They've also been on a growing streak. They've had the last three years of just growth in their Medicare Advantage business. 2024 marks the third consecutive year there. And they serve 18.6 million people. So that's a very large population that they have in the books. And this kind of speaks to how Medicare Advantage is just kind of growing as a business per se. But for Cigna, it doesn't have as large a share of that. It's just about 2% of the market. So that might be why a little bit."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And why is Cigna offloading the Medicare Advantage business now? Is there a reason at this moment it makes more sense?', ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah. Medicare Advantage, while it is a profitable business based on Humana and UnitedHealth alone, as you can see on your screen, the Blue Cross plans have about 14% of that business, so it's a good fit there, they have been under a lot of pressure. Medicare Advantage has come under the government's microscope for overcharging, delaying, or denying care. They've had hospitals drop plans because of these practices, because they feel like these patients aren't really worth the struggle to get paid."", ""And so we've had some of these problems with Medicare Advantage pop up since 2022. Up until then, it was kind of on a growing streak. In the last six years alone, you kind of saw that growth 51% of Medicare eligible enrollees are on a Medicare Advantage plan. And that's up from 19% in 2007. So you can see that growth. You saw how it works."", ""And the way that Medicare Advantage works is that these insurers basically get a set price per patient. And they get to profit off of that if they don't use as much of that money. So that's where the bonus is, right? That's where it's-- but that's exactly the thing that has landed them in hot water.

Upgrading its network to support 5G download speeds is increasing wireless revenue, encouraging users to consume more data (data is what generates the juiciest margins for the company's wireless segment), and bolstering its aggregate number of broadband customers."", 'AT&T has also made remarkable progress with its balance sheet. Since March 2022, the company has spun off content arm WarnerMedia, which was merged with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery. This new entity took control of certain debt lots previously held by AT&T. Including organic pay-down, AT&T has reduced its net debt by more than $40 billion to $128.7 billion.', ""One of my 10 stock market predictions for 2024 is that we'll witness what's currently the second-longest yield-curve inversion on record come to an end. A combination of dovish Federal Reserve monetary policy, coupled with a normalization of the yield curve, is an ideal environment for mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY)."", 'The mortgage REIT operating model involves borrowing money at short-term rates and using this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities. If interest rates decline in the new year, and the yield curve normalizes, short-term borrowing costs will fall and companies like Annaly will enjoy a higher net interest margin.', 'Additionally, Annaly Capital Management almost exclusively purchases agency assets. Agency securities are backed by the federal government in the event of default. What this added protection does is give Annaly the liberty of utilizing leverage to support its whopping 13.4% dividend yield.', 'A fifth unsurpassed stock that has a history of making its shareholders richer is healthcare company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). Based on total returns, which includes dividends paid, UnitedHealth Group has made its shareholders money in 20 of the past 22 years.', ""Most people are familiar with UnitedHealth because of the company's health insurance segment. Even though the Affordable Care Act has sapped some of the premium pricing power for health insurers in the individual market, UnitedHealth is doing just fine with its employer-based plans and within the individual marketplace."", 'Subsidiary Optum is an even bigger growth driver for UnitedHealth.

China\'s regulators abandoned the stringent and highly controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy in December 2022. Though it\'s taking a while for China\'s once-dominant economy to ramp up, there remains a lengthy runway for e-commerce expansion. Alibaba\'s online shopping sites, Taobao and Tmall, account for about 51% of China\'s e-commerce market, per the International Trade Administration.', 'On top of being an e-commerce leader, Alibaba is also the clear No. 1 in cloud infrastructure services in China.

Three years ago, the average active account was completing 40.9 transactions on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. As of the end of the third quarter (Sept. 30, 2023), active accounts were nearing 57 transactions completed over the TTM. Since PayPal is predominantly a fee-driven platform, increasing the aggregate number of transactions is the easiest way to grow its gross profit.', ""We're also witnessing purposeful belt-tightening and shareholder-friendly moves being made by new CEO Alex Chriss and the company's board. PayPal was targeting $1.3 billion in annual operating cost reductions in 2023, and it looks to be on track to purchase around $5 billion worth of its own stock.

High-octane dividend stocks like Altria Group (NYSE: MO), which sports a yield of nearly 10%, can make you richer this year."", ""The biggest issue for tobacco stocks is that as consumers have become aware of the long-term dangers of tobacco use, fewer adults have taken up the habit. Thankfully for Altria, the company behind leading premium cigarette brand Marlboro, it holds exceptional pricing power with existing smokers. Even if cigarette shipments decline, Altria's ability to raise prices can move both its sales and earnings per share higher."", ""Altria Group is expanding into smokeless products as well. In June 2023, it closed a $2.75 billion deal to acquire electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings.

With ad dollars shifting to digital channels, it's companies like PubMatic, which help publishers sell their digital display space, that will benefit."", ""What's often overlooked with PubMatic is that the company chose to design and develop its cloud-based infrastructure instead of relying on a third-party platform.

Furthermore, it can organically or acquisitively move its payment infrastructure into the Middle East, Southeastern Asia, and Africa in the coming years and decades to sustain a double-digit growth rate.', ""Visa's success is also a function of its focus on payment processing.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is PYPL Worth Investing In?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Paypal, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.98.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.

However, the tech promises to speed the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) which is one of the reasons that it is garnering a lot of attention at the moment. The further development of those applications has the potential to multiply investor capital.', 'Source: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com', 'IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is one of the leading names in the quantum computing space. The stock became publicly available in 2021 via a SPAC merger. IonQ was the first pure-play quantum computing company to become publicly available to investors.

IonQ’s Aria quantum computer is available through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS’ quantum computing service called Braket. At launch, the service was available for 15 hours daily. It allows users to undertake highly technical work including the testing of quantum circuits, for example.', 'Likewise, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has published information relating to its partnership with IonQ as it relates to the company’s Azure cloud offerings.

Its stock is almost always a reasonable choice for investors and for those interested in quantum computing Google also makes sense.', 'I should also caveat that GOOG shares realistically won’t 10X in value without a very long timeline. The company is simply too large. It is forecast to perhaps 3X by 2025. If, in the future, Alphabet decides to spin off a quantum computing division as a stand alone stock that would be a different story. For now, understand that Google’s quantum computing efforts are but one more reason to consider investing overall.', 'The company has developed a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. That lab was developed and is operated jointly with NASA and the Universities Space Research Association. The project is essentially an open source library with multiple applications across fields that touch on quantum computing. It includes Cirq, a library that leverages python computer language and Quantum Computing for the purpose of creating quantum circuits. Further, it includes other software that allows for the development of things like quantum chemistry and the application of quantum Computing to Fields including machine learning that are very important today.', 'That said, Google isn’t focusing strictly on the software side and also has quantum computing hardware available.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'IBM (NYSE:IBM) currently offers quantum computing services primarily through its New York data center.

IBM boasts more than 10 utility scale Quantum systems globally at present. Quantum systems are modular and can be extended and can connect multiple systems for greater power.', 'For example, in 2021 IBM installed one of its Quantum systems at the Cleveland Clinic. That kicked off the beginning of a 10-year relationship in which IBM will help leverage its technological know-how to solve problems in healthcare. That installation should also serve to inform investors of just how wide-ranging Quantum computing is in its applications. Essentially, it’s all about the ability to access greater volumes of data at higher speeds. That’s the promise of quantum computing and it’s certainly very applicable in data rich fields such as healthcare.

The annual consumer electronics trade show, which runs from Jan. 9 through Jan. 12, serves as a showcase for the biggest technology trends that will likely make their way into our lives.', 'Over the years that’s included everything from high-end vehicle infotainment systems and 4K, OLED TVs to electric scooters and new computer chips. Of course, there’s also the collection of oddities that flood the show’s various booths and displays. Think talking toilets and forks that tell you if you’re eating too fast.', 'And CES 2024 looks set to pack even more of the equal parts impressive and downright confounding products that will end up in our living rooms and driveways in the months and years to come. Naturally, Yahoo Finance will be live on the ground in Sin City, weaving through the thousands of attendees to bring you all of the latest news from the big show.', 'So, what can you expect out of CES 2024? Funny you should ask…', 'The AI revolution that dominated headlines in 2023 will continue to roll on in 2024.You can expect everyone from chipmakers and automotive companies to TV manufacturers and more to talk up the benefits of AI during the big show.', 'One of the biggest themes is likely to be based around the AI PC. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each debuted their own AI PC chips in recent months, with Intel showing off its Core Ultra AI PC processors in December.', 'The idea behind AI PCs is to add AI processing capabilities to laptop and desktop chips so that users can run AI applications on their own computers rather than in the cloud. The thinking is that if you need to run sensitive data like personal information or corporate files through an AI program, doing so on your computer is safer than sending them up to the cloud.', 'But beyond that, companies are still trying to figure out how AI PCs will benefit most people. During Intel’s December AI Everywhere event, company representatives said that it’ll be up to developers to come up with new apps and programs that take advantage of new AI PC features.', 'Chipmakers won’t be the only companies focusing on AI. Automakers, retailers, and home appliance manufacturers will undoubtedly explain how they’re using AI to power their latest and greatest products.', 'AI will likely be so ubiquitous at CES 2024 that it’ll be strange if a company doesn’t mention the technology. Heck, Samsung says that it’s bringing AI to its kitchen appliances, including its refrigerators.', 'It’s cliche to say that CES is as much a car show as it is a technology event. Automakers from across the world pack the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center with their hottest cars, trucks, SUVs, and, occasionally, flying cars, filling the air with the smell of fresh rubber and the promise of a future where you can watch TV while your vehicle chauffeurs you around town.', 'In past years companies ranging from Ford (F) and BMW to Hyundai (HYMTF) and Chevy (GM) have debuted new in-car technologies designed to improve the driving experience. Last year BMW revealed a concept for a customizable kind of paint job that you can adjust at any time. That same year, Sony (SONY) and Honda (HMC) unveiled their concept car Afeela. This year Sony Honda Mobility will be back with a prototype of the Afeela.', 'As for the flying cars, Uber (UBER) and Hyundai teamed up to announce their flying taxi at CES 2020. This year Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Air Mobility company, Supernal, will take the wraps off of its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle complete with a vertiport exhibit that will showcase how passengers will ride in the flying concept.', 'TVs are a mainstay of CES. They’re also my favorite part of the show. Where else can you see every next-generation television you’ll beg your spouse to get in one place?', 'The biggest trend in TVs is microLED technology, which promises the color of OLED sets with the brightness of LED systems. So far, however, those TVs have been incredibly expensive, with prices in the tens of thousands of dollars. But that’s expected to come down over time, and could eventually become relatively affordable for the average consumer.', 'TVs are also getting more AI capabilities, as well. LG announced on Jan. 3 that its latest OLED TVs will feature updated AI processors that improve image and sound quality. The company also said that its wireless television, which it debuted at CES 2023, will now be available with a smaller 65-inch screen. There’s also a larger 97-inch model that, well, just won’t fit in my Queens apartment.', 'One of the best parts of CES is seeing so many wild, attention-grabbing products in one place. Some of them are practical, like leak detectors for under your kitchen sink and Wi-Fi-enabled meat thermometers that send you an alert on your phone when your steak is ready. Some aren’t so practical; I’m looking at you, electric roller skates.', 'I’ve seen more weird gadgets and gizmos over the years than I can count, and CES 2024 will be no different.

This favorable sentiment is supported by healthy economic indicators, increased spending on experiences and a growing preference for cruising.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'In 2024, RCL anticipates promising growth due to its strong booking position, fleet expansion and enhanced commercial capabilities.

During the third quarter, total cruise operating expenses were $2.14 billion compared with $1.97 billion in the year-ago quarter. The upside was mainly driven by a rise in food, fuel and onboard expenses. Also, operations at additional capacity and higher occupancy added to the downside. Moving ahead, the company anticipates inflationary and supply chain challenges (mainly related to fuel and food costs) will persist for some time.

(NYSE:VZ) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Verizon Communications' shares before the 9th of January in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.67 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.66 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Verizon Communications has a trailing yield of 6.8% on the current share price of $39.16. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Verizon Communications can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Verizon Communications paid out more than half (53%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 80% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth."", ""It's positive to see that Verizon Communications's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Verizon Communications's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 7.6% a year over the previous five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Verizon Communications has lifted its dividend by approximately 2.6% a year on average. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Verizon Communications? It's never good to see earnings per share shrinking, but at least the dividend payout ratios appear reasonable. We're aware though that if earnings continue to decline, the dividend could be at risk. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being."", ""Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Verizon Communications.

Not surprisingly, investors have been buying AI stocks hand over fist over the past year to take advantage of this huge end-market opportunity.', 'More importantly, the massive economic potential of AI suggests that buying and holding solid AI stocks for a really long time could give investors impressive returns, as they will be able to benefit from the power of compounding while capitalizing on a rapidly growing market.', ""That's why if you have investible cash of $200,000 after paying your bills, clearing high-interest loans, and saving enough for bad times, it may be a good idea to put that money into shares of both Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW). These stocks could help you become a millionaire, or at least get close to that milestone, as part of a diversified portfolio. Let's see how."", ""Nvidia has seen a big surge in demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) thanks to AI, leading to eye-popping growth in the company's revenue and earnings in recent quarters. The market has rewarded Nvidia's impressive growth with solid gains, which explains how the stock would have turned a $200,000 investment into $659,000 in the past year."", ""However, a closer look at Nvidia's AI-related opportunity indicates that the company is just getting started. Market research provider IDTechEx estimates that the market for AI chips could generate $258 billion in annual revenue in 2033, growing at an annual rate of 24% over the next decade."", ""Nvidia's market share of more than 80% in AI chips means that it is in a prime position to make the most of this multibillion-dollar market opportunity. The company's revenue tripled year over year in the last reported quarter to $18.1 billion as its data center revenue shot up 279% to $14.5 billion."", 'Nvidia is taking steps to ensure that it maintains its dominant position in this market by accelerating its product roadmap and increasing chip supply, which could help ensure robust growth in the years to come.', ""Assuming Nvidia manages to control even 50% of the AI chip market in a decade, its data center revenue could jump to almost $130 billion based on IDTechEx's estimate of the size of this market in 2033. That would be a huge jump over the $15 billion revenue Nvidia's data center business generated in fiscal 2023."", ""There are also other catalysts that could send the company's top and bottom lines soaring in the long run, such as the AI-enabled personal computer (PC) market, cloud gaming, digital twins, and automotive. This explains why Nvidia's earnings are expected to clock annual growth of 102% over the next five years, up significantly from the 48% annual earnings growth it clocked in the last five years."", 'A $200,000 investment made in Nvidia stock five years ago would now be worth almost $2.9 million. Given that the company is expected to deliver even faster earnings growth over the next five years, there is a chance that it may be able to replicate its sizzling rally, deliver outstanding returns to investors, and even help them become millionaires.', 'Snowflake provides a cloud-based data platform that gives customers access to multiple functions such as data warehousing, data lakes, data science, data engineering, and secure sharing on a single interface. You may be wondering how Snowflake is going to benefit from the AI boom, but the cloud-based services that Snowflake provides could witness a jump in adoption thanks to AI.', ""That's because training large language models (LLMs) requires access to massive amounts of data. For example, the amount of data needed to train ChatGPT and GPT-4 LLMs reportedly exceeded 45 terabytes (TB). As a result, having access to high-quality data for training LLMs is crucial. This is where Snowflake steps in."", 'In June 2023, Nvidia announced that it was partnering with Snowflake to allow businesses to ""create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud."" The ability of enterprises to create custom LLMs using their own data to speed up their business processes in a secure environment could open up a new growth opportunity for Snowflake.', ""A survey of more than 300 businesses and AI experts by enterprise AI company Expert.AI in April 2023 revealed that almost 40% of the respondents were planning to build custom enterprise LLMs. This illustrates why demand for Snowflake's data platform could increase, especially considering that it has taken steps to help enterprises build LLMs in a cost-effective manner with the Snowflake Cortex platform."", ""Snowflake customers who stored their data on the company's platform can use Cortex, a fully managed offering, to extract information from unstructured data, translate text, summarize documents, and build custom applications quickly. Enterprises are getting access to this facility without having to invest in expensive hardware, which is all the more reason why the demand for Snowflake's offerings could increase."", 'Not surprisingly, Snowflake expects its addressable market to increase rapidly in the long run. The company was sitting on a total addressable market (TAM) worth $140 billion in 2022. It expects this market to more than double to $290 billion in 2027. It is worth noting that Snowflake has generated $2.6 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, so it is scratching the surface of a huge opportunity.', ""The company is expected to finish the current fiscal year with $2.8 billion in revenue, up 35% from the prior year. Snowflake's earnings are forecast to more than triple in fiscal 2024 to $0.80 per share. As the following chart shows, Snowflake's top and bottom lines could keep heading higher in the next couple of fiscal years as well."", ""What's more, analysts are forecasting Snowflake's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 66% over the next five years. At this pace, the company's earnings could hit $10 per share in fiscal 2029. Multiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100 index's (which is used as a proxy for tech stocks) price-to-earnings ratio of 30 points toward a stock price of $300, which would be a 58% jump from current levels."", 'However, Snowflake is trading at 175 times forward earnings right now. It could maintain a premium valuation in five years thanks to its impressive growth and a new catalyst in the form of AI.

But I'm passing once again on this data center and enterprise compute manufacturer. Here are three reasons why."", ""Super Micro's head of steam has been building thanks to generative AI. Chip companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been tapping the manufacturer to assemble servers (a powerful computer that gets installed in a data center or business office) that power AI applications. It's also getting in on the Arm Holdings data center server game and has a new lineup of servers using chip design start-up Ampere Computing Arm-based chips."", 'Super Micro just upgraded its revenue guidance for 2024, with expectations for it to be in a range between $10 billion and $11 billion -- versus $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion before. The dramatic rise thanks to AI is especially clear when viewing sales over the last five years. Super Micro was hauling in only a few billion dollars in revenue just three years ago.', 'However, Super Micro competes against many other companies that design and assemble servers and storage devices on behalf of its semiconductor design and manufacturing partners. Competitors include Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and a growing presence in the server market from equipment and design manufacturers in Asia like Foxconn and Inspur.', ""All these peers are also sitting on a massive generative AI opportunity. Super Micro is clearly a standout as it has gone from a small and relatively unknown company to a hot stock riding the AI wave. But I can't ignore the hotly competitive field that Super Micro battles in."", 'At this point, given the sustained growth Super Micro is expecting, many investors are drawn to the cheap valuation -- especially when comparing it to the premium price chip stocks like Nvidia and AMD are fetching these days.', 'Indeed, Super Micro could be a great long-term value right now. Shares trade for 26 times trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS), but only 16 times expected EPS for fiscal 2024. That compares to the respective 24 and 27 times expected EPS for Nvidia and AMD for next year.', ""However, Super Micro's growth is not coming from its own efforts. Rather, it's riding the coattails of others, primarily leaders in semiconductor design, as it makes hay from the AI movement. No matter how you slice it, Super Micro is dependent on ultimate sales of AI servers powered by partners like Nvidia and AMD, making it a type of derivative bet on those businesses' performance. That's a big reason for the relative discount on Super Micro stock."", 'Nevertheless, Super Micro is raking in the chips thanks to AI, and its stock is a relative value. So why not just buy?', ""For me, it's all about the business model. Super Micro is not in full control of its own destiny. It could be very cheap if growth"", ""continues, but that growth and resulting profitability will be dependent on chip design partners Nvidia, AMD, and the like -- and less on Super Micro's own execution. Again, by Super Micro's own admission in its financial filings, it has limited ability to stave off competitors over the long term. In the last annual filing, Super Micro said the following (italics inserted by me):"", 'We seek to protect our intellectual property rights with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and disclosure restrictions. We rely primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how, and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our design and product development activities.', ""In other words, the majority of Super Micro's work has no patent protection, which is a key item I look for when investing in hardware-based businesses (like semiconductor stocks). Although Super Micro certainly has its own proprietary way of designing and assembling enterprise computing and storage systems, few of those processes are granted patent and intellectual property (IP) protection. Again, by Super Micro's own admission in its last annual filing:"", ""Our industry is marked by a large number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violation of intellectual property rights. Our primary competitors have substantially greater numbers of issued patents than we have which may position us less favorably in the event of any claims or litigation with them. Other third parties have in the past sent us correspondence regarding their intellectual property or filed claims that our products infringe or violate third parties' intellectual property rights. In addition, increasingly non-operating companies are purchasing patents and bringing claims against technology companies. We have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to such claims in the future."", 'When looking for a long-term investment in AI, and in whatever other mega trends lie ahead for the greater IT sector, I can\'t say ""yes"" to owning every stock. This kind of risk and lack of competitive differentiation inherent in Super Micro\'s business model just doesn\'t cut it for me. Besides, I already own ample shares of Nvidia, AMD, and data center design leader Arista Networks, so buying Super Micro would offer little in the form of portfolio diversification for me.', ""I understand the draw to Super Micro stock as 2024 gets underway, and the swarm of investors betting on the company could be right in assuming it will be a big beneficiary from the AI movement. But as for me, I'm passing on Super Micro stock again in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

Intel has gained a small foothold, but only in the budget portion of the market. The company's issues with buggy software drivers, particularly soon after launch, have likely driven some gamers away."", ""Intel's first generation of graphics cards made no attempt to compete with Nvidia and AMD at higher price points. The Arc A750 sells today for around $210, and the Arc A770 goes for around $320, although prices have dipped lower at times. These cards are competitive for the price, although performance can be inconsistent due to nagging driver issues."", 'Helping Intel in 2023 were lackluster mid-range graphics card launches from both Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia\'s RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti came with limitations and high price tags. Tom\'s Hardware concluded that the priciest variant was ""overpriced for what you get, much like most of the rest of Nvidia\'s current RTX 40-series lineup.""', ""AMD's efforts weren't much better. The RX 7600 wasn't much of an upgrade over previous models, and the value proposition, compared to last-gen products, was weak, even after a last-minute price cut."", ""While Nvidia is expected to roll out a product refresh soon, genuinely new mid-range graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD likely won't be coming until 2025. The gap between Nvidia's RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 was more than two years, and the RTX 4060 has only been on the market since mid-2023. AMD may fill in some gaps in its lineup in 2024, but next-generation products are likely a ways off."", ""Intel's next-generation graphics cards, codenamed Battlemage, are expected to arrive sometime in 2024. With Battlemage, Intel is expected to move up into the enthusiast portions of the market that its first-generation products avoided. While Intel probably won't be going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's highest-end products, Battlemage should appeal to a broader swath of gamers."", ""Intel proved with its first-generation products that it can produce capable graphics hardware. With its second-generation products, it must prove that it's committed enough to the market to continually improve its software and eliminate the bugs and inconsistencies that have been holding it back."", ""Jon Peddie Research expects the market for discrete graphics cards to grow to $39 billion by 2026. That estimate was thrown out in late 2022 before the artificial intelligence (AI) bonanza caused demand for data center GPUs to explode. Considering just the market for graphics cards aimed at gaming, however, that's likely still a reasonable estimate."", ""In addition to winning a portion of the graphics card market, Intel's increased work on graphics can benefit it in other ways. The company's Meteor Lake CPUs, which launched in December for laptops, feature revamped integrated GPUs that deliver enormous performance gains. One set of benchmarks, for example, shows a 33% performance gain and a doubling of power efficiency over previous-generation models. Intel has long lagged AMD in terms of integrated graphics performance, but that gap now appears to be closing."", ""While Intel's initial graphics card launch didn't go smoothly, the software situation has greatly improved over the past year.

So when the market crashes, plenty of investors panic and hastily abandon their original plans for a holding a stock for decades until they retire. That panic selling often causes investors to miss out on some massive long-term gains, so it\'s generally a better idea to sit tight through downturns or buy more shares to reduce your average purchase price through dollar-cost averaging.', 'However, that strategy works only for well-run companies that are built to last for decades. I believe Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) fit that description -- and that both stocks could be great long-term retirement plays.', ""Nvidia is the world's top producer of gaming and data center GPUs. Its stock has already soared 12,270% over the past 10 years as the PC gaming and artificial intelligence (AI) markets expanded -- but it could still have room to run. Nvidia controls more than 80% of the discrete GPU market for high-end gaming, according to JPR, putting it far ahead of its largest competitor AMD. Nvidia also dominates the market for high-end GPUs in data centers -- where they're used to accelerate complex AI tasks. That's why all of the world's top AI platforms, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, currently use Nvidia's top-tier chips."", ""Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and EPS to grow at compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 59% and 131%, respectively, from fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023) to fiscal 2026. That breakneck growth should mainly be driven by the long-term expansion of the AI market, which Grand View Research expects to expand at a CAGR of 37% from 2023 to 2030, but its gaming business should also recover quickly as the PC market stabilizes."", ""Those growth rates look remarkable for a stock that trades at 27 times next year's earnings. However, Nvidia's stock is currently being held back by concerns regarding the new U.S. trade restrictions which are barring it from shipping its higher-end AI chips to China, as well as the development of first-party AI chips at top customers like OpenAI."", ""Those concerns are certainly valid, but I believe Nvidia can offset its lost sales in China with its growth in other markets. I also think it will take years, if not decades, for first-party chips to develop AI accelerator chips that can properly replace Nvidia's GPUs. Unless that happens, Nvidia will remain the top play on the growing gaming and AI markets."", 'Nvidia doesn\'t manufacture its own chips. It\'s a ""fabless"" chipmaker that outsources its production to third-party foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor\xa0and Samsung. However, these foundries can\'t manufacture their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips without Dutch semiconductor equipment ASML (NASDAQ: ASML).', ""ASML is the world's leading producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the world's only producer of top-tier extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to manufacture the world's smallest chips down to the 2nm node. Its newest high-NA EUV systems will enable foundries to produce chips that are smaller than 2nm over the next few years."", 'ASML\'s monopolization of this crucial technology gives it incredible pricing power. The world\'s three most advanced foundries -- TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- are all rushing to install more EUV and high-NA EUV systems to stay in the ""process race"" to produce more advanced chips. From 2022 to 2025, analysts expect ASML\'s revenue to grow at a CAGR of 16% as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 24%.', ""ASML's stock has already rallied more than 700% over the past 10 years and it isn't cheap at 35 times forward earnings. Its sales to China are also being throttled by the tightening trade restrictions, while new manufacturing technologies such as Canon's nanoimprint systems could potentially pry some foundries away from ASML."", ""Investors should certainly keep an eye on those long-term challenges, but I believe ASML's scale and dominance of the lithography market will ensure that it grows for decades to come. It might experience more macro headwinds and cyclical challenges, but it remains one of the best ways to profit from the secular expansion of the semiconductor market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Discovery's debt load."", ""With Warner's total debt already approaching $45 billion, it's understandable why investors aren't exactly enamored with the idea of a merger with Paramount. Should a deal be announced, we could see some revisions to Wall Street's price targets."", 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ranked as the hottest Nasdaq-100 stock last year. Shares of the chipmaker more than tripled on surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).', ""Wall Street doesn't expect Nvidia to keep up that torrid pace in 2024. But analysts nonetheless anticipate another great performance. The consensus 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of 33%."", ""The boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) shows no signs of ending anytime soon. That should translate into sustained demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which are widely viewed as the gold standard for powering AI apps."", ""There's one potential fly in the ointment, though. Rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers such as Alphabet's Google Cloud are rolling out their own powerful AI chips. Nvidia's almost total dominance of the market might come to an end in the not-too-distant future."", ""Not every Nasdaq-100 stock was a solid winner in 2023. PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares sank nearly 14% last year after plunging 62% in 2022."", ""The fintech pioneer could have a light at the end of the tunnel, though, if Wall Street is right. The average analysts' 12-month price target for PayPal is more than 29% above the current share price."", ""Despite the dismal stock performance in recent years, PayPal's underlying business appears to be in pretty good shape. The company's net revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings per share soared 20%. Total payment volume jumped 15%."", ""There's still uncertainty for PayPal, though. The company has a new leadership team. Competition in the digital payments market is intensifying.

You can skip our detailed analysis and data on workplace injuries and go directly to the best workplace injury lawyers and law firms in each of the 10 biggest cities in America.', 'Humans as vulnerable entities are prone to accidents and illnesses. Forbes Advisor defines workplace injury as any injury, illness or condition experienced in the employment of a company or in the deliverance of work-related duties and responsibilities. Lamentably, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a worker expiring every 96 minutes in 2022 due to occupational hazard. Workplace injury is thus an inevitable part of the job world. According to ILO statistics, there are 340 million occupational accidents and more than 160 million work related illnesses per year in the world.\xa0', 'While this stands true, it is also paramount to work arduously for ensuring human well-being in all forms at the workplace. The Occupational Safety and Health Act enacted in 1970 aimed precisely for these objectives. According to the act, the employer is bound by law to provide their workers with a secure and harmless work environment. The Public Health Post applauded the reduction in the death rate from 1913 because of OSHA, which has now become 5% of what it was in 1913.\xa0', 'Despite concerted efforts by both government and employers, workplace-related injuries have existed and in fact continue to spiral upwards. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2.8 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses by the private sector have been recorded in the year 2022-a 7.5% increase from 2021. Within this figure, illnesses have shown a fairly higher increase (26.1%) as compared to injuries (4.5%). The Bureau also published an alarming figure of 5,486 fatal work injuries in 2022- a 5.7% increase from the preceding year. To meet the demand, roughly 150,000 lawyers are part of the workplace injury legal industry.', 'National Safety Council has identified four most common workplace injuries that lead to days away from work: exposure to harmful substances, overexertion or overuse injuries, slips and falls and equipment related accidents. The upward movement of harmful substances from sixth place to first has mainly been attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The first three combine to form more than 75% of all nonfatal injuries and illnesses that result in days away from work. In addition, the council has also recognized four industrial sectors that can be concluded as most dangerous, depending on the measure employed: the construction industry for the most workplace deaths, education and health services for most nonfatal injuries and illnesses requiring days away from work, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting for highest death rate per 100,000 workers and transportation and warehousing for highest injury and illness rate involving days away from work per 10,000 workers.\xa0', 'According to Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Traumatic Occupational Injuries, data for 2022 showed that workers less than 25 years of age were treated more often in the emergency room for occupational injuries as compared to other age groups. Furthermore, men accounted for 66% of work related injuries treated in emergency and continue to show greater gender disparity overall in injury and death statistics. Statista places the age group 55-64 in the largest pile registering workplace death in 2021.\xa0', 'Given the high incidence of work related injuries, it is, therefore, not surprising that companies pay heavy amounts for compensation. Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index 2022 of top 10 reasons for workplace injury estimated its cost at higher than $1 billion a week and more than $58 billion a year to US businesses. The majority cost share seems to be coming from overexertion involving outside sources (handling objects) - $12.63 billion per year, followed closely by falls on the same level- $10.26 billion per year.\xa0', 'This in turn has given birth to various forms of industries including an occupational health and workplace safety services industry, which works to provide advice and assistance to companies for better management of employee work conditions- with OSHA compliance and evaluation service making up the largest chunk of key products in the market. According to an IBIS World report, the industry revenue is estimated at $11.1 billion in 2023 in spite of a 5% CAGR decline over the past five years. Amid rising need for tackling heavy costs associated with injuries and illnesses, other complementary industries like worker’s compensation and insurance companies have also risen to accommodate businesses as well as individuals. This industry was estimated to produce a $55 billion revenue in 2023, despite a 2.9% CAGR decline over the last five years. COVID-19, falling interest rates as well as an overcrowded insurance market seems to be the major reasons. In addition, personal injury lawyers and attorneys also play a crucial role in revenue generation for this industry. Notwithstanding the pandemic, this industry (with the exception of few certain types of cases like automobile accidents) fared well, contributing a $58.6 billion revenue by 2023.\xa0\xa0', 'Certain companies like AMERISAFE Inc.

OHS has however, reported North Dakota as the top state in 2021 for severe injury cases with 135 work related injuries for every 100,000 full time workers. The nature of available jobs in the state (transportation and material moving) as well as a 30 times greater than national average of oil well pumpers in the area, has been accounted as the major reason for this trend.\xa0', ""With that out of the way, let's head over to the list of best lawyers and law firms in each of the 30 biggest cities in the US."", ""A close-up of a person signing a loan agreement, emphasising safety and legality of this company's fixed & floating rate loan services."", 'For the article “Best Workplace Injury Lawyers in Each of 30 Biggest Cities in the US” we started off by shortlisting 30 largest US cities by population.

But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Walt Disney's  ROE today."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walt Disney is:', '3.0% = US$3.4b ÷ US$113b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.03 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""It is quite clear that Walt Disney's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 14%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 35% seen by Walt Disney over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio."", ""However, when we compared Walt Disney's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 18% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is DIS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Walt Disney's performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

This new product will enhance PGIM’s offerings and help it cater to the evolving needs of investors. These ETFs will be sub-advised by PGIM Quantitative Solutions.', 'The launch of these 2 ETF series bodes well for PRU as it will contribute to its asset management fees in the future. A higher level of assets under management and administration translates to a higher asset management fee income in the coming days. We expect assets under management and administration to grow 2.2% year over year in 2023. Per PGIM Quantitative Solutions 2024 outlook, a recession is not in sight, although downside risks prevail. The uneven economic conditions across the globe, going into 2024, should lead to improved demand for products offering downside protection.', 'PGIM’s investment strategies have been bearing positive results as 80% or more of its AUMs outperformed their respective benchmarks in the past five and 10-year periods. However, 83% of PGIM’s assets exceeded their benchmarks in the one-year period. Growing insurance and retirement businesses will also provide an impetus to PGIM through access to insurance liabilities and affiliated net flows.', 'PGIM’s buffer ETFs will provide exposure to an ETF tracking the S&P 500 Index and have embedded 12% and 20% buffer options. In this new ETF, the upside will be limited to a predetermined level, and the downside will have buffer options till the first 12% or 20% of the fund’s losses over one year. Offering a narrow range of results makes this investment vehicle attractive for investors seeking less volatile results. With this new launch, PGIM’s total active ETFs have doubled to 16 from last year.', 'Prudential currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).', 'Shares of Prudential have gained 14.7% in the past three months compared with the\xa0industry’s growth of 12.3%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Investors interested in the broader\xa0Finance\xa0space can consider some better-ranked companies like\xa0Blue Owl Capital Corporation\xa0OBDC,\xa0Axos Financial, Inc.

All of them offer material yields, but each serves a different purpose in a diversified portfolio. Here's a quick rundown on what you need to know to get started."", 'The energy sector is broken into four broad areas: upstream (energy production), downstream (chemicals and refining), equipment & service contractors, and midstream (pipelines). The first three can be highly volatile, while the fourth, midstream, is boring.', ""That's where Canada's Enbridge sits, with a massive collection of energy infrastructure assets spread across North America. It charges fees for the use of its assets, or they are regulated or contract-based (it owns a natural gas utility and has some clean energy exposure)."", ""The boring nature of the company's business is highlighted by its 28 consecutive annual dividend increases. The dividend yield today is a very attractive 7.4%, which will entice investors looking to maximize current income. The trade-off is that the yield is likely to make up the lion's share of total return, with only slow business growth likely in the future."", ""Indeed, the company's recent agreement to buy three regulated natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) cements the slow growth view. Distributable cash flow growth is expected to be around 3% through 2025 and 5% thereafter, neither of which will light anyone's world on fire. However, slow and steady (and high yield) could be just what some investors are looking for."", ""ExxonMobil's claim to fame on the dividend front is its 41-year history of annual dividend increases. That's so incredible because oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities prone to swift, and often dramatic, price swings."", ""For more than four decades, Exxon has survived them all in relative stride. The current dividend yield is around 3.8%, which isn't huge, but is more than twice what you'd get from an S&P 500 index fund."", ""There are two keys to Exxon's success. The first is its diversified business model, with assets spanning across three areas of the energy sector (upstream, midstream, and downstream). That helps to soften the blow when times are tough, though in fairness it can also limit upside when times are good. Most dividend investors will probably see that as a fair trade-off."", ""The second notable factor here is the company's balance sheet. Exxon's debt-to-equity ratio is a modest 0.2 times today. That gives it the leeway to take on debt to support its business and dividend during a period of low oil prices. When prices recover, as they have historically, leverage is reduced."", 'If you are looking for oil exposure and a reliable dividend, Exxon is one of your best options.', ""Devon Energy is an acquired taste that won't be right for most investors. The reason for this is that the company's dividend is tied to performance, so it rises and falls over time. And the company operates exclusively in the upstream space, which is the most impacted by energy price swings."", ""To put some numbers on this, the dividend was $1.55 per share in the third quarter of 2022, but fell to $0.49 per share in the third quarter of 2023. The dividend yield today is 6.3%, but that's not a figure you can really count on, given the variable dividend policy in place today."", ""If you need consistent income, you don't want to own Devon. But if you are a bit more aggressive and active, it could provide a hedge against real-world energy prices. Essentially, just when you are likely to be paying more for gasoline and heating fuel, Devon's dividend is likely to be increasing."", 'Of course, the dividend will also be falling as your energy costs decline as well. While not for every investor, some might find the variable dividend policy a good fit for an otherwise diversified income portfolio.', ""There is no right way to invest -- it all depends on the type of investor you are. If you like big yields from boring companies, Enbridge is worth a deep dive in January. If you are looking for oil and natural gas exposure but don't want to sacrifice a reliable income stream, Exxon is a great choice. And if you want a way to hedge your real-world energy costs and don't mind a little dividend volatility, Devon could be just what you want."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?', 'Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ExxonMobil wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

However, a possible policy pivot could change everything. We’re already seeing evidence of the anticipated shift now.', 'While the equities market has been resilient amid the tough backdrop, it bounced dramatically higher over the past several weeks. The reason? Recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at possible interest rate cuts next year. If that actually materializes – and to be clear, that’s still a big “if” – then the subsequent decline in borrowing costs should lift risk-on sentiment. And that would bode well for growth stocks to buy now.', 'In the spirit of full disclosure, investors should realize that this frameworks presents significant risks. With the labor market still running hot, it doesn’t seem appropriate to reduce borrowing costs. At the same time, major institutions continue to implement layoffs. That suggests the economy might not be doing so well as previously hoped.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'In that case, rate cuts might make sense. Assuming this scenario, below are growth stocks to buy now.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'An energy company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration (upstream), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) may be a key beneficiary among growth stocks to buy now. Since the start of the year, DVN almost immediately began slipping in the charts. Due to various headwinds, including economic pressures resulting in broader demand loss along with geopolitical dynamics that failed to spark upside, the energy specialist struggled.', 'However, a change in monetary policy could be exactly what the company needs to get back on track. At a cynical level, lower interest rates imply a relatively devalued dollar. That should boost the price of commodities, including critical energy sources like petroleum. Further, those who did suffer from the aforementioned layoffs may be scrambling to find a new job.', 'In this situation, a new employer may be reluctant to allow remote-work benefits for people it hasn’t met in person. Collectively, this framework could help boost hydrocarbon demand, in turn lifting upstream energy providers. Analysts are bullish on Devon, rating its shares a moderate buy with a $56.28 average price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A precious metals company, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) makes plenty of sense as one of the prospects for growth stocks to buy now. Again, if the Fed lowers the benchmark interest rate, that would imply the dollar would be devalued against other currencies. It would also translate to gold being more valuable compared to the greenback, all other things being equal.', 'Even better, Franco-Nevada is structured as a gold royalty and streaming company. That means the company isn’t directly tied to the vagaries and volatility of metal extraction. Rather, Franco-Nevada provides an upfront payment to mining specialists. In exchange, FNV receives a pre-determined share of the revenue (royalty) or the metal production (streaming).', 'Fundamentally, the underlying predictability of the royalty and streaming business model should help assuage investors’ concerns about gold. And it goes without saying that wagering on an entity like FNV is a lot more convenient than buying, storing and securing physical gold.', 'Unsurprisingly, analysts are optimistic about Franco-Nevada, pegging its shares as a moderate buy. Also, the average price target comes out to $149.77.', 'Source: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com', 'To get it out of the way, Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. I get that. However, even if you’re against the underlying industry for ethical, safety and/or political concerns, there’s also no getting around a core reality: Americans love their guns. As several media outlets have pointed out, in the U.S., we have more guns than we do people. It is what it is.', 'Given this reality, Sturm Ruger – if we’re approaching the matter objectively – enjoys a large addressable market. And what makes RGR a compelling (albeit incredibly controversial) idea among growth stocks to buy now is that the addressable market got bigger. That’s right. N95 respirators weren’t the only products flying off the shelves during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis.', 'Indeed, you might say there was another epidemic; an epidemic of fear that translated into the purchase of firearms at tremendous scale. Now, many households now have so many guns that they haven’t fired.', 'Lower borrowing costs should boost consumer sentiment, which may translate to increased recreational activities. At least one analyst seems to recognize the upside opportunity.', 'Source: Boyloso / Shutterstock', 'A workforce lodging specialist, Target Hospitality (NASDAQ:TH) provides lodging services and other temporary, modular housing solutions for oil, gas and mining operations. As well, Target serves large-scale events, government agencies and disaster relief. Frankly, it’s one of the riskiest ideas to consider, having lost a tremendous amount of value in the past year. At the same time, a dovish monetary policy pivot could change things.', 'Fundamentally, the hydrocarbon sector – Target’s bread and butter – may be poised to rise. Yes, lower interest rates would likely devalue the dollar, sending critical commodity prices northward. That’s a solid reason in and of itself to consider TH as one of the growth stocks to buy now. However, other factors, such as oil-producing nations agreeing to voluntary production cuts should tip the scale favorably for Target.', 'Logically, more demand for hydrocarbons would spell more demand for workers. If so, somebody would have to house them as many projects are located out in the boonies. Sure enough, analysts agree, pegging TH a unanimous strong buy with a $14 price target.', 'Source: imageAllan / Shutterstock.com', 'Specializing in the design and manufacturing of advanced cameras and projection systems, Imax (NYSE:IMAX) ranks among the more intriguing ideas for growth stocks to buy now. Yes, it’s a risky idea, no doubt about it. Over the past few weeks, IMAX gave up a conspicuous amount of equity value. Still, the red ink could spell a de-risked opportunity.', 'On a broader level, lower borrowing costs historically led to increased consumer sentiment. To be sure, throughout the holidays, the evidence points to modern consumers being favorably responsive to lower rates. That’s because consumers didn’t stop shopping; instead, the way they exercised their discretionary desires – through buy now, pay later (BNPL) platforms – changed.', 'Stated differently, people continued to open their wallets despite economic difficulties. Therefore, if the Fed reduces borrowing costs, this dynamic will allow that spending to materialize more effectively. In turn, consumers may be willing to fork over for premium experiences like watching Imax-projected films.', 'Analysts appear enthusiastic about the idea, rating shares a consensus strong buy with a $23.50 price target.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'A risky endeavor, I hesitate to call Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) one of the growth stocks to buy now. Having dropped almost 22% of equity value since the beginning of the year, JAZZ presents high risks. Not only that, the broader fundamentals pose viability concerns. After all, in October, Bloomberg reported that the company was exploring strategic options including a potential sale.', 'A month later, Jazz reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.84 in the third quarter. This result missed analysts’ consensus target of $4.90. As well, the figure declined 6% year-over-year due to increased research and development expenditures during Q3. Adding to the woes, sales of the sleep disorder drug Xyrem collapsed 51% YOY.', 'Nevertheless, Jazz is making good progress in other therapeutics, including its epilepsy drug Epidiolex and its cannabis-based mouth spray for multiple sclerosis-related spasticities called Sativex. Moving forward, if the Fed lowers interest rates, it may help Jazz finance future initiatives. And for what it’s worth, analysts peg shares a strong buy with a $193.36 price target, implying 58% upside.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Last but not least, we have Contango Ore (NYSEAMERICAN:CTGO) as one of the growth stocks to buy now. Granted, it’s a high-risk, high-reward enterprise so you don’t want to treat this play flippantly. Also, the company only carries a market capitalization of $179 million. By arguably most standards, that’s well within micro-cap territory. Huge upswings are possible but so are collapses.', 'With that out of the way, the mineral exploration and development company is intriguing because of its gold projects in Alaska. It’s not currently producing gold. Instead, it owns a 30% interest in the Peak Gold Joint Venture with Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC). However, production should start next year, which should pique speculators’ curiosity.', 'If borrowing costs decline, that implies dollar devaluation. And few assets respond as heartily to such devaluation as gold. And given that CTGO is a choppy micro-cap trade, Fed Chair Powell could make investors very happy. And that’s what Maxim Group’s Tate Sullivan anticipates, with a $36 price target implying 89% growth.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Stock market investing can also be highly rewarding if it involves proper research and strategy and is aligned with long-term trends. And then there are the no-brainer situations where it becomes obvious that a stock is a great addition to an investment portfolio.', ""When it comes to those no-brainer options, investors might want to consider establishing small stakes in stocks such as Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Here's why these three stocks can prove to be impressive no-brainer picks in the coming years."", 'Data analytics specialist Palantir gained a reputation for its impressive ability to uncover insights from complex data sets, which can then aid clients in informed decision-making. The company started its growth journey with the Gotham platform which primarily serves government clients. More recently, it has expanded into the commercial sector with its Foundry platform.', ""A bearish report from William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in early December 2023 does question the lower value and tenure of Palantir's renewed contract with the U.S. Army. But Palantir's government business is still quite sticky and strong. In the current era of geopolitical turmoil, Palantir's data intelligence and analytics platforms are being increasingly used by military and intelligence agencies worldwide. The company recently launched Palantir Government Web Services (GWS), which provides software to defense industrial companies to operationalize and scale their mission-critical capabilities rapidly."", ""Palantir's commercial business is also growing at a healthy clip and reached the $1 billion annualized run rate at the end of the third quarter. The company has been rapidly expanding its commercial customer base and securing large deals. That expansion is evident from its third quarter 12% year-over-year jump in the U.S. commercial customer count and the 55% year-over-year rise in U.S. commercial total contract value (TCV). Palantir is also seeing robust growth in international commercial business, especially in Asia and the Middle East."", ""Finally, the recently launched Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP, a platform that allows clients to use large language models on their proprietary data) is also seeing solid adoption trends. At the end of the third quarter, 300 distinct organizations had already started using AIP. AIP is also helping drive Palantir's U.S. commercial business, resulting in further expansion of contracts with existing clients."", 'Considering these tailwinds, Palantir stock seems well-positioned to surge in 2024.', 'Leading memory and storage player Micron Technology offers a range of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory chips for various applications in areas such as automotive, enterprise, cloud server, industrial, and graphics.', 'The cyclical stock suffered in early 2023 over concerns about the economy and a slowdown in PC sales which led to an oversupply of memory chips in the market. The company expects a healthy supply-demand environment to drive its recovery in 2024. Memory chip inventory is now at or near normal levels in several end markets, such as mobile, auto, industrial, and PC.', ""Micron is also well positioned to leverage the multiyear opportunity created by the rapid adoption of generative AI worldwide. Data centers being asked to handle AI workloads are showing an increased preference for Micron's high-memory bandwidth technology, HBM3E, the latest DRAM generation D5, and other high-capacity server memory modules. These trends should lead to higher pricing for Micron's memory technologies in 2024 and a boost in Micron's margins."", ""Micron's recent financial performance has also significantly improved from the previous quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Nov. 30, 2023), the company's revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share (EPS) all surpassed company guidance."", 'Micro did report an operating loss of $955 million in the first quarter, but it is projecting a gradual shift toward profitability with reduced operating loss in the second quarter and a return to operating profit by the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Micron also guided for a dramatic increase in its target addressable market in 2025. All these tailwinds make Micron a compelling buy now.', 'Chip manufacturing giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also known as TSMC, is also expecting demand stabilization in PC and smartphone end markets it serves. Company management said the chip inventory levels with fabless semiconductor players have leveled off and it should see healthy growth in 2024.', 'Being the largest third-party semiconductor manufacturer in the world, with a 58% market share, TSMC stands to benefit from the ongoing supply-demand mismatch in AI chips. The company also stands to be a beneficiary of the rising chip demand in rapidly growing end markets, such as cloud computing, autonomous driving, the Internet of Things, and edge computing.', ""TSMC is already witnessing a solid demand for its 3-nanometer process technology (N3, the most advanced semiconductor technology) from high-performance computing (HPC) and smartphone applications. The company's N3 process technology is expected to be a multiyear growth catalyst. TSMC is also gearing up for volume production of 2nm process technology in 2025 to meet increased demand for energy-efficient computing in AI applications."", ""It is no secret that TSMC has been grappling with geopolitical tensions stemming from China's stance on Taiwan's sovereignty. Despite these risks, and considering the company's technology leadership in the AI space, broad customer base, recovering end markets, and focus on cost-efficiencies and optimal utilization of manufacturing facilities, TSMC's stock can grow significantly in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

MLM is benefiting from strong pricing gains in aggregates, strength in public construction and accretive acquisitions. Also, emphasis on long-term strategic plans — markedly SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives bodes well.The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% brings optimism to the housing market and the related industry. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hints at potential rate cuts by the end of 2024. This stability provides relief for companies like Martin Marietta, anticipating a reversal in the current single-family housing slowdown. Home prices and borrowing rates are expected to find equilibrium, addressing the demand-supply gap resulting from significant underbuilding over the last decade and homeowners' reluctance to abandon low-rate mortgages.Shares of this leading supplier of construction aggregates in the United States have gained 41.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry’s 37.3% growth."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s 2024 earnings and sales are likely to witness growth of 14% and 9.6% year over year, respectively. Earnings estimates for 2024 have increased 1.3% upward over the past 60 days. This positive trend signifies bullish analysts’ sentiments, indicating robust fundamentals and the expectation of outperformance in the near term.Let’s discuss the major driving factors.Strong Aggregates Pricing: Martin Marietta is poised to benefit from pricing improvements and growth initiatives. The Aggregates business anticipates increased sales and profits in the forthcoming quarters, supported by strong underlying demand.Despite a 7.3% year-over-year decline in aggregate shipments during the third quarter of 2023, a 20% increase in pricing and a focus on a value-over-volume commercial strategy led to significant growth. In the quarter, Aggregates’ revenues rose 8% to $1.22 billion and gross profit grew 32.1% to a record value of $440.6 million year over year. The company remains optimistic about the aggregates-intensive, heavy, non-residential sector. Moreover, the single-family start demand improvements raise hope for the future. For 2023, Martin Marietta now expects total Aggregates pricing per ton to grow 18-20%, up from the previously anticipated range of 17-19%.In 2024, the company foresees stable aggregate shipments. Increased infrastructure investment and significant activity in large-scale non-residential projects are expected to counterbalance potential weakness in interest rate-sensitive private construction markets.Robust Public Infrastructure Demand: The U.S. government's infrastructure push benefits aggregate producers like Martin Marietta, with increased demand expected. Although single-family housing faces affordability challenges, public projects and strength in energy and manufacturing provide balance for the company.As of Sep 30, 2023, highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards increased 18.2% to a record of $114 billion compared with $97 billion as of September 2022's end. In the third quarter of 2023, the infrastructure market accounted for 39% of aggregate shipments.The new Federal Infrastructure Law and strong state Department of Transportation (DOT) budgets in the company’s key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California provide Martin Marietta with a long-awaited runway for multi-year growth in infrastructure demand. Martin Marietta believes that its strategic coast-to-coast footprint is well-positioned for long-term growth, backed by favorable population migration trends, housing shortages in markets and a long-term federal highway bill complemented by healthy DOT budgets in its key states.Long-Term Strategic Plans to Drive Growth: The company achieved its most profitable year in 2021, driven by its long-term strategic plans, SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives. The company's 11th consecutive year of growth in 2022 included consolidated revenues, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA. MLM's strategic focus involves portfolio optimization, expanding core businesses, investing in high-growth markets and pursuing opportunities within existing markets.Focus on Acquisitions and Divestitures: The company is reviewing its overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value by monetizing or exchanging select assets. On Nov 21, 2023, MLM entered into a definitive agreement to divest its South Texas cement business and certain of its related concrete operations to CRH plc’s subsidiary, CRH Americas Materials, Inc.After terminating the agreement with CalPortland for the sale of the Tehachapi California cement plant on May 3, 2023, Martin Marietta finally divested this business to UNACEM Corp. SAA. on Oct 31, 2023. The transaction was completed for $315 million. Also, it divested its California-based Stockton cement import terminal on May 3.Although the company did not acquire any businesses in the past year or the first nine months of 2023, it has ample flexibility to continue investing in the business and pursuing accretive acquisition opportunities in the future."", 'Some other top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are:Fluor Corporation FLR sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Companies like ExxonMobil XOM, Chevron CVX, Occidental Petroleum OXY, Harbour Energy plc HBRIY, Eni S.p.A. E and Woodside were at the forefront, making multi-billion-dollar deals that showed not only their strategic plans but also how well the industry can adapt to global changes. That's exactly what happened in 2023, and it's something that you, as an investor, need to understand."", 'ExxonMobil, a giant player in the energy sector, led the way with a groundbreaking move to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for a whopping $59.5 billion. This deal allows ExxonMobil to grow in the United States, especially in the Permian Basin, a region rich in shale oil in the southern United States. XOM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\xa0the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'The merger with Pioneer signifies a massive estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources in the Permian Basin. The combination of Pioneer’s 850,000 net acres in the Midland Basin and ExxonMobil’s 570,000 net acres in the Delaware and Midland basins makes a total enterprise value of around $64.5 billion, including debt.', ""ExxonMobil isn't just making big acquisitions, it’s also committed to being environmentally friendly. The company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from its Permian operations by 2030. It’s even accelerating Pioneer’s plan to be net zero by 2035. XOM is set to invest more than $20 billion in lower-emission opportunities by 2027, showing a strong commitment to environmental sustainability."", ""Chevron, another big U.S. oil company, is making smart moves with a $53-billion all-stock deal to acquire Hess Corporation. This move, set to finish in the first half of 2024, shows Chevron's dedication to diversifying and growing its portfolio. CVX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3."", ""After the acquisition, Chevron's annual budget for capital expenses is expected to be between $19 and $22 billion. Adding assets from Hess, especially in Guyana’s Stabroek block and more shale assets, makes Chevron’s portfolio even richer. This doesn’t just mean more oil and gas for Chevron, but also more options for investors. The Permian Basin remains a key focus, highlighting its importance in the industry."", 'Occidental joined the consolidation trend by acquiring CrownRock in December 2023, a deal worth about $12 billion. This strategic move strengthens OXY’s Permian portfolio, adding around 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-margin, lower-decline unconventional production in 2024.', ""According to Wood Mackenzie's Robert Clarke, OXY's move, along with other big deals in 2023, solidifies the Permian scale as a 'must-have' for U.S. majors and super-independents. Completing the CrownRock merger will establish OXY as a top-three producer in the Permian, reinforcing its importance in the industry."", ""Harbour Energy joined the consolidation story with an $11.2-billion deal to acquire Wintershall Dea's entire non-Russian oil and gas portfolio, including carbon capture and storage assets in Europe. This move makes Harbour Energy one of the world’s biggest independent oil and gas companies, with operations in Norway, Argentina, Germany, Mexico, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and Denmark."", ""The acquisition boosts HBRIY's production to more than 500 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day and aligns with its goals for energy transition. \xa0The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Harbour Energy isn’t just interested in oil, it’s also into natural gas and carbon dioxide capturing. This makes the company a responsible choice for environmentally conscious investors."", ""In Australia, there's talk of a potential $79.09 billion merger between Woodside Energy and Santos. This consolidation could unlock growth opportunities and create a strong force in the Australian gas market."", 'Apart from focusing on shale oil, U.S. companies are also moving into liquefied natural gas (LNG), presenting a $100 billion opportunity. Despite challenges, Sean Harrison, Research Analyst, Gas & LNG believes that U.S. LNG projects secured more than $40 billion in financing in 2023, showing continued interest from investors and major industry players.', 'Highlighting the global nature of recent deals, European oil major Eni acquired Neptune Energy’s entire portfolio (excluding operations in Germany and Norway) in a deal valued at $4.9 billion with Vår Energi AS, a Norwegian oil and gas company. The transactions are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2024. This deal shows that gas is still a hot commodity, even in a world moving toward renewables. E currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.', ""This means that the oil and gas industry is far from dead. Companies are getting bigger, smarter and greener. They're adapting to changing markets and embracing new technologies, which means there are still plenty of opportunities for investors who know where to look."", '2023 was undoubtedly a transformative year for the oil and gas industry, marked by big deals and smart moves. The Permian Basin stood out as a central stage for consolidation, with U.S. majors and global players reshaping their portfolios to align with sustainable practices and evolving market demands. As the industry faces challenges and embraces change, these acquisitions set the tone for a future where resilience and adaptability will be the keys to success.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Boston Scientific and Medtronic may have a duopoly over that time, with the Truist analysts forecasting additional competitors will come to market in 2026 or later.\xa0', 'The impact of an early approval on Boston Scientific will depend on its supply chain. In an October earnings call, Boston Scientific CEO Michael Mahoney told investors the team “has done a terrific job over the past 18 months in building supply of both catheters and the capital equipment needed,” adding that the company had “really significantly improved [its] supply capabilities” and would “be ready for the U.S. launch.”', 'At that time, Boston Scientific expected to launch in the U.S. in the second half of 2024.

Basically, the sector benefits from an unavoidable reality. Wherever there are people, there will be trash. Further, as the number of people rises – due to natural births and immigration – someone must deal with the rubbish created.', 'And that of course is where waste management stocks come in. No, it’s not a sexy industry – far from it. More than likely, most of us would rather have zero hands-on experience with this sector. Nevertheless, it’s a dirty job that requires addressing. Otherwise, the economy could quite literally crumble to a halt.', 'According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) tipped the scales at 292.4 million tons in 2018. That translates to 4.9 pounds per person, per day. Unsurprisingly, the North American waste management market size reached a valuation of $208 billion in 2019. And by 2027, this industry could be worth almost $230 billion.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'It may be slow growth but it’s dependable growth. And on that note, below are top waste management stocks to consider.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'An obvious idea among waste management stocks to consider is Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which offers comprehensive sector-related services in North America. Per its public profile, WM’s network includes 346 transfer stations, 293 active landfill disposal sites, and 146 recycling plants, among many other facilities. Since the start of the year, shares popped up 13%. In the trailing month, they gained almost 5%.', 'Primarily, WM’s core strengths lie in its operational resilience and consistent profitability. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.5%, above the sector median of 7.6%. Its gross, operating, and net margins land at the top 70th percentile or greater. And it posted 10 years of net income over the past decade.', 'If there was an area to nitpick, it’s that WM isn’t exactly cheap. Because of its predictability, WM trades at a forward earnings multiple of 26.12X. That’s higher than nearly 74% of its peers. Still, analysts rate shares a moderate buy and the company offers a forward dividend yield of 1.58%.', 'Source: Michael T Hartman / Shutterstock.com', 'Another example of top waste management stocks, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) provides an excellent alternative to Waste Management. A waste disposal specialist, Republic offers various solutions, including non-hazardous solid waste collection, waste transfer and disposal, and recycling and energy services. Per its public profile, it’s the second-largest provider in the industry behind WM.', 'While RSG might be the little sibling, there’s no question which one’s performing better at the moment. Since the beginning of the year, Republic shares jumped more than 27%. Part of the reason for the enhanced enthusiasm is the company’s earnings performances. Consistently, Republic tops estimates for earnings per share. And it usually beats on revenue too.', 'In contrast, WM has been hit or miss in the past few quarters, which may raise some eyebrows. Where the two meet is in the general financial profile. Like WM, Republic enjoys decent sales growth and consistent profitability. However, investors pay a premium to forward earnings of 28X.', 'Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $169.64 average price target.', 'Source: Jordi_Cor / Shutterstock.com', 'Billed as an industry leader in waste management services throughout the U.S. and Canada, Waste Connections (NYSE:WCN) provides a full range of solutions.

As well, it manages special waste disposals.', 'Like many other waste management stocks, WCN printed a choppy price action this year. However, toward the end of 2023, it happens to be up over 12% since the January opener. Notably, in the trailing month, shares spiked up more than 11%. Financially, WCN benefits from the consistency and predictability inherent within the industry.', 'However, some of its metrics are noticeably superior to its peers. For example, WCN’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.1%, beating out nearly 62% of its peers. Also, since the fourth quarter of 2022, WCN beat expectations for both EPS and revenue.', 'Finally, analysts rate shares a strong buy, with the high-side target coming in at $175.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

In that way, stock splits tend to point investors toward businesses with solid fundamentals. It's the price appreciation, not the stock split, that is the important signal."", 'Keeping that in mind, Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) returned 229% over the last five years, more than doubling the return of the S&P 500. That price appreciation can be ascribed to a series of strong financial performances arising from its leadership in U.S. tax preparation and accounting software. Intuit is well positioned to maintain that momentum thanks to efforts to infuse its products with artificial intelligence.', ""Intuit is undoubtedly a stock split candidate in 2024, but patient investors should consider buying the stock whether that split happens or not. Here's why."", 'Intuit breaks its business into three primary segments. The consumer group includes TurboTax tax preparation software and services for consumers and small businesses. The small business and self-employed group comprises QuickBooks accounting software and a broad range of adjacent services, including solutions for marketing, payment processing, and payroll. Finally, Credit Karma is a financial platform that connects consumers with credit cards, loans, and insurance products.', 'Intuit reported strong financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31), beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 15% to $3 billion, driven by particularly strong growth in consumer group and the small business and self-employed group products. Additionally, non-GAAP net income soared 45% to $960 million.', 'For the full year, management expects revenue growth ranging from 11% to 12%, and non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth ranging from 12% to 14%. But investors can expect similar momentum in subsequent years, as Intuit believes it has tapped just 5% of its $300 billion addressable market.', 'Intuit is the gold standard in U.S. tax preparation and accounting software. TurboTax holds a 73% market share, and QuickBooks holds an 80% market share. Intuit has already improved its ability to attract and monetize users with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, which provide on-demand access to tax and bookkeeping professionals, but there is plenty of room to increase adoption.', 'Additionally, leadership in accounting software positions Intuit to cross-sell small businesses with adjacent solutions for marketing, payment processing, and payroll. The company also has an opportunity to bring 40 million Credit Karma users to TurboTax, and steer 90 million TurboTax users toward Credit Karma Money savings and checking accounts. Management believes artificial intelligence (AI) can draw new users and improve monetization by driving cross-platform adoption.', 'On that note, Intuit recently launched a generative AI assistant (Intuit Assist) that can surface recommendations and automate workflows to improve the user experience across TurboTax, Credit Karma, and QuickBooks. For instance, Intuit Assist can provide explanations and discover deductions that ultimately reduce tax preparation time for TurboTax users. Similarly, it can simplify the onboarding process, answer business questions, and create marketing campaigns for QuickBooks users.', 'Additionally, Intuit Assist can help consumers get refunds faster by creating Credit Karma Money accounts, and it can recommend adjacent products that help small businesses grow more efficiently. It can also steer users toward TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live in situations that call for professional advice. In that way, management believes Intuit Assist will improve user monetization across all three product groups.', 'With that in mind, Intuit expects long-term revenue growth of 10% annually in consumer group products, 17.5% annually in the small business and self-employed group products, and 22.5% annually in Credit Karma. That implies total revenue growth in the mid-teens over the next three to five years.', 'Intuit has a durable competitive advantage built on brand authority and switching costs. Namely, TurboTax and QuickBooks are the gold standards in their respective categories, and it would be time consuming and costly for users to switch products. That affords Intuit a certain degree of pricing power, a quality that Warren Buffett prizes in a business.', 'Going forward, Morningstar analysts expect Intuit to grow revenue at 13% annually over the next five years. That aligns with projections from management, and it makes the current valuation of 11.5 times sales appear reasonable. For context, that multiple is identical to the three-year average.', 'Based on its current price, I think Intuit could produce market-beating returns over the next five years, just as it did over the last five years. That is true whether or not the company splits its stock, though news of a stock split could certainly draw attention to Intuit and put upward pressure on its share price. In either case, investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuit right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuit, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intuit wasn't one of them.

The credits are universally available to qualifying corporations and not specific to Intuit.', '“The purpose of the federal research tax credits is to spur innovation and growth for the economy as a whole, not to subsidize the profits of already dominant companies,” the legislators wrote.', 'Intuit has argued that a government-run program is unnecessary because about a third of its TurboTax users already receive tax services for free. It has also said that the government would not have an incentive to help people find tax-breaks.', 'In September, a Federal Trade Commission judge ruled that Intuit misled consumers by claiming its TurboTax product was free when most customers needed to pay a fee for the software program.

The conglomerate owns several insurers, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, National Indemnity, and Alleghany, which it acquired a couple of years ago for $11.6 billion.', ""The nature of insurance appeals to CEO Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire.

The insurer has an excellent track record of success thanks to its commitment to underwriting profitable policies.', 'In 1965, Peter B. Lewis (son of co-founder Joseph Lewis) took over the company. At the time, it was commonplace that insurers would break even on their policies and that the actual returns would come from their investment portfolios. Lewis rejected this practice and prioritized earning an underwriting profit on its policies, even if it meant losing out on some customers.', 'In 1971, the company committed to achieving a combined ratio of 96, meaning it would earn $4 in profit for every $100 of premium earned. This goal has been a cornerstone of its success.', ""Progressive has maintained a prudent, disciplined approach to underwriting policies ever since. And while the company isn't very aggressive with its investment portfolio, it doesn't matter. Since 1993, the company has returned 16.4% annually to investors, well above the S&P 500's annualized return of 10%. Best of all, the insurer continues underwriting profitable policies."", 'Berkshire Hathaway and Progressive are quality stocks if you want market-beating potential with less volatility. Beta measures how much a stock moves relative to the overall market. A value under 1 means a stock is less volatile than the broader market.', ""Berkshire and Progressive have five-year betas of 0.86 and 0.42, making these stocks a solid choice if you're looking to lower the overall volatility of your portfolio.

Following the 2022 bear market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite soared by 24% and 43% in 2023, respectively.', ""Regardless of what's thrown investors' way in the new year -- whether that be a continued march to new highs for the major indexes or the most-anticipated recession in history -- amazing deals can still be found for opportunistic investors willing to seek them out."", 'What follows are 10 unsurpassed stocks that can make you richer in 2024.', 'The first superior stock with all the tools and intangibles needed to deliver for shareholders in the new year is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of world-leading internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.', ""Though 2023 brought concerns of an ad spending slowdown, Alphabet's insurmountable moat has insulated it from much of the tumult. In December, Google accounted for 91.61% of global internet search share. Furthermore, it's sustained at least a 90% share of worldwide monthly internet search dating back to March 2015. As long as this moat exists, Alphabet is going to generate copious amounts of cash flow that it can redirect into high-growth initiatives."", 'Speaking of high-growth initiatives, cloud infrastructure service Google Cloud has made the shift to recurring profitability, while YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet, has enjoyed a roughly 670% increase in daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) since 2021.', 'Alphabet stock remains historically inexpensive and is ripe for additional upside.', ""Another industry leader that can fatten investors' portfolios in 2024 is the largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). Utilities struggled mightily last year as Treasury bond yields soared. But with the Federal Reserve expected to kick off a rate-easing cycle in the new year, utility yields are back in focus."", ""What separates NextEra Energy from dozens of other publicly traded electric utilities is its green-energy approach. Nearly half (34 gigawatts [GW]) of the company's 70 GW of operating capacity derives from renewables, including 23 GW from wind and 6 GW from solar, which are high-water marks for both energy sources from any utility in the world. Focusing on renewables has lowered its electricity generation costs and powered annualized adjusted earnings growth of almost 10% since 2012."", ""Furthermore, utilities supply a basic need. Regardless of whether you own or rent, you'll likely need electricity to power your appliances and possibly HVAC system. This leads to predictable operating cash flow year in and year out."", 'Telecom company AT&T (NYSE: T) is another stock that can make opportunistic investors richer in 2024. Although legacy telecom stocks were rocked by an investigative report from The Wall Street Journal in July that alleged they could face hefty replacement and environmental/health-related costs tied to their use of lead-clad cables, these claims appear to be much ado about nothing.', ""What matters is that AT&T is successfully executing on an operating basis. Upgrading its network to support 5G download speeds is increasing wireless revenue, encouraging users to consume more data (data is what generates the juiciest margins for the company's wireless segment), and bolstering its aggregate number of broadband customers."", 'AT&T has also made remarkable progress with its balance sheet. Since March 2022, the company has spun off content arm WarnerMedia, which was merged with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery. This new entity took control of certain debt lots previously held by AT&T. Including organic pay-down, AT&T has reduced its net debt by more than $40 billion to $128.7 billion.', ""One of my 10 stock market predictions for 2024 is that we'll witness what's currently the second-longest yield-curve inversion on record come to an end. A combination of dovish Federal Reserve monetary policy, coupled with a normalization of the yield curve, is an ideal environment for mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY)."", 'The mortgage REIT operating model involves borrowing money at short-term rates and using this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities. If interest rates decline in the new year, and the yield curve normalizes, short-term borrowing costs will fall and companies like Annaly will enjoy a higher net interest margin.', 'Additionally, Annaly Capital Management almost exclusively purchases agency assets. Agency securities are backed by the federal government in the event of default. What this added protection does is give Annaly the liberty of utilizing leverage to support its whopping 13.4% dividend yield.', 'A fifth unsurpassed stock that has a history of making its shareholders richer is healthcare company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). Based on total returns, which includes dividends paid, UnitedHealth Group has made its shareholders money in 20 of the past 22 years.', ""Most people are familiar with UnitedHealth because of the company's health insurance segment. Even though the Affordable Care Act has sapped some of the premium pricing power for health insurers in the individual market, UnitedHealth is doing just fine with its employer-based plans and within the individual marketplace."", 'Subsidiary Optum is an even bigger growth driver for UnitedHealth. Optum provides prescription refilling services, care delivery, and software solutions for healthcare companies, among a bevy of other solutions. Not only is Optum growing faster than the health insurance segment, but it often generates a considerably juicier operating margin.', ""Winners can be found beyond the borders of the U.S. as well. Look for e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) to sweeten investors' portfolios in 2024."", 'The most obvious catalyst for Alibaba is the steady return to normalcy for China\'s economy. China\'s regulators abandoned the stringent and highly controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy in December 2022. Though it\'s taking a while for China\'s once-dominant economy to ramp up, there remains a lengthy runway for e-commerce expansion. Alibaba\'s online shopping sites, Taobao and Tmall, account for about 51% of China\'s e-commerce market, per the International Trade Administration.', 'On top of being an e-commerce leader, Alibaba is also the clear No. 1 in cloud infrastructure services in China. Through March 2023, Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the $7.7 billion spent on cloud infrastructure services in the first quarter. This burgeoning segment is still in its early stages of growth.', ""When backing out Alibaba's mammoth cash position, it's trading at an all-time low of 5 times forward-year earnings."", 'Leading fintech company\xa0PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is the seventh unrivaled stock that can make you richer in the new year. Though increased competition in digital payments and above-average inflation have weighed on shares, an incredibly cheap valuation could be the catalyst that sends the stock notably higher.', 'Among the many performance indicators for PayPal, none are more important than its user engagement statistics. Three years ago, the average active account was completing 40.9 transactions on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. As of the end of the third quarter (Sept. 30, 2023), active accounts were nearing 57 transactions completed over the TTM. Since PayPal is predominantly a fee-driven platform, increasing the aggregate number of transactions is the easiest way to grow its gross profit.', ""We're also witnessing purposeful belt-tightening and shareholder-friendly moves being made by new CEO Alex Chriss and the company's board. PayPal was targeting $1.3 billion in annual operating cost reductions in 2023, and it looks to be on track to purchase around $5 billion worth of its own stock. A forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11 doesn't do justice to a company capable of sustained double-digit sales growth."", ""Though growth stocks were seemingly the flavor of the month every month in 2023, don't overlook the power of time-tested value names in 2024. High-octane dividend stocks like Altria Group (NYSE: MO), which sports a yield of nearly 10%, can make you richer this year."", ""The biggest issue for tobacco stocks is that as consumers have become aware of the long-term dangers of tobacco use, fewer adults have taken up the habit. Thankfully for Altria, the company behind leading premium cigarette brand Marlboro, it holds exceptional pricing power with existing smokers. Even if cigarette shipments decline, Altria's ability to raise prices can move both its sales and earnings per share higher."", ""Altria Group is expanding into smokeless products as well. In June 2023, it closed a $2.75 billion deal to acquire electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings. What makes NJOY such a catch is that it's received a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products. Whereas NJOY's e-vapor products have a green light to stay on retail shelves, the vast majority of e-vapor products don't."", 'Not all top stocks have to be household names. One company with the necessary catalysts to make you richer in 2024 is little-known adtech stock PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM).', ""As I pointed out earlier, the advertising market endured a downturn following the 2022 bear market. The good news is this slump should melt away with 2024 being an election year. Advertising agency GroupM believes U.S. political cycle ad spending will reach $16 billion this year, which would be a 31% increase over spending during the 2020 election cycle. With ad dollars shifting to digital channels, it's companies like PubMatic, which help publishers sell their digital display space, that will benefit."", ""What's often overlooked with PubMatic is that the company chose to design and develop its cloud-based infrastructure instead of relying on a third-party platform. Though this was a costlier up-front decision, it'll allow the company to rapidly grow its operating margin as its revenue scales."", 'Sporting $171.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt, PubMatic is sitting pretty.', 'The final unsurpassed stock that can make you richer in 2024 is payment-processing specialist Visa (NYSE: V). Despite certain money-based metrics sounding a warning for the U.S. economy and stock market, Visa has competitive edges that should help it reach new all-time highs this year.', 'Visa is a dominant force in payment facilitation domestically, and it has a multidecade opportunity awaiting it in emerging markets. In 2021, it accounted for 52.6% of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption). Furthermore, it can organically or acquisitively move its payment infrastructure into the Middle East, Southeastern Asia, and Africa in the coming years and decades to sustain a double-digit growth rate.', ""Visa's success is also a function of its focus on payment processing. Visa has passed on becoming a lender, which means it doesn't have to deal with loan losses during recessions. Not having to set aside capital for credit delinquencies and loan losses during economic downturns is an undeniable competitive edge that helps its profit margin remain above 50%."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

There is no doubt that 2023 was surprisingly strong in terms of retail sales trends. Disinflation trends and lingering excess savings from the pandemic, along with now-positive real wages, are helpful. Some pundits assert that increased dependence on credit cards and a surprising jump in holiday buy now, pay later activity are warning signs. Also, total holiday spending came in on the weak side.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with SOFI.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'I am slightly bullish on Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG). I see shares trading modestly under their long-term average valuation, but the stock sports relative technical weakness this year.', 'Source: Mastercard SpendingPulse', ""According to Bank of America Global Research, Procter & Gamble is among the world's largest consumer products companies. The company operates under five segments: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby & Family Care."", 'Some of its well-known brands include Tide, Bounty, Gillette, Crest, Olay, Head & Shoulders, Gain, Always, Downy and Dawn. Procter & Gamble is considered a Consumer Staples stalwart and is seen as a harbinger of consumer trends given its global and diversified portfolio.', 'Sporting a $344 billion market cap, the Ohio-based household products company within the consumer staples sector trades at an above-market 22.3 forward non-GAAP price-earnings multiple and it pays a high 2.6% dividend yield. With earnings due out in January, shares trade with a modest 18% implied volatility percentage while short interest on the stock is very low at just 0.6% as of Dec. 27.', ""Back in October, Procter & Gamble reported a solid first-quarter earnings report. Non-GAAP earnings of $1.83 per share topped the Wall Street consensus of $1.72 while $21.9 billion of quarterly revenue, up 6% from year-ago levels, also topped estimates. Organic sales growth was healthy at 7%, though currency impacts were negative due to a strong U.S. dollar. But with a weaker greenback since the middle of the year, expect comps to be positively impacted by foreign exchange. For fiscal year 2024, the management team sees some headwinds from currency impacts, but also a $400 million benefit from commodity tailwinds. The company's gross margin expanded in the quarter due to some pricing power which is impressive given the largely disinflationary environment consumers have enjoyed throughout the year. Of course, lower commodity costs also mean a decline in costs."", ""The concern now shifts to how U.S. and international consumers will perform in 2024. Nielsen retail data show that the U.S. market may be slowing while ongoing weakness in China is a key concern. Of course, commodity prices have continued to retreat since the end of the third quarter, so that should help the margin story as we wrap up 2023. There are idiosyncratic risks, too earlier this month, Procter & Gabmle said it would incur up to a $2.5 billion charge related to its 2005 acquisition of Gillette. What's more, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.ANYSE:BRK.B) () reportedly divested a small stake in the company."", 'Key risks for a consumer giant like Procter & Gamble include slowing ticket sales due to weaker inflation trends and a consumer shift toward lower-margin private-label products. At the investor level, if aggressive flows come into stocks next year, that could leave defensive stocks lagging compared to more cyclical areas of the market. Compared to its peers, the company features among the highest valuations while its growth history and trajectory are somewhat slow. Profitability and free cash flow trends are robust, though, and earnings per share revisions have actually been generally positive in the last three months. Still, share price momentum has been lackluster throughout 2023.', 'On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings rising at a steady mid to high single-digit clip over the next few years. The current consensus forecast calls for operating earnings topping $7 per share by 2026 with sales growth in the 3% to 5% range. Dividends, meanwhile, are expected to increase over the coming quarters, while its free cash flow situation remains positive.', ""With a non-cyclical name like P&G, investors must pay up for its defensive nature think of it like purchasing insurance during downturns. The stock has a five-year average non-GAAP earnings multiple of 24.4, and it currently trades at 22.7 times next year's earnings per share. If we assume a 24 price-earnings ratio and $6.60 of next 12-month earnings, then shares should be near $158, making it slightly undervalued today. Along the way, investors can earn a decent yield, too."", 'Source: BofA Global Research', 'Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show a confirmed second-quarter 2024 earnings date of Tuesday, Jan. 22. An earnings conference call takes place immediately after the numbers hit the tape. You can listen live here. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.', ""With shares modestly undervalued amid mixed macro risks and opportunities, Procter &Gamble's chart is unimpressive. Notice in the graph below the stock is within a trading range between the low $140s and high $150s. Shares are just now bouncing off that key area of support. Take a look, though, at the relative strength index momentum oscillator at the bottom of the graph it has been printing a series of lower highs, indicating that momentum is weakening during the consolidation in price."", ""I think P&G can bounce toward the high end of the range, but I would really like to see a definitive breakout above $160, and even above the all-time high of $165 to establish a renewed uptrend. On the downside, should the $141 support level break, then look for a possible move toward the low $120. Shares attracted buyers there on a pair of occasions once in early 2021 and again at the market's low in October last year. For now, with the stock under a flattening 200-day moving average, there is no clear trend. Moreover, there is a high amount of volume by price up to $160, making rally attempts tough sledding for the bulls."", 'Overall, the chart is neutral and Procter & Gamble has been an underperformer in 2023 with a persistent trading range.', 'I am slightly bullish on Procter & Gamble. I like the valuation, its free cash flow and solid yield, but consumer question marks are apparent for 2024 while the technical situation is less than stellar.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Meanwhile, the same move in the price of copper would result in a $325 million shift in operating cash flow.', 'As such, the $0.30 move from the October low to the price now represents a $1.26 billion difference in EBITDA in 2024 to 2025.', ""Commodity prices don't move in isolation, particularly not one as economically sensitive as an industrial metal like copper. It's used in a wide variety of industrial goods, ranging from electricity networks through transportation (where it plays a vital role in the clean energy transition) to construction and industrial and consumer goods."", ""Copper's exposure to electrical networks means it is essential to the global electrification of everything, whereby new technologies such as smart factories, infrastructure, and cities; data centers; industrial automation; electric vehicle EV charging networks; and a host of internet-enabled technologies are receiving investment."", 'So when the market starts pricing in the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in 2024 (the 10-year Treasury yield fell from 4.3% at the start of December to 3.96% at present), then commodities like copper are likely to do well on hopes of a better growth environment in 2024.', 'All told the strength in Freeport-McMoRan reiterates how good the stock is as a play on economic growth with the underlying driver of secular demand from the electrification of everything and clean energy transition to support it.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Freeport-McMoRan right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Freeport-McMoRan, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Freeport-McMoRan wasn't one of them.

However, both Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) have been able to pull that off (and then some) in the past half decade. Naturally, that doesn't automatically make these biotech stocks worth buying. Past performance isn't a guarantee of future success."", ""Can Regeneron and Moderna deliver similar returns in the next five years? Let's dig in and find out."", 'REGN data by YCharts', 'Regeneron has delivered a CAGR of 19.2% over the past five years, good enough to turn an initial investment of $1,000 into just a little more than $2,400. The biotech giant accomplished this feat thanks to two key growth drivers: eczema treatment Dupixent, and Eylea, which treats wet age-related macular degeneration. Regeneron shares the rights of the former with Sanofi, while it comarkets the latter with Bayer.', ""Regeneron did run into some issues with Eylea. A competing therapy named Vabysmo, marketed by Roche, has been eating its lunch, and it is also nearing a patent cliff. Thankfully, Regeneron earned approval for a high-dose formulation of Eylea that helps both issues. The high-dose formulation will attract more patients since it requires fewer annual doses, and it won't run out of patent exclusivity soon."", ""Meanwhile, Dupixent is still performing exceptionally well. In the third quarter, Regeneron's revenue increased by 15% year over year to $3.36 billion. Dupixent worldwide sales of $3.1 billion soared by 33% year over year. Further, the medicine could earn major label expansions, including in treating COPD. This should meaningfully improve Dupixent's sales."", ""What's more, Regeneron boasts many other pipeline candidates. The company has about a dozen late-stage programs and is targeting promising areas. Regeneron has also partnered with Intellia Therapeutics to develop a gene-editing therapy. The biotech is casting a wide net. While it won't have a 100% success rate -- no drugmaker does -- Regeneron should earn several important approvals in the next five years that will help bolster its business."", ""But can the company again deliver a CAGR of 19.22% over this period? My view is that this seems unlikely, especially given Eylea's challenges. While the high-dose formulation will help things, Vabysmo, approved in early 2022, isn't going anywhere. Considering Eylea's importance to Regeneron's results in the past five years, it's doubtful whether the company can record similarly impressive returns moving forward."", ""But a CAGR of 19.22% is an incredibly high bar. Even if Regeneron doesn't match this performance, its shares are still worth buying."", 'Moderna had a successful IPO in December 2018; since then, the company has delivered superior returns, with an impressive CAGR of 48.9% or an ending amount of just over $7,300.', ""However, it hasn't been a smooth upward movement for Moderna's stock. The shares soared in the first couple of years of the pandemic thanks to its successful efforts to develop and market a vaccine for COVID-19. But now that the outbreak has largely subsided, sales are falling, and profitability is gone."", ""Moderna's revenue of $1.8 billion in the third quarter was down substantially from the $3.4 billion reported in the third quarter of 2022. The biotech's net earnings per share of $2.53 in last year's September quarter turned into a net loss per share of $9.53 this time around."", 'Fortunately, there is hope for Moderna. The company should earn approval for brand-new products. One of them is a vaccine for the respiratory syncytial virus, mRNA-1345, which Moderna could launch next year. The company is also developing a cytomegalovirus vaccine called mRNA-1647 that is currently undergoing a phase 3 study.', ""Research firm Evaluate Pharma thinks mRNA-1647 is one of the industry's top 10 most valuable R&D projects, with an estimated 2028 revenue of $1.5 billion. Moderna also kicked off a phase 3 study for its promising cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, this year. It boasts many more programs in phase 2 studies. The biotech expects to return to top-line growth by 2025."", ""However, there is almost no chance Moderna will turn in a CAGR of 48.94% in the next half decade. The company's pandemic-related work was a major reason it was able to achieve that, and unless something similarly unusual happens, returns of this kind are out the window for a company of this size. Still, for patient investors, Moderna can still deliver good performances from here on out, given its highly innovative capabilities.

Tirzepatide puts Lilly at the front of a revolution in how obesity, a condition affecting some 40% of U.S. adults, is treated.', 'But part of Lilly’s formidable valuation is due to the company’s leading position in treating another prevalent scourge: Alzheimer’s disease. The company, which for years tried unsuccessfully to develop a treatment, finally succeeded with a drug called donanemab. Phase 3 testing showed that it could modestly slow the mental and physical decline due to Alzheimer’s.', 'The results will make donanemab — if approved by the FDA this quarter as expected — a competitor to Eisai and Biogen’s rival Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi. Analysts view donanemab as a potentially superior treatment, but Lilly will face the same questions around cost and benefit as Eisai and Biogen have with Leqembi.', 'If donanemab wins over regulators, insurers and doctors, Lilly could be a leader in treating two of this century’s greatest health threats. — Ned Pagliarulo', 'Few diseases have confounded drugmakers over the last decade more than metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, a condition previously called NASH. Multiple large firms have seen promising prospects fail in testing. And the first drug developer to reach regulatory review — Intercept Pharmaceuticals — was rejected twice by the FDA and subsequently abandoned its efforts.', 'Madrigal Pharmaceuticals could succeed where others failed. Positive results from a Phase 3 study in 2022 have put the company on the precipice of bringing the first drug to market for MASH, a condition estimated to affect millions of people. Its drug resmetirom, which could be approved by March 14, is supported by data that industry watchers see as more convincing than Intercept’s.', 'Analysts at the investment bank Piper Sandler, for instance, called Madrigal’s filing the most “comprehensive clinical data package” in MASH to date. “We think this drives a compelling risk/benefit profile to the FDA,” they wrote in a report last month.', 'If approved, resmestirom’s launch will be closely watched. The commercial prospects of MASH drugs have long been debated, as the disease often goes undiagnosed for years and some of its symptoms can be combated with diet and exercise. Analysts are also unsure whether the FDA or insurers will require patients get a liver biopsy before treatment, which would limit uptake.', 'What’s more, popular weight loss drugs known as GLP-1 agonists are also being tested in NASH, making them potential rivals to Madrigal and others following in its footsteps. One study of Lilly’s drug tirzepatide could produce results before the FDA issues a verdict on resmetirom. — Ben Fidler ', 'In recent years, Merck has reprioritized cardiovascular disease research. An important step forward could come this quarter, should the FDA approve a drug known as sotatercept.', 'Sotatercept was originally developed by Acceleron Pharma and was once the focus of a partnership between the biotechnology company and Celgene before research was halted. The drug was revived when it showed promise in pulmonary arterial hypertension, a common and deadly type of high blood pressure in the lungs. Its progress led Merck to acquire Acceleron for $11.5 billion in 2021.', 'Positive Phase 3 study results Merck has since obtained could yield a “new direction” in treating PAH, a group of physicians wrote in an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Merck is counting on it, both to justify its investment in Acceleron and help replace the revenue it’ll lose when its lucrative cancer drug Keytruda goes off patent in 2028.', 'Yet sotatercept faces a crowded market with multiple other drugs and would-be competitors close behind, leading to questions about its commercial potential. On a conference call last year, Merck management claimed a “bolus of patients is closely waiting” for the drug’s approval. That confidence led Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch to suggest in December that sotatercept is one of the company’s “more underappreciated opportunities.”', 'The FDA will make a decision by March 26. — Ben Fidler ', 'In the late 1980s, a team of researchers led by the National Cancer Institute’s Steven Rosenberg explored whether a form of personalized cell therapy could be used to treat aggressive cancers like melanoma.', 'The technique they pioneered, which became known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL, therapy, has taken a circuitous journey in the 35-odd years since. While early attempts were inconsistent, subsequent testing has shown TIL therapy can shrink advanced tumors and even outperform other drugs.', 'By mid-February, the FDA will decide whether to approve the first industrialized TIL therapy, which was developed by Iovance for advanced melanoma.', 'Iovance’s own journey to get to this point has been prolonged by delays and last month the FDA halted testing of a separate Iovance TIL therapy in lung cancer. Analysts expect the melanoma review to remain on track, but the hold adds some new uncertainty to the FDA’s decision.', 'If approval is granted, Iovance will be under pressure to deliver. The company’s TIL therapy, called lifileucel, involves a bespoke manufacturing process that takes about three weeks. — Ned Pagliarulo', 'Regeneron has spent years trying to build a cancer drug business, but with mixed results. Though the company successfully developed a cancer immunotherapy, Libtayo, it was the sixth of its type to win U.S. approval. Libtayo sales are dwarfed by those of competitors, like Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, that bring in billions of dollars each year.', 'Regeneron is looking to a newer set of dual-acting drugs, known as bispecific antibodies, to better compete. The company has a pair in advanced testing for blood cancers and one, odronextamab, could be approved for follicular and diffuse large B cell lymphoma by the end of March.', 'From there, the company plans to develop combinations that are more potent while running tests in earlier treatment settings, executives have said.', 'But Regeneron is again trailing the competition, leading to skepticism from analysts that the drugs will be major revenue drivers. The FDA has already cleared multiple bispecific drugs for lymphoma that work similarly to odronextamab, for instance, and Regeneron hasn’t proven its drug is superior.', '“It remains to be seen how the adoption of [odronextamab] will compare,” wrote William Blair analyst Matt Phipps, in a December research note. — Ben Fidler ', 'Last year, the FDA made Sarepta’s gene therapy the first of its kind cleared for the progressive, muscle-wasting condition. But the approval was limited to a specific group of young boys who can still walk, and conditioned on the therapy succeeding in a confirmatory clinical trial. That study failed to hit its main goal in October, leaving Elevidys’ future unclear.', 'Sarepta claims that, despite the setback, there were enough encouraging findings to warrant the FDA expanding Elevidys’ clearance. While treatment didn’t lead to a meaningful difference over a placebo on a widely used test of motor function, Sarepta said treated patients consistently benefited on a variety of other measures.', 'Sarepta’s application to broaden Elevidys’ use is another test of the FDA’s flexibility in reviewing drugs for deadly conditions like Duchenne. The agency approved Elevidys despite questions about its benefits and previously indicated it may consider removing the drug from the market if the confirmatory study failed. But the regulator faces pressure from patient groups to act quickly, and some of its top officials have been closely involved in Elevidys’ review.', ""“Given the totality of the data, our understanding of the agency's interactions with Sarepta up until this point, and the unmet need in [Duchenne], we continue to believe that Elevidys will remain on the market with an expanded label,” wrote Leerink Partners analyst Joseph Schwartz, in December."", 'Sarepta has asked for a priority review, which, if accepted by the FDA, would begin a six-month evaluation. The FDA could decide whether to accept the request by late February. — Ben Fidler ', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.
