Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$83.26). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 0.2% of Charles Schwab's stake.In total, Charles Schwab insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. Specifically, insiders ditched US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Charles Schwab insiders own about US$9.9b worth of shares (which is 6.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Charles Schwab stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But it is good to see that Charles Schwab is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Charles Schwab you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But in the short term the market is a voting machine, and the share price movements may not reflect the underlying business performance. The Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) is down 22% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -22% once you include the dividend. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 22%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 19% in the last three years. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 12% in a month. However, we note the price may have been impacted by the broader market, which is down 6.0% in the same time period.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Acuity Brands To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Even though the Acuity Brands share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Given the yield is quite low, at 0.3%, we doubt the dividend can shed much light on the share price. Acuity Brands' revenue is actually up 16% over the last year. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Acuity Brands will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAcuity Brands shareholders are down 22% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -22%. So last year was actually even worse than the last five years, which cost shareholders 1.7% per year. It will probably take a substantial improvement in the fundamental performance for the company to reverse this trend.

4,5667fc57-23b9-3ae5-a8c4-ce7fc2200488,TMO,2023-01-01,Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) Latest Stock Performance Being Led By Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-110040739.html,1672570840,STORY,['TMO'],"[Most readers would already know that Thermo Fisher Scientific's (NYSE:TMO) stock increased by 5.3% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:16% = US$7.0b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Thermo Fisher Scientific's significant 29% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 34% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Thermo Fisher Scientific fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, Thermo Fisher Scientific has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 4.7%. Still, forecasts suggest that Thermo Fisher Scientific's future ROE will rise to 20% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), which is up 42%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 16% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 19% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for MetLife While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, MetLife failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 28% (annualized).Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We severely doubt anyone is particularly impressed with the modest 1.4% three-year revenue growth rate. While we don't have an obvious theory to explain the share price rise, a closer look at the data might be enlightening.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthMetLife is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, MetLife's TSR for the last 3 years was 58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that MetLife shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for MetLife (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  that you should be aware of.We will like MetLife better if we see some big insider buys.

8,f1ef64f9-a26d-3ba7-97ca-34916d46e6fc,O,2023-01-01,2023 will bring the true test of the West’s oil-war tactics,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2023-bring-true-test-west-192750203.html,1672575491,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[The west has been trying to cut Russia’s oil-export revenues without causing global prices to spike since February. Both aims are seemingly being achieved at present. Russia exports as much oil as before its invasion of Ukraine, but Urals crude, the main grade it pumps, trades at a 37% discount to Brent, the global benchmark, meaning Moscow gets a poor deal. Brent, meanwhile, has fallen to an annual low of around $80 a barrel (see chart), meaning consumers face less of an energy crunch.The EconomistLittle of this is down to Western efforts. On December 14th and 15th central banks in America, Britain and the eu announced interest-rate rises, and signalled more would come, sucking demand from the economy. China, reeling from soaring covid-19 cases, posted its worst factory and retail data in six months. Members of the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec) and its allies are producing nearly as much as before a cut to their collective target was announced in October, since most were already pumping below their quotas.The West’s boycott of Urals, which accounts for 10-15% of the world’s crude supply, is probably bringing its price down a bit, as the grade undercuts others. An exemption to Europe’s ban on insurance for tankers carrying Russian oil, which applies to buyers that agree to pay a maximum of $60 per barrel, may be helping to prevent a supply shock. But neither measure is having a huge impact. If economic or market conditions change, prices could jump.Moreover, financial punters seem to have had a greater hand than usual in depressing recent prices, which could portend a sudden upwards correction when the fundamentals of supply and demand kick back in. An industry source points to large “sell” orders being placed every day at 2pm London time in recent weeks. Events that should push up prices, such as the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline in America, one of the world’s largest, on December 9th, seem to have barely registered, notes Saad Rahim of Trafigura, a trading firm.Story continuesBy the second quarter of 2023 there may be another oil shortage. Industrial users in Europe are switching from natural gas to cheaper gasoil. Consumption in India and the Middle East is proving more resilient than expected. China’s reopening will probably fuel an economic rebound after cases peak.There are already signs that Europe’s insurance ban could end up proving more disruptive than expected. The iea, an official forecaster, reckons Russia will be forced to cut output by 1.6m b/d, to 9.6m b/d, by the second quarter. Loadings of a minor Russian grade called ESPO, which unlike Urals recently traded above $60, have nearly halved since December 5th, when the cap was introduced. Should rising oil demand push the price of Urals above $60, ship owners may well have second thoughts about carrying it, too.Russia has threatened to cut supply to countries that abide by the cap, and growth elsewhere is projected to be sluggish. A deficit in global supply would eat into already slim global stocks, which remain close to five-year lows, causing prices to rise still further. All this means that the true test of the West’s oil-war tactics will probably arrive next year.© 2022 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.From The Economist, published under licence.

Buffett also owns a stake in Chevron, which was the 17th best S&amp;P 500 performer in 2022 with a gain of about 50%.The energy sector finished the year up 56%, making it the only one to print positive gains for the year. Meanwhile, about 70% of S&amp;P 500 companies logged negative returns, making it all the more impressive for energy stocks to post such massive gains.Combined, the top 10 performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2022 added a total of $357 billion in market value.

12,f1ef64f9-a26d-3ba7-97ca-34916d46e6fc,FE,2023-01-01,2023 will bring the true test of the West’s oil-war tactics,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2023-bring-true-test-west-192750203.html,1672575491,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[The west has been trying to cut Russia’s oil-export revenues without causing global prices to spike since February. Both aims are seemingly being achieved at present. Russia exports as much oil as before its invasion of Ukraine, but Urals crude, the main grade it pumps, trades at a 37% discount to Brent, the global benchmark, meaning Moscow gets a poor deal. Brent, meanwhile, has fallen to an annual low of around $80 a barrel (see chart), meaning consumers face less of an energy crunch.The EconomistLittle of this is down to Western efforts. On December 14th and 15th central banks in America, Britain and the eu announced interest-rate rises, and signalled more would come, sucking demand from the economy. China, reeling from soaring covid-19 cases, posted its worst factory and retail data in six months. Members of the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec) and its allies are producing nearly as much as before a cut to their collective target was announced in October, since most were already pumping below their quotas.The West’s boycott of Urals, which accounts for 10-15% of the world’s crude supply, is probably bringing its price down a bit, as the grade undercuts others. An exemption to Europe’s ban on insurance for tankers carrying Russian oil, which applies to buyers that agree to pay a maximum of $60 per barrel, may be helping to prevent a supply shock. But neither measure is having a huge impact. If economic or market conditions change, prices could jump.Moreover, financial punters seem to have had a greater hand than usual in depressing recent prices, which could portend a sudden upwards correction when the fundamentals of supply and demand kick back in. An industry source points to large “sell” orders being placed every day at 2pm London time in recent weeks. Events that should push up prices, such as the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline in America, one of the world’s largest, on December 9th, seem to have barely registered, notes Saad Rahim of Trafigura, a trading firm.Story continuesBy the second quarter of 2023 there may be another oil shortage. Industrial users in Europe are switching from natural gas to cheaper gasoil. Consumption in India and the Middle East is proving more resilient than expected. China’s reopening will probably fuel an economic rebound after cases peak.There are already signs that Europe’s insurance ban could end up proving more disruptive than expected. The iea, an official forecaster, reckons Russia will be forced to cut output by 1.6m b/d, to 9.6m b/d, by the second quarter. Loadings of a minor Russian grade called ESPO, which unlike Urals recently traded above $60, have nearly halved since December 5th, when the cap was introduced. Should rising oil demand push the price of Urals above $60, ship owners may well have second thoughts about carrying it, too.Russia has threatened to cut supply to countries that abide by the cap, and growth elsewhere is projected to be sluggish. A deficit in global supply would eat into already slim global stocks, which remain close to five-year lows, causing prices to rise still further. All this means that the true test of the West’s oil-war tactics will probably arrive next year.© 2022 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.From The Economist, published under licence.

A sharp rise in workers testing positive for the virus has weighed on the country's demand for crude.The combination of a global recession and central bank interest-rate hikes next year could further suppress prices, even if the war between Russia and Ukraine drags on, strategists said.""In large part, oil prices have declined in recent months due to recessionary fears and increasing interest rates in many developed economies,"" said Jorge Leon, a senior oil markets research strategist at Rystad Energy.Story continues""A worsening of the situation in Ukraine could also provide bearish signals to the market as a result of the global economic slowdown,"" he told Insider.Natural gas prices soared in the summer too. Dutch TTF futures rose nearly 300% between February and late August as Russia cut off flows through key pipelines such as Nord Stream 1.But like oil, benchmark natural gas prices have retreated in the second half of the year to under 100 euros ($106) per megawatt hour. That means they are now up only around 10% from pre-invasion levels. The European Union asked its member states to try to reach their gas storage targets several months early, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Meanwhile, countries including Germany and Greece have bought giant floating terminals so that they can import liquefied natural gas by sea.""The gas crisis for this winter is over,"" Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen told Insider. ""The combination of very strong inventory levels and record shipments of LNG will likely prevent any risk to supply.""Food prices edge lowerUkraine is often described as ""the breadbasket of Europe"" because it produces and exports vast amounts of wheat and corn to the continent.Russia's invasion in February fueled fears that there would be a prolonged global food crisis that would push already-soaring inflation even higher.Wheat futures prices nearly doubled to spike at $14.25 per bushel two weeks after war broke out, while corn futures prices edged up 16% to $7.81 per bushel between February and July.But like oil and natural gas, both commodities now trade close to their pre-war levels.   Prices have fallen since July – the month that Turkey brokered a deal between Russia and the United Nations to allows key food exports to continue from three Ukrainian ports.""The UN plan, which also paves the way for Russian food and fertilizer to reach global markets, will help to stabilize spiraling food prices worldwide and stave off famine,"" the organization said in a statement.Euro bounces backThe euro plunged against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion and continued to struggle for most of 2022. War in Ukraine hammered investors' confidence in the Eurozone economy, while the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes made the dollar more attractive than the euro for investors seeking higher yields. The euro fell below parity with the greenback for the first time in 20 years on September 2,  and traded below 96 cents at the end of that month for its weakest level of 2022.But the euro has mounted a comeback in the final quarter of the year, rallying by over 10% to hit $1.06. The European Central Bank has signaled it'll bring in outsized rate hikes in 2023 to clamp down on inflation, while investors expect the Fed to ease up on tightening next year.Currencies also reflect an area's economic health.Russia stoked a European energy crisis earlier this year by slashing gas flows. But the cold season has been less chilly than expected, and that has limited Moscow's ability to keep disrupting the Eurozone economy, one strategist said.""The warmer start to the winter period alleviated some concerns about energy depletion and gas security,"" Oanda market analyst Craig Erlam told Insider.""Europe's probably still either in or heading for a recession – but it's not just about technical definitions, it's about the depths of said recession,"" he added. ""So that's helped to lift the Euro.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 poorest countries in the world.You might think that with the resources the world boasts right now, it is simply the proper usage of such resources which is why the success or failure of each country is based on its own performance and mistakes. Racists believe the truth to be even simpler; since most of the poorest countries in the world are located in Africa, these people believe that people who aren't white are simply inferior in every way, also pointing to most of the developed countries in the world having a population which is majority white.Of course, the truth is anything but the above. There are several major reasons which impact the success of a country. Before we talk about the present, let's first go to the past. European nations colonized most of the world centuries ago, with many countries only declaring independence in the last century. Let's consider India for example. According to a 2014 study, India was quite well off five centuries ago, before the British entered the country. While the British started trading in India much earlier, they became the dominant power in the country in 1757, after which it ruled the subcontinent for two centuries, in which wealth was plundered from India at a massive scale, while millions in the country were left destitute. Even though the British left India after dividing it into India and Pakistan in 1947, both countries still have a lot of catch up to do. While they may not be among the poorest countries in the world, and India's GDP may be competing with the biggest nations, poverty is still a huge issue with hundreds of millions living below the poverty line in the country due to inequality of resource distribution, with the country also being home to one of the wealthiest families in the world.50 poorest countries in the worldPixabay/Public DomainAnother study, conducted in 1996, researched the impact of colonization on Africa, where many countries were colonized by European powers. The study concluded that after considering everything, the impact of colonization on Africa's growth was overall negative, stating ""Finally, we show that variables capturing colonial heritage account for the different and negative performance of Africa relative to other continents are highly correlated with the Sub-Sahara dummy that other studies have used"".Story continuesWhile history and colonization have impacted the poorest countries in the world, there are other factors at play as well. According to another study conducted in 2019, stated that high-income countries realize the importance of research and development, and invest heavily in it, to come up with solutions to problems that exist right now. On the other hand, low income countries either do not give R&amp;D its due importance, or have too many other issues or too few resources to be able to properly allocate investments to R&amp;D. In 2019, global R&amp;D expenditure was $1.7 trillion and only 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of it, most of them being Western, developed nations. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage spend on R&amp;D meanwhile. While high income countries have outpaced poverty and infrastructure issues, low income countries are still impacted severely by these issues, not to mention malnutrition and food crisis, which takes up most of their resources. Low income countries also account for more than 85% of the global disease burden which again eats into the already meagre resources these countries have.Another reason that has affected the poorest countries in the world is industrialization. The first instance of industrialization, which transforms an economy from being agriculture dominated to becoming an industrial economy, took place in Western Europe and North America from the mid 18th to early 19th century. This gave these countries a massive advantage in being able to maximize income per person as opposed to other economies which were still mostly agrarian based, and hence, not as well-off. In the 20th century, countries in East Asia became industrialized as well, while Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa are currently in the process of undergoing industrialization. There are other issues as well that plague poorer countries including corruption and lack of implementation of laws, not to mention a lack of access to education, which is extremely important in enabling a country to break off its shackles and rising further.The above explanations show quite a gloomy picture of the poorest countries in the world, and make it seem almost impossible to get out of this situation. However, there are positive stories to focus on as well. When it gained independence in 1948, South Korea was home to a mostly agricultural based economy with low income and an impoverished population. However, from 1960 to 1996, the country underwent rapid growth which transformed it into an industrial society, which is home to some giants corporations including Samsung Group, KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) and POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX). One of the main reasons that the country has improved so much is because of its strong focus on high quality education which has been accessible to the vast majority of the population (see 25 most educated countries).Just like South Korea, there are many other nations which are working on improving their economies and developing strongly. This makes them prime for investment, but with additional risks. If you want a safe, steady investment, you can invest in Western Europe and North America, which are still growing but at low rates, and relatively free of any substantial risks. On the other hand, the poorest countries in the world generally have much higher growth rates as there is a lot more potential to grow substantially, with the risk that things might not pan out and even go in the other direction. When we discuss the list, we will mention the average 5 year growth rate of the country's GDP to display how ripe these nations could be for investment. We calculated the CAGR of each country's economy over the last five years, and five of the top 10 countries are from Africa, which is also home to several of the poorest countries in the world.To determine the poorest countries in the world, we have considered both their GDP and GDP per capita. There will be countries with higher GDP because of a bigger population but shouldn't be counted among the richest countries since their GDP per capita is quite low. This is why we've allocated 70% weightage to GDP per capita, with all data being taken from the World Bank. Most of these companies have a GDP which isn't even close to some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). So, without further ado, let's take a look at the countries which may not be doing so well right now, but could improve dramatically in the coming years and decades, starting with number 50:50. SamoaTotal GDP (in billions): $0.8GDP Per Capita: $3,8575 Year CAGR: -0.94%There are several Pacific islands in our list, including Samoa, which has struggled to fight poverty because of a vulnerability to natural disasters and rising unemployment. Tourism is an increasingly important sector of the economy in Samoa, with the country's beautiful beaches, cultural attractions, and friendly locals attracting visitors from around the world.49. ZimbabweTotal GDP (in billions): $28.4GDP Per Capita: $1,773.95 Year CAGR: 10.04%Zimbabwe is a country in southern Africa with a diverse economy that is driven by a number of different industries. One of the few countries with a CAGR of over 10%, Zimbabwe is still quite poor, with poverty increasing since the 1990s. Zimbabwe has a number of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, platinum, and chrome, and these resources are an important contributor to the economy.48. Republic of CongoTotal GDP (in billions): $13.4GDP Per Capita: $2,2905 Year CAGR: 3.8%The Republic of the Congo is a smaller country located on the Atlantic coast of central Africa. It is bordered by Gabon to the west, Cameroon to the northwest, the Central African Republic to the north, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the east. The capital city of the Republic of the Congo is Brazzaville. A low level of education and high unemployment has led to the Republic of Congo being among the poorest countries in the world.47. HaitiTotal GDP (in billions): $20.9GDP Per Capita: $1,8305 Year CAGR: 3.8%Haiti is a Caribbean country with a small and underdeveloped economy that is primarily based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Remittances from Haitian nationals living abroad are a significant contributor to the economy of Haiti. The 2010 earthquake absolutely devastated Haiti and the country hasn't recovered since. It is home to an extremely high percentage of crimes, with gangs basically ruling its capital. Haiti struggles with consistent and efficient energy generation and distribution, and the lack of access to affordable and reliable power hinders investment and business growth in the country. Most of the electricity in Haiti is generated using imported fossil fuels.46. SenegalTotal GDP (in billions): $27.6GDP Per Capita: $1,6375 Year CAGR: 5.6%Senegal is a West African country with a diversified economy. A low literacy rate and high unemployment rates have contributed to Senegal being among the poorest countries in the world.  Senegal has a trade agreement with the US. Under this trade agreement, Senegal exports processed foods, seafood, and cosmetics. Historically, France has been the main source of foreign direct investment in Senegal, but in recent years, China has also become a significant investor in the country.45. DjiboutiTotal GDP (in billions): $3.5GDP Per Capita: $3,1505 Year CAGR: 4.7%Djibouti is a small country in the Horn of Africa with a small and underdeveloped economy. Djibouti's land is quite arid which makes farming very difficult and with a lack of industrialization, there aren't many other opportunities for sustenance. Djibouti has a number of ports that are an important contributor to the economy, with the port of Doraleh being a major regional hub for trade.44. BhutanTotal GDP (in billions): $2.5GDP Per Capita: $3,2665 Year CAGR: 0.7%Bhutan is a small, landlocked country in South Asia with a small and underdeveloped economy. Bhutan's poverty is caused by the country not having many natural resources. Bhutan has a number of hydroelectric power plants that are an important contributor to the economy, with the country exporting a significant amount of electricity to India (see 20 countries that produce the most electricity).43. Timor-LesteTotal GDP (in billions): $3.6GDP Per Capita: $2,7415 Year CAGR: 17.8%Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) is a small, developing country in Southeast Asia with a small and underdeveloped economy. Timor-Leste has really uneven terrain, because of which farming and water-gathering are both quite difficult in a country where most of the people are dependent on agriculture. Timor-Leste has a number of oil and gas reserves that are an important contributor to the economy, with the country exporting a significant amount of oil and gas to other countries.42. NicaraguaTotal GDP (in billions): $14GDP Per Capita: $2,0465 Year CAGR: 0.3%Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western hemisphere and relies on the US for two thirds of its exports. Nicaragua is a significant exporter of coffee to the United States, with the country exporting a variety of coffee including specialty coffee, organic coffee, and fair trade coffee (see 12 countries that produce the best coffee). Nicaragua also exports a wide range of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables to the United States, including bananas, pineapples, avocados, and beans. Political instability, conflicts and inequality between urban and rural areas have all contributed to poverty in Nicaragua.41. MyanmarTotal GDP (in billions): $65.1GDP Per Capita: $1,2105 Year CAGR: 1.2%Myanmar (also known as Burma) is a country in Southeast Asia. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the world and the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims followed by a coup by one of the most brutal armies in the world means that there is very little likelihood that things will improve in the near future. Myanmar's main exports are petroleum gas, rice, textiles, and refined copper. China is Myanmar's main trading partner.40. EthiopiaTotal GDP (in billions): $111.3GDP Per Capita: $9255 Year CAGR: 6.4%Ethiopia is a landlocked country in East Africa with a large and underdeveloped economy. Ethiopia is one of the countries where colonization has been a major contributor to the place where it finds itself right now. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the economy of Ethiopia, with crops such as coffee, teff, and oilseeds being important exports.39. Cabo VerdeTotal GDP (in billions): $1.9GDP Per Capita: $3,2935 Year CAGR: 1.8%Cabo Verde (also known as Cape Verde) is a small, island nation in the Atlantic Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. Since 1990, Cabo Verde has experienced significant economic growth, largely due to the rapid expansion of tourism, which accounts for 25% of the country's GDP. Tourism is an increasingly important sector of the economy in Cabo Verde, with the country's stunning beaches, cultural attractions, and rich history attracting visitors from around the world.38. CambodiaTotal GDP (in billions): $27GDP Per Capita: $1,6255 Year CAGR: 4.0%Cambodia is a country in Southeast Asia. Cambodia's economy has grown at an average annual rate of 7.7% between 1998 and 2019, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. This growth has been driven by exports of garments and an increase in tourism. 18% of Cambodians live below the poverty line.37. MauritaniaTotal GDP (in billions): $10GDP Per Capita: $2,1665 Year CAGR: 8.0%Mauritania is a predominantly desert country (75% of the country is the Sahara Desert), with very little arable land (only 0.5% of the total land area) and large areas of pastoral land. Mauritania has a number of natural resources, including iron ore, gypsum, and oil, and these resources are a significant contributor to the country's economy. Mauritania's especially hydrocarbon sector has potential for growth. U.S. energy company Kosmos Energy discovered a large deposit of natural gas off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal in 2014.36. MicronesiaTotal GDP (in billions): $0.4GDP Per Capita: $3,5715 Year CAGR: 2.0%Federated States of Micronesia is a country in the Pacific Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. The Federated States of Micronesia's economy is primarily based on subsistence agriculture and fishing. The country lacks valuable mineral deposits, with the exception of high-grade phosphate. Micronesia is one of several Pacific islands where the governments do not properly spend funds received in aid, thereby exacerbating poverty instead of eradicating it.35. TanzaniaTotal GDP (in billions): $67.8GDP Per Capita: $1,0995 Year CAGR: 4.9%Tanzania is a country in East Africa with a large and underdeveloped economy. Tanzania has failed to improve its agricultural productivity over the past few decades which is why it is still among the poorest countries in the world. Nevertheless, Tanzania has experienced significant economic development in recent years, which has been fueled by its diverse natural resources and growing tourism industry.34. VanuatuTotal GDP (in billions): $1.0GDP Per Capita: $2,997Year CAGR: 1.7%Vanuatu is a small, island nation in the Pacific Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. The top three industries are agriculture, fishing, and tourism. Rural areas in Vanuatu have very limited infrastructure while the country's food security is also under threat from climate change.33. NepalTotal GDP (in billions): $36.3GDP Per Capita: $1,2085 Year CAGR: 4.6%Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia with a large and underdeveloped economy. Nepal's economic growth has been slower compared to many of its neighboring countries due to a history of political instability. Despite Nepal charging thousands of dollars to hundreds of climbers each year who want to climb Mount Everest, its location means that the development of infrastructure is more difficult while the country also needs to make more advances in agricultural technology.32. Solomon IslandsTotal GDP (in billions): $1.6GDP Per Capita: $2,3055 Year CAGR: 2.1%The Solomon Islands are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. Solomon Islands has been considered among the poorest countries in the world due to political unrest, natural disasters and a lack of access to education. More than three quarters of the labor force in this island nation is engaged in subsistence farming and fishing.31. BeninTotal GDP (in billions): $17.1GDP Per Capita: $1,3195 Year CAGR: 6.2%Benin is a country located in West Africa, bordered by Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east, and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north.

Buffett also owns a stake in Chevron, which was the 17th best S&amp;P 500 performer in 2022 with a gain of about 50%.The energy sector finished the year up 56%, making it the only one to print positive gains for the year. Meanwhile, about 70% of S&amp;P 500 companies logged negative returns, making it all the more impressive for energy stocks to post such massive gains.Combined, the top 10 performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2022 added a total of $357 billion in market value.

(TSE:ESM) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Euro Sun Mining Inc. operates as a gold and copper exploration and development mining company in Romania. The CA$21m market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$11m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$8.4m, as it approaches breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Euro Sun Mining's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Euro Sun Mining According to some industry analysts covering Euro Sun Mining, breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of US$13m in 2025. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 3 years from now. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 68% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Euro Sun Mining given that this is a high-level summary, though, take into account that typically a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.One thing we would like to bring into light with Euro Sun Mining is it currently has negative equity on its balance sheet. Accounting methods used to deal with losses accumulated over time can cause this to occur. This is because liabilities are carried forward into the future until it cancels. Oftentimes, losses exist only on paper but other times, it can be a red flag.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Euro Sun Mining which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

Click to skip ahead and see George Soros Net Worth and Top 5 Holdings Heading into 2023.Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) are some of the top holdings of billionaire hedge fund titan and somewhat controversial philanthropist George Soros.George Soros’ Soros Fund Management is the family office of the legendary money manager, which was closed to outside investors way back in 2011, when Soros was already 81 years old. Now 92, George Soros’ net worth is still significant at an estimated $8.5 billion according to Bloomberg, which ranks him as the 227th wealthiest people in the world.The fact George Soros’ net worth ranks him that low is testament to how rapidly the 0.01% are accumulating wealth, as $8.5 billion would’ve ranked him 80th back in 2010. In fact, Soros actually ranked 35th at that time according to Forbes, with a net worth of $14 billion, trailing only Warren Buffett among money managers. He’s since been surpassed by several other money managers, including Jim Simons, Ken Griffin, Ray Dalio, and Steve Cohen.Of course, closing your hedge fund to outside money and the enormous fees that can be generated from it will have that affect. But beyond that, Soros has also donated a significant portion of his wealth to various causes over the years, estimated to be as much as $32 billion. His family office now manages much of the wealth that has been poured into his philanthropic ventures, which have a combined $18 billion in assets under management. All told, Soros Fund Management has about $28 billion in assets under management.A lot of those philanthropic donations have been earmarked for the Open Society Foundations, which Soros himself founded in 1979 with the aim of combating authoritarian regimes and building free and open societies (as its name suggests), among other initiatives that generally promote human rights. The group hasn’t been without controversy though, particularly when it comes to allegations of political interference (though that’s kind of the group’s stated aim). It’s also been criticized for a lack of transparency about its funding and the groups it supports (and why) even as it pushes for governments to be more transparent.Story continuesMoving away from George Soros’ net worth and what he’s been up to with his considerable wealth, let’s dig into his top ten holdings heading into 2023. Unlike many money managers this year, which have reshaped their portfolios to be more defensive, Soros and the fund’s chief executive and chief investment officer, Dawn Fitzpatrick, have generally remained aggressive, with big investments in numerous growth stocks, including EV maker Rivian, which had been Soros’ top holding for the previous three quarters heading into Q3.Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio contained $5.86 billion in assets as of September 30, up from $5.62 billion a quarter earlier. About 35% of those assets were in consumer discretionary stocks, though the fund’s exposure to that sector is down considerably from 54% at the end of 2021. Finance, health, real estate, and tech stocks also constituted a noteworthy percentage of the fund’s asset allocation as of September 30.Let’s check out which stocks Soros and his team are banking on heading into 2023 and beyond.George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings Heading into 2023 George Soros of Soros Fund ManagementOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Soros Fund Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. Note that Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y), which ranked as Soros’ sixth-largest holding on September 30, has been omitted from the list given that the company was acquired by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in October and is no longer a public company. We did include two other top holdings of Soros which were recently acquired given their additions are more material to their acquirer’s operations.We follow hedge funds like Soros Fund Management because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.

(NASDAQ:RIVN), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent an eclectic mix of billionaire George Soros’ top ten holdings heading into 2023. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also surges into the top ten after Soros’ family office raised its stake in the tech giant by 1,806% during Q3 to over 1.01 million shares.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares got battered in 2022, losing 39% of their value, as investors worry about the state of the advertising market, which accounts for about 80% of Alphabet’s revenue. Not only is the overall state of advertising a concern, but more specifically Alphabet’s place within it, as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet’s collective control of the market has now slipped below 50%. Nonetheless, there’s little doubt that Alphabet will retain a strong grip on the advertising market for years to come, while its cloud and Web3 businesses help facilitate the company’s overall growth.Stewart Asset Management likes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ability to grow earnings even during recessionary periods, as discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“We invest in businesses with strong, resilient earnings growth which are less cyclical. In the pandemic recession of 2020, the aggregate earnings of the portfolios we manage did not decline year-over-year, and in fact grew, albeit modestly. Looking at the Great Recession which began at year-end 2007 and lasted to mid-year 2009 is helpful too. Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), then called Google, reported earnings that doubled from 2007 to 2010.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $97.5 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 119 Cloud-based customer management platform operator Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) further diversifies the investing icon’s top holdings. Soros Fund Management raised its stake in the company by 8% during Q3 to 677,579 shares.Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of Jim Cramer's 5 Comeback Stocks after the company’s shares got battered by 48% in 2022. Salesforce’s sales growth has ticked down this year amid a challenging recessionary environment that has companies pulling back on their spending somewhat, but it certainly hasn’t slowed enough to justify the massive pullback in the stock.During the nine months of 2022 between February and October, the company grew sales by 20% year-over-year, down from 25% growth during the same period a year earlier. And longer-term, Salesforce has a tremendous growth opportunity both in the U.S and abroad, with a total addressable market that the company estimates at $290 billion by 2026, about 9x greater than the revenue Salesforce is projected to pull in during its fiscal 2023 year ended January 31, 2023.Aristotle Atlantic sold off Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in Q3, expressing doubts about the company’s projected $50 billion FY26 revenue in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”8. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $103 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 86 Soros Fund Management cut its stake in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) by 21% during Q3 to 1.39 million shares, which wasn’t enough to knock the stock out of its top ten holdings. There’s been a 22% decline in hedge fund ownership of LBRDA since the end of 2020, when the stock was among the 30 most popular among hedge funds.Despite LBRDA shares sliding by 53% in 2022, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) continues to trade at a discount to its net asset value, which may be why Soros likes the stock as a long-term investment. One of the company’s primary assets is a 26% ownership stake in Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), which is being all but written off by investors due to that company’s lackluster short-term customer growth (or lack thereof).Weitz Investment Management took a deep dive into Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)’s Charter investment in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We believe this to be the case for Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) (owner of 26% of broadband provider Charter Communications). As one of the Fund›s largest positions and its outsized impact as the top detractor for the quarter and year-to-date periods, a more detailed discussion of our continued optimism is warranted.Investors have apparently extrapolated that Charter’s recent string of lackluster broadband customer growth portends zero (or negative) growth into perpetuity. Skeptics point to early customer wins for wireless broadband offerings and fiber-network operators’ plans to aggressively expand their footprints as evidence that Charter’s (and cable operators’, generally) ability to add subscribers is permanently impaired. We disagree. Wireless broadband will likely continue to win customers in areas where wired infrastructure is unavailable or by expanding the market to new customer segments (e.g., construction trailers, food trucks, etc.). That said, the carriers face an important trade-off, as fixed wireless is a lower-return usage of scarce network capacity. As fixed and mobile data usage inexorably grow, we believe carriers will prioritize their traditional mobility business at the expense of expanding their fixed wireless base. With respect to growing competition from fiber-to-the-home operators, Charter’s footprint is already roughly 40% overbuilt and has been competing successfully for over a decade. As fiber companies look to enact previously announced expansion plans, inflationary pressures for labor, equipment, and funding costs may reduce their ultimate appetites…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $108 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Soros Fund trimmed its stake in Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) by 10% during Q3 to 8.8 million shares. Nonetheless, the fund holds a nearly 5% stake in the company and the largest position in it among the select group of leading hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.If you’re of the mind that investing in a company that operates bowling centers isn’t an exciting or high-growth opportunity, you’re surely not alone, but Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) just might prove otherwise. There’s a reason BOWL shares crushed the broader market in 2022, gaining 53%, as the company continues to expand and grow at a rapid rate.In Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL)’s Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, the company revealed that it grew adjusted EBITDA ($65 million) by 11% year-over-year in its fiscal Q1 and by 162% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Its revenue has likewise surged by 56% compared to pre-pandemic levels in the first 18 weeks of its fiscal 2023 year, including a 36% jump in same-store sales. So Bowlero isn’t just growing compared to weaker pandemic comps or primarily due to its expansion (it has about 10% more bowling centers now than it did at the start of FY22, 325 in total); it’s pulling in significantly more revenue and generating far more cash across the board.6. Aramark (NYSE:ARMK)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $114 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 35 Soros’ stake in Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) was inched up by 2% during Q3, with the billionaire’s family office owning 3.66 million ARMK shares on September 30. Hedge fund ownership of the stock has risen during each of the past three quarters, climbing by 35% during that time.Philadelphia-based Aramark (NYSE:ARMK), which provides food, hospitality, and facilities services to a variety of industries, benefited greatly in its fiscal 2022 from continued reopenings in areas such as business and education.In its Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript, Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) noted that it generated about $790 million in net new business in its fiscal 2022 in terms of client retention, which was about 750% higher than its historical five-year average between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. So it continues to grow its business and retain both new and existing customers at strong rates (95%), which sets it up well to achieve its longer-term growth targets.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), and Rivian Automotive, Inc.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Microsoft’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Microsoft Is Microsoft Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $278.10, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from Microsoft?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 45%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Inflation, recession, and the Federal Reserve remain on the minds of every investor. As a result, the most important word in 2023 may very well be “patience.”Because of the need for patience next year, I’d encourage you to consider dividend stocks, which pay investors to wait for gains by stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividends can be a reliable source of income for investors. For investors who are in the wealth preservation stage, the stocks’ payouts can supplement other sources of retirement income. And for investors who are looking for growth stocks, reinvesting dividends gives you the ability to increase your total return.But in a volatile market like this, it’s important to choose high-quality stocks. Many of the dividend stocks on this list are part of the elite group of equities known as dividend aristocrats or dividend kings. Those terms refer to companies that have increased their dividend for 25 and 50 consecutive years, respectively. That makes their dividends about safe as you can get.So let’s get to it. Here are seven top dividend stocks for 2023.CVXChevron$177.80CCitigroup$44.65KOCoca-Cola$63.95MMM3M$119ABBVAbbVie$163ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$94.30DEDeere$432Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) stock was one of the market’s biggest winners, logging a gain of over 50% in 2022.It’s unlikely that the stock will deliver a similar return in 2023. If the economy tips into recession, as it seems likely to do, the demand for oil and the price of oil may drop. On the other hand, China’s reopening will be a positive catalyst for oil prices.But Chevron will also be affected by another catalyst. Specifically, the demand for natural gas is growing, and that’s increasing the demand for and the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can be shipped across the nation and to overseas markets like Europe.Story continuesThrough its shipping arm, Chevron Shipping Company, CVX is a leader in transporting LNG around the world.And Chevron is a dividend aristocrat, as it has increased its dividend for 35 consecutive years. CVX currently has a dividend yield of 3.16% and pays out $5.68 per share.Citigroup (C)A pink piggy bank wearing a grad cap sits on a wooden table in front of a chalkboard.Source: ShutterstockEarly predictions for 2023 suggest that investors should look at banks’ stocks because interest rates are rising, increasing banks’ net interest income.On the other hand, many analysts expect a recession to materialize next year, and that development is likely to increase defaults on loans and lower the demand for loansThose fears dragged on bank stocks in 2022. And Citigroup (NYSE:C) has been no exception, as C stock is down over 26% in 2022.However, Citigroup is starting to look more appetizing. One reason is that C has less exposure to consumer lending than the other big banks.And when you pair that lower risk profile with a valuation of just over six times its earnings and a dividend that currently yields 4.6%, you can see why Warren Buffett is investing in Citigroup.But does that mean that C stock can rise in 2023? Analysts seem to think that it can. Their average price target on the shares is $58.03 which is 30% above the stock’s current level.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.comMultiple lawsuits have weighed heavily on 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock in 2022. In fact, MMM stock is trading at levels that investors haven’t seen since 2014.So it might be easy to say that the worst is over for the shares. But the reality is that MMM stock may continue to struggle. And InvestorPlace contributors have widely different opinions on the name.Bulls note that the stock is trading for less than 11 times its earnings, while the company should benefit from the current “onshoring” trade in the U.S.Bears say that the company can’t get investors excited even with its low valuation and its status as a dividend king. Indeed, despite the company’s declining stock price, it has increased its dividend for 64 consecutive years and has a yield of 4.96%.I’ll throw my hat in with the bulls because, despite the company’s legal issues, its earnings have remained remaining steady. And that leads me to believe that the shares are undervalued.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is up about 8% in 2022. But that doesn’t mean it’s been a smooth ride for the stock. KO stock was down 8% for the year as recently as October 2022. But since then, the shares have rocketed 18% higher.That puts KO stock near its 52-week high.  But how will the shares fare in 2023?One criticism of Coca-Cola is that it isn’t as diversified as its competitor, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). But Coca-Cola’s earnings show why it is a legitimate defensive stock.With a profit margin of over 23%, investors know that Coke has pricing power. That means there’s little danger of the company’s earnings falling meaningfully anytime soon. That also means the company will probably continue to raise its dividend.AbbVie (ABBV)abbvie website and logo on mobile phone. ABBV stockSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comIs the worst over for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)? For much of 2022, investors have been focused on the fact that the company’s patent on Humira, its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug, was going to expire.Their concerns are legitimate. Humira was responsible for 36% of the company’s total revenue in the first half of the year. But two of its new drugs– Skyrizi and Rinvoq — are expected to compensate for the loss of much of Humira’s sales, as analysts, on average, expect those two drugs to deliver $15 billion of annual revenue by 2025.That should take care of any concerns about the company’s earnings. And earnings growth is one of the key predictors of stock prices. That explains why ABBV stock has risen 21% in 2022.Plus with AbbVie, investors get a newly minted dividend king. AbbVie has increased its dividend in each of the last 50 consecutive years. It currently pays out an impressive $5.64 per share annually. And it has an equally impressive dividend yield of 3.64%.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland’s (NYSE:ADM) shareholders have had a great year, but the stock has been somewhat volatile. Concerns about the global food supply sent ADM stock to an all-time high in April after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.However, worries about a global recession pushed the stock lower. And it wasn’t until October that the shares reclaimed their April levels. That kind of price movement is odd for a low beta stock. But with the stock near its 52-week high, it may become more stable next year.Moreover, investors will be looking to own defensive stocks in 2023, and ADM stock fits that description very well.  Sadly, the war in Ukraine is likely to continue to disrupt the global food supply. That means that Archer-Daniels-Midland’s earnings will continue to rise at a time when many analysts are predicting that an earnings recession could materialize.And the company is on the cusp of becoming a dividend king as it has increased its dividend for the last 49 years. ADM has a dividend yield of 1.67%.Deere &amp; Co. (DE)Deere equipment in harvested fieldSource: Deere &amp; CompanySimilar to Archer-Daniels-Midland, John Deere (NYSE:DE) stock soared early in 2022 on concerns about the global food supply.But as attention turned to earnings, DE stock dropped as its bottom line fell even as its revenue continued to climb. However, in its most recent reported quarter, its bottom line resumed growing year-over-year. And that has pushed DE stock back to its all-time high. Moreover, the stock has recently consolidated into a bullish pattern that suggests a sharp move higher may be in the cards.Nobody will ever confuse DE stock with a tech stock, but the company is a leader in autonomous farming equipment. The practical applications of that equipment make DE an intriguing choice as one of my dividend stock predictions in 2023.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had LONG positions in CVX and MMM.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) which saw its share price drive 129% higher over five years. On top of that, the share price is up 16% in about a quarter.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, TransDigm Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 18% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TransDigm Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think TransDigm Group will grow revenue in the future.A Dividend LostThe share price return figures discussed above don't include the value of dividends paid previously, but the total shareholder return (TSR) does. By accounting for the value of dividends paid, the TSR can be seen as a more complete measure of the value a company brings to its shareholders. TransDigm Group's TSR over the last 5 years is 164%; better than its share price return. Although the company had to cut dividends, it has paid cash to shareholders in the past.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that TransDigm Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.8% over the last year. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 21% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with TransDigm Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Click to skip ahead and see Citadel Stock Holdings: 5 Biggest Energy Stocks.FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) are three of the top Citadel stock holdings in the energy space among the fund’s non-options based holdings.Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is one of the 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM, with assets under management of more than $50 billion heading into 2023. The multi-strategy fund was in the midst of one of its best and most profitable years ever through November, with its flagship fund having gained 32% despite the market turmoil.With Citadel’s stock holdings performing so well, the fund planned to return $7 billion in profits to its clients early in 2023. The firm returned a total of $11 billion in profits to clients between 2017 and 2021. Citadel was already the second-most profitable hedge fund manager of all time as of 2021 according to LCH Investments, trailing only Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, which also got off a very strong start in 2022 but faltered in the second-half of the year.Citadel has its hands in all aspects of the financial arena, including credit, fixed income, macro, and commodities, which has helped it capitalize on various opportunities over the years. But Citadel’s stock holdings have been the multi-strategy fund’s bread and butter, having enjoyed a remarkable run of success dating back to just after the financial crisis, having gained at least 11% every year since suffering a devastating 54% loss during the crisis.Due to the fund’s heavy focus on options trading, its 13F portfolio value actually dwarfs its AUM in size, checking in at $439 billion at the end of September, up from $390 billion a quarter earlier. Given its gigantic portfolio, which contains tens of thousands of holdings, the Citadel’s exposure to various sectors changed very little quarter to quarter or even year to year.Story continuesCitadel has traditionally had more exposure to the finance, healthcare, tech, and consumer discretionary sectors than any other, while also having noteworthy holdings in energy, consumer staples, industrial, and communications stocks. In this article we’ll take a look at Citadel’s biggest stock holdings in the energy space as of September 30.Citadel Stock Holdings: 10 Biggest Energy StocksKen Griffin of Citadel Investment GroupOur MethodologyThe following Citadel stock holdings data is gathered from Citadel Investment Group’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. As we don’t typically cover options positions, we have scoured deep into Citadel’s portfolio to uncover the fund’s ten biggest non-options-based energy holdings.We follow hedge funds like Citadel Investment Group because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns. All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Citadel Stock Holdings: 10 Biggest Energy Stocks10. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $110 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45 Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) rank near the top of the list of Citadel stock holdings in terms of biggest energy stocks. Just grabbing a spot inside the top ten is First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), which was one of the top performing stocks of 2022, gaining 69%. Citadel trimmed its long position in First Solar by 6% during Q3 to 831,771 shares and also has large positions of both put and call options on the stock.First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the 5 Best Solar Energy Stocks to Invest In Heading into 2023 as evidenced by the huge influx of smart money into the stock during Q3. There was a 73% jump in hedge fund ownership of the stock during the quarter, which included Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Zach Schreiber’s Point State Capital adding FSLR to their 13F portfolios.There has been a great deal of euphoria around solar stocks like First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) this year given the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to pour billions of dollars into climate change-focused initiatives. However, First Solar’s performance has been criticized by some analysts this year, as the company failed to generate positive free cash flow despite the most favorable pricing environment for solar modules in more than a decade.9. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $130 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is one of the top Citadel stock holdings, jumping into the top ten biggest energy holdings of Ken Griffin’s fund after it raised its stake in the company by 1,562% during Q3 to over 3.47 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of EXC took a big drop during Q1 and stayed flat during Q2, but rebounded during Q3, rising by 26%. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners owns by far the largest Exelon stake as of September 30, holding nearly 21.4 million shares.Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC), a utility services holding company with more than 10 million customers, is in the midst of implementing substantial improvements to its infrastructure in an effort to boost its reliability, investing $6.9 billion on the initiatives. The company projects to grow EPS by 6% to 8% over the next three years.While Exelon was hit with a wave of price target downgrades from analysts in November, they by and large remain bullish on the company’s operational performance, growth opportunities, and low-risk profile. The recent leadership turnovers, including the appointment of both a new COO and CFO, as well as adjustments for seasonality, influenced some of the downgrades.The ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is now being seen as a more premium player in the utilities space, as it discussed in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”8. Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $135 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27 Citadel now owns the biggest stake in Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database after raising its stake in the company by 290% during Q3 to 1.57 million shares. Former top shareholder AQR Capital raised its ED position by a modest 6% during the quarter to end September with 1.44 million shares.One of the 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED) is approaching the rarified air of Dividend King status, having raised its annual dividend payouts for 48 straight years. The company’s dividend history stretches back much farther than that, all the way to the 19th century in fact, as it’s been making payouts since 1885. Its shares currently yield 3.32%.Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED) recently announced that it will sell off its green energy business for $6.8 billion in a move that will allow it to pay down some of its debt and begin buying back more of its shares. It will also spare the company from having to invest in the growth initiatives for that business, which may have required it to take on more debt or issue more equity. The company instead plans to focus on investing in regulated utilities.7. Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $135 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 51 Citadel powered up its Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) position something fierce during Q3, raising it by 3,330% to over 22 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of SWN sank to an all-time low at the end of 2019 but has rebounded in a big way this year, nearly doubling during the first three quarters of 2022.Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) is one of the top natural gas producers in the U.S., with prime acreage at two of the most prominent shale gas basins in the country. Citi analyst Paul Diamond cited fundamental concerns with those basins in a recent report however, in which he downgraded SWN to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’ with a $6.50 price target.Those concerns appear to have been somewhat warranted as a record decline in supplies from the Appalachian Basin during the winter storm that swept much of the country in late December put tremendous strain on the power grid. Well freeze offs and mechanical issues were some of the reasons behind the 27% decline in production that was estimated by BloombergNEF.Greenlight Capital calculated Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN)’s PV-104 value at $13.83 per share in its Q1 2022 investor letter, more than double what shares currently trade hands for:“SWN is the second largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. The company is well-situated to satisfy growing domestic and export demand. Over the short, medium and long term, Europe now intends to reduce its reliance on Russian energy and increase its use of U.S. LNG. Based on its 2021 year-end reserves – which assumed a $3.60/MMBtu long-term natural gas price – SWN has a PV-104 value of $13.83 per share. By the end of the first quarter, the U.S. natural gas 5-year forward curve averaged $4.28/MMBtu, while international seaborne LNG was close to $20/MMBtu. Over the intermediate term, with the benefit of substantial global investment in infrastructure, we expect prices for U.S. and international natural gas to converge. We acquired our shares at an average price of $6.58. SWN shares ended the quarter at $7.17.”6. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $147 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 46 Closing out the first half of the list of Citadel’s biggest energy stock holdings is Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), which the fund raised its stake in by 6% during Q3, lifting its share count to 6.99 million. Howard Marks’ Oaktree Capital has owned the largest stake in VST dating back to the second half of 2018, though its 13F exposure to the stock of 5.85% is about half what it was in 2018.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) plans to fully capitalize on the Inflation Reduction Act, with the goal of eventually retiring its coal plants and investing heavily in solar and battery power in the coming years and decades. It is guiding to retire 8,000 MW of fossil-fuel powered plants by 2027, to be replaced in part by 1,213 MW of battery storage by 2026. Longer-term, the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.The Legacy Ridge Capital Partners Equity Fund believes Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s discount to intrinsic value is more attractive than ever, as it laid out in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We had a hard time deciding which company we should discuss in this letter. By just about every metric, all our holdings are cheap from both a relative and absolute perspective – especially compared to the performance of commodity prices and the recent pullback in the overall complex of energy stocks. For the first six months of 2022, oil was up 41%, natural gas up 45%, natural gas liquids up 34%, and the futures curve for electricity (in the two biggest deregulated power markets) is up ~30%, but our holdings were only up a measly ~1% by mid-year! The point is all our positions are investment stories worth telling.However, Vistra Corp stands out among the names we own. First, the market environment has improved materially over a multi-year basis, which will enhance VST’s ability to mint cash and at the same time underscores the longevity of VST’s asset base. Second, VST’s market value has remained flat, despite shrinking the share count by nearly 15% since adopting a transformational capital allocation strategy. The combination of those two factors results in ~50% more value in a VST share today than just six months ago.The bottom line is that the discount to intrinsic value of VST’s equity has become more attractive than ever. To better understand the two broader points, as well as our heightened conviction, it’s worth providing a brief history of the IPPs and summarizing the original VST investment thesis…” (Click here to see the full text)Click the link below to see where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), and FirstEnergy Corp.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 82% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-largely-120027931.html,1672574427,STORY,['AMGN'],"[If you want to know who really controls Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amgen. View our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Amgen does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amgen's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amgen. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.4% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of AmgenWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Amgen Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$221m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amgen. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Amgen  you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Here are the five biggest merger deals of the year, as covered first on InvestingPro+.1. Microsoft-Activision BuyoutThe year's biggest deal is a knotty one: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in January agreed to buy video game publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) for $68.7 billion in cash, or $95 per share, sending Activision shares soaring from their prior level around $65.But earlier this month the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, arguing that it would ""harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets"" and allow Microsoft to ""suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.”A private consumer lawsuit was filed against Microsoft later in December, as well, also on anticompetitive grounds. The first pre-trial hearing for the FTC case is set for Jan. 3.The deal, if not ultimately blocked, would provide Microsoft with a vast library of popular video-game franchises and make it the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) and Sony (NYSE:SONY).Activision shares still ended the year up 13.5%. Microsoft lost 28.4%.2. Broadcom-VMware BuyoutThe second-biggest deal of 2022, Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) May pact to buy VMware (NYSE:VMW) for some $61 billion in cash and stock, is also facing regulatory scrutiny.The European Commission this month opened an ""in-depth investigation"" into the proposed merger, saying it is ""particularly concerned that the transaction would allow Broadcom to restrict competition in the market for certain hardware components which interoperate with VMware's software."" The EC has until May 11, 2023 to reach a decision.Story continuesBritain's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, also said in November that it was launching a probe into the deal.Wall Street was positive on the potential deal, with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in particular saying, ""If VMware is acquired, we see cost reduction and improving operating efficiency as a potential outcome.”VMware added 3.9% for the year. Broadcom slid 15.7%.3. Musk-Twitter BuyoutComing in at number three was billionaire Elon Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter at $54.20 per share. The agreement, inked in April, was completed only in late October after a protracted legal battle prompted by Musk's attempt to abandon the deal.Musk's chaotic reign since October was characterized by Wedbush as a ""nightmare"" for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders. Among other things, Musk unloaded billions of dollars in Tesla stock, which he told Twitter employees he did in order to ""save Twitter,"" CNBC reported. Shares of the Musk-led Tesla have lost an astounding 69.2% for 2022.Musk last week said he would step down as Twitter CEO once he finds a replacement. Wedbush said this should occur by the end of January in order for Tesla to recover in the new year.4. Hamm Family-Continental Resources BuyoutNext on the list is Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) founder Harold Hamm's October agreement to take the company private: $74.28 a share for the stock not already owned by him or his family trust, putting Continental at a valuation of some $27 billion.The final numbers were a sweetened version of the deal Hamm first offered in June, when he proposed $70 per share, at which point the stock had been trading at around $64. The deal closed in November.5. Amgen-Horizon Therapeutics BuyoutRounding out the biggest deals was Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) December deal to snap up Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP) for $116.50 per share, or $26 billion - a roughly 20% premium to Horizon's $97.29 closing price in the session before the announcement. If completed, Horizon would become Amgen’s largest-ever acquisition.Amgen said it expects to complete the deal in the first half of 2023. Amgen CEO Robert Bradway said the buyout is a move that is ""consistent with our strategy of delivering long-term growth by providing innovative medicines that address the needs of patients who suffer from serious diseases.""Horizon shares jumped more than 15% on the news and were up 5.4% for the year. Amgen slipped marginally on the announcement but gained 15.9% for 2022.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingPro+Related Articles5 biggest deals of 2022: Musk's Twitter buyout, Microsoft-ActivisionZenseact becomes fully owned subsidiary of Volvo CarsAnalysis-Citgo may face new upheaval under Venezuela's political changes]"
34,74f9bfa5-2994-3af5-9cbb-fa7c27b59ea9,M,2023-01-01,50 Poorest Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/50-poorest-countries-world-183713344.html,1672511833,STORY,['M'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 50 poorest countries in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 poorest countries in the world.You might think that with the resources the world boasts right now, it is simply the proper usage of such resources which is why the success or failure of each country is based on its own performance and mistakes. Racists believe the truth to be even simpler; since most of the poorest countries in the world are located in Africa, these people believe that people who aren't white are simply inferior in every way, also pointing to most of the developed countries in the world having a population which is majority white.Of course, the truth is anything but the above. There are several major reasons which impact the success of a country. Before we talk about the present, let's first go to the past. European nations colonized most of the world centuries ago, with many countries only declaring independence in the last century. Let's consider India for example. According to a 2014 study, India was quite well off five centuries ago, before the British entered the country. While the British started trading in India much earlier, they became the dominant power in the country in 1757, after which it ruled the subcontinent for two centuries, in which wealth was plundered from India at a massive scale, while millions in the country were left destitute. Even though the British left India after dividing it into India and Pakistan in 1947, both countries still have a lot of catch up to do. While they may not be among the poorest countries in the world, and India's GDP may be competing with the biggest nations, poverty is still a huge issue with hundreds of millions living below the poverty line in the country due to inequality of resource distribution, with the country also being home to one of the wealthiest families in the world.50 poorest countries in the worldPixabay/Public DomainAnother study, conducted in 1996, researched the impact of colonization on Africa, where many countries were colonized by European powers. The study concluded that after considering everything, the impact of colonization on Africa's growth was overall negative, stating ""Finally, we show that variables capturing colonial heritage account for the different and negative performance of Africa relative to other continents are highly correlated with the Sub-Sahara dummy that other studies have used"".Story continuesWhile history and colonization have impacted the poorest countries in the world, there are other factors at play as well. According to another study conducted in 2019, stated that high-income countries realize the importance of research and development, and invest heavily in it, to come up with solutions to problems that exist right now. On the other hand, low income countries either do not give R&amp;D its due importance, or have too many other issues or too few resources to be able to properly allocate investments to R&amp;D. In 2019, global R&amp;D expenditure was $1.7 trillion and only 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of it, most of them being Western, developed nations. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage spend on R&amp;D meanwhile. While high income countries have outpaced poverty and infrastructure issues, low income countries are still impacted severely by these issues, not to mention malnutrition and food crisis, which takes up most of their resources. Low income countries also account for more than 85% of the global disease burden which again eats into the already meagre resources these countries have.Another reason that has affected the poorest countries in the world is industrialization. The first instance of industrialization, which transforms an economy from being agriculture dominated to becoming an industrial economy, took place in Western Europe and North America from the mid 18th to early 19th century. This gave these countries a massive advantage in being able to maximize income per person as opposed to other economies which were still mostly agrarian based, and hence, not as well-off. In the 20th century, countries in East Asia became industrialized as well, while Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa are currently in the process of undergoing industrialization. There are other issues as well that plague poorer countries including corruption and lack of implementation of laws, not to mention a lack of access to education, which is extremely important in enabling a country to break off its shackles and rising further.The above explanations show quite a gloomy picture of the poorest countries in the world, and make it seem almost impossible to get out of this situation. However, there are positive stories to focus on as well. When it gained independence in 1948, South Korea was home to a mostly agricultural based economy with low income and an impoverished population. However, from 1960 to 1996, the country underwent rapid growth which transformed it into an industrial society, which is home to some giants corporations including Samsung Group, KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) and POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX). One of the main reasons that the country has improved so much is because of its strong focus on high quality education which has been accessible to the vast majority of the population (see 25 most educated countries).Just like South Korea, there are many other nations which are working on improving their economies and developing strongly. This makes them prime for investment, but with additional risks. If you want a safe, steady investment, you can invest in Western Europe and North America, which are still growing but at low rates, and relatively free of any substantial risks. On the other hand, the poorest countries in the world generally have much higher growth rates as there is a lot more potential to grow substantially, with the risk that things might not pan out and even go in the other direction. When we discuss the list, we will mention the average 5 year growth rate of the country's GDP to display how ripe these nations could be for investment. We calculated the CAGR of each country's economy over the last five years, and five of the top 10 countries are from Africa, which is also home to several of the poorest countries in the world.To determine the poorest countries in the world, we have considered both their GDP and GDP per capita. There will be countries with higher GDP because of a bigger population but shouldn't be counted among the richest countries since their GDP per capita is quite low. This is why we've allocated 70% weightage to GDP per capita, with all data being taken from the World Bank. Most of these companies have a GDP which isn't even close to some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). So, without further ado, let's take a look at the countries which may not be doing so well right now, but could improve dramatically in the coming years and decades, starting with number 50:50.

Cryptocurrency prices have plummeted from their former highs and mainstream interest in digital collectibles has waned, bringing down NFT prices.But the extended crypto winter has come with a potential silver lining – tax-loss harvesting, where NFT enthusiasts can sell their no longer valuable JPEGs and claim losses to offset their tax bill.Enter Unsellable, a platform launched last month that acquires “worthless” NFTs for the cost of gas plus a few bucks. The site functions as instant liquidity for otherwise, as the name suggests, unsellable NFTs, providing a quick way for NFT investors to capture their losses.“Think of us as Web3 junk removal,” it says on the website. At the time of writing, the service has so far purchased over 9,300 NFTs, according to Etherscan.The most valuable NFT in the Unsellable Collection on OpenSea so far is Army of the Dead #78, a skeleton-themed PFP that sold for over 3.6 wrapped ether (wETH) in January 2022. At the time of sale, when ETH was worth around $3,300, the NFT was valued at about $12,000. Today, as the price of ETH has fallen sharply, that same token is only worth $4,330.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The majority of NFTs purchased by the site are derivative projects – meaning, collections based on other popular projects that are often made worse. These include Lost Nouns, a derivative of Nouns, Anatomy Science Ape Club, a derivative of BAYC and Baby Goblinz, a play on Goblintown.The platform also allows users to sell their no-longer-wanted NFTs in bulk. One collector sold dozens of NFTs from the GoopGirls collection, along with others, in a single transaction, paying only 0.05 ETH (about $65) plus gas fees.The platform’s popularity comes as once-profitable traders seek to cut their losses. Prices for most NFTs and cryptocurrencies were at their dollar-value peak last December and January, with NFTs being hit especially hard. The boom in prices for NFTs also coincided with a peak in trading volume, meaning most NFTs purchased at the time were at prices higher than current values.Read more: How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto]"

Euro Sun Mining Inc. operates as a gold and copper exploration and development mining company in Romania. The CA$21m market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$11m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$8.4m, as it approaches breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Euro Sun Mining's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Euro Sun Mining According to some industry analysts covering Euro Sun Mining, breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of US$13m in 2025. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 3 years from now. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 68% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Euro Sun Mining given that this is a high-level summary, though, take into account that typically a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Patterson Companies with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies How Quickly Is Patterson Companies Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Recognition must be given to the that Patterson Companies has grown EPS by 51% per year, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Patterson Companies reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Patterson Companies.Story continuesAre Patterson Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Patterson Companies followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. To be specific, they have US$23m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.8% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Patterson Companies, with market caps between US$2.0b and US$6.4b, is around US$6.6m.Patterson Companies' CEO took home a total compensation package of US$2.6m in the year prior to April 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Patterson Companies Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Patterson Companies' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. Patterson Companies is certainly doing some things right and is well worth investigating. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Patterson Companies (at least 2 which are significant)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

39,74f9bfa5-2994-3af5-9cbb-fa7c27b59ea9,MA,2023-01-01,50 Poorest Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/50-poorest-countries-world-183713344.html,1672511833,STORY,"['PL=F', 'HG=F', 'LC=F', 'GC=F', 'FC=F', 'NG=F', 'CC=F']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 50 poorest countries in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 poorest countries in the world.You might think that with the resources the world boasts right now, it is simply the proper usage of such resources which is why the success or failure of each country is based on its own performance and mistakes. Racists believe the truth to be even simpler; since most of the poorest countries in the world are located in Africa, these people believe that people who aren't white are simply inferior in every way, also pointing to most of the developed countries in the world having a population which is majority white.Of course, the truth is anything but the above. There are several major reasons which impact the success of a country. Before we talk about the present, let's first go to the past. European nations colonized most of the world centuries ago, with many countries only declaring independence in the last century. Let's consider India for example. According to a 2014 study, India was quite well off five centuries ago, before the British entered the country. While the British started trading in India much earlier, they became the dominant power in the country in 1757, after which it ruled the subcontinent for two centuries, in which wealth was plundered from India at a massive scale, while millions in the country were left destitute. Even though the British left India after dividing it into India and Pakistan in 1947, both countries still have a lot of catch up to do. While they may not be among the poorest countries in the world, and India's GDP may be competing with the biggest nations, poverty is still a huge issue with hundreds of millions living below the poverty line in the country due to inequality of resource distribution, with the country also being home to one of the wealthiest families in the world.50 poorest countries in the worldPixabay/Public DomainAnother study, conducted in 1996, researched the impact of colonization on Africa, where many countries were colonized by European powers. The study concluded that after considering everything, the impact of colonization on Africa's growth was overall negative, stating ""Finally, we show that variables capturing colonial heritage account for the different and negative performance of Africa relative to other continents are highly correlated with the Sub-Sahara dummy that other studies have used"".Story continuesWhile history and colonization have impacted the poorest countries in the world, there are other factors at play as well. According to another study conducted in 2019, stated that high-income countries realize the importance of research and development, and invest heavily in it, to come up with solutions to problems that exist right now. On the other hand, low income countries either do not give R&amp;D its due importance, or have too many other issues or too few resources to be able to properly allocate investments to R&amp;D. In 2019, global R&amp;D expenditure was $1.7 trillion and only 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of it, most of them being Western, developed nations. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage spend on R&amp;D meanwhile. While high income countries have outpaced poverty and infrastructure issues, low income countries are still impacted severely by these issues, not to mention malnutrition and food crisis, which takes up most of their resources. Low income countries also account for more than 85% of the global disease burden which again eats into the already meagre resources these countries have.Another reason that has affected the poorest countries in the world is industrialization. The first instance of industrialization, which transforms an economy from being agriculture dominated to becoming an industrial economy, took place in Western Europe and North America from the mid 18th to early 19th century. This gave these countries a massive advantage in being able to maximize income per person as opposed to other economies which were still mostly agrarian based, and hence, not as well-off. In the 20th century, countries in East Asia became industrialized as well, while Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa are currently in the process of undergoing industrialization. There are other issues as well that plague poorer countries including corruption and lack of implementation of laws, not to mention a lack of access to education, which is extremely important in enabling a country to break off its shackles and rising further.The above explanations show quite a gloomy picture of the poorest countries in the world, and make it seem almost impossible to get out of this situation. However, there are positive stories to focus on as well. When it gained independence in 1948, South Korea was home to a mostly agricultural based economy with low income and an impoverished population. However, from 1960 to 1996, the country underwent rapid growth which transformed it into an industrial society, which is home to some giants corporations including Samsung Group, KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) and POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX). One of the main reasons that the country has improved so much is because of its strong focus on high quality education which has been accessible to the vast majority of the population (see 25 most educated countries).Just like South Korea, there are many other nations which are working on improving their economies and developing strongly. This makes them prime for investment, but with additional risks. If you want a safe, steady investment, you can invest in Western Europe and North America, which are still growing but at low rates, and relatively free of any substantial risks. On the other hand, the poorest countries in the world generally have much higher growth rates as there is a lot more potential to grow substantially, with the risk that things might not pan out and even go in the other direction. When we discuss the list, we will mention the average 5 year growth rate of the country's GDP to display how ripe these nations could be for investment. We calculated the CAGR of each country's economy over the last five years, and five of the top 10 countries are from Africa, which is also home to several of the poorest countries in the world.To determine the poorest countries in the world, we have considered both their GDP and GDP per capita. There will be countries with higher GDP because of a bigger population but shouldn't be counted among the richest countries since their GDP per capita is quite low. This is why we've allocated 70% weightage to GDP per capita, with all data being taken from the World Bank. Most of these companies have a GDP which isn't even close to some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). So, without further ado, let's take a look at the countries which may not be doing so well right now, but could improve dramatically in the coming years and decades, starting with number 50:50. SamoaTotal GDP (in billions): $0.8GDP Per Capita: $3,8575 Year CAGR: -0.94%There are several Pacific islands in our list, including Samoa, which has struggled to fight poverty because of a vulnerability to natural disasters and rising unemployment. Tourism is an increasingly important sector of the economy in Samoa, with the country's beautiful beaches, cultural attractions, and friendly locals attracting visitors from around the world.49. ZimbabweTotal GDP (in billions): $28.4GDP Per Capita: $1,773.95 Year CAGR: 10.04%Zimbabwe is a country in southern Africa with a diverse economy that is driven by a number of different industries. One of the few countries with a CAGR of over 10%, Zimbabwe is still quite poor, with poverty increasing since the 1990s. Zimbabwe has a number of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, platinum, and chrome, and these resources are an important contributor to the economy.48. Republic of CongoTotal GDP (in billions): $13.4GDP Per Capita: $2,2905 Year CAGR: 3.8%The Republic of the Congo is a smaller country located on the Atlantic coast of central Africa. It is bordered by Gabon to the west, Cameroon to the northwest, the Central African Republic to the north, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the east. The capital city of the Republic of the Congo is Brazzaville. A low level of education and high unemployment has led to the Republic of Congo being among the poorest countries in the world.47. HaitiTotal GDP (in billions): $20.9GDP Per Capita: $1,8305 Year CAGR: 3.8%Haiti is a Caribbean country with a small and underdeveloped economy that is primarily based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Remittances from Haitian nationals living abroad are a significant contributor to the economy of Haiti. The 2010 earthquake absolutely devastated Haiti and the country hasn't recovered since. It is home to an extremely high percentage of crimes, with gangs basically ruling its capital. Haiti struggles with consistent and efficient energy generation and distribution, and the lack of access to affordable and reliable power hinders investment and business growth in the country. Most of the electricity in Haiti is generated using imported fossil fuels.46. SenegalTotal GDP (in billions): $27.6GDP Per Capita: $1,6375 Year CAGR: 5.6%Senegal is a West African country with a diversified economy. A low literacy rate and high unemployment rates have contributed to Senegal being among the poorest countries in the world.  Senegal has a trade agreement with the US. Under this trade agreement, Senegal exports processed foods, seafood, and cosmetics. Historically, France has been the main source of foreign direct investment in Senegal, but in recent years, China has also become a significant investor in the country.45. DjiboutiTotal GDP (in billions): $3.5GDP Per Capita: $3,1505 Year CAGR: 4.7%Djibouti is a small country in the Horn of Africa with a small and underdeveloped economy. Djibouti's land is quite arid which makes farming very difficult and with a lack of industrialization, there aren't many other opportunities for sustenance. Djibouti has a number of ports that are an important contributor to the economy, with the port of Doraleh being a major regional hub for trade.44. BhutanTotal GDP (in billions): $2.5GDP Per Capita: $3,2665 Year CAGR: 0.7%Bhutan is a small, landlocked country in South Asia with a small and underdeveloped economy. Bhutan's poverty is caused by the country not having many natural resources. Bhutan has a number of hydroelectric power plants that are an important contributor to the economy, with the country exporting a significant amount of electricity to India (see 20 countries that produce the most electricity).43. Timor-LesteTotal GDP (in billions): $3.6GDP Per Capita: $2,7415 Year CAGR: 17.8%Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) is a small, developing country in Southeast Asia with a small and underdeveloped economy. Timor-Leste has really uneven terrain, because of which farming and water-gathering are both quite difficult in a country where most of the people are dependent on agriculture. Timor-Leste has a number of oil and gas reserves that are an important contributor to the economy, with the country exporting a significant amount of oil and gas to other countries.42. NicaraguaTotal GDP (in billions): $14GDP Per Capita: $2,0465 Year CAGR: 0.3%Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western hemisphere and relies on the US for two thirds of its exports. Nicaragua is a significant exporter of coffee to the United States, with the country exporting a variety of coffee including specialty coffee, organic coffee, and fair trade coffee (see 12 countries that produce the best coffee). Nicaragua also exports a wide range of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables to the United States, including bananas, pineapples, avocados, and beans. Political instability, conflicts and inequality between urban and rural areas have all contributed to poverty in Nicaragua.41. MyanmarTotal GDP (in billions): $65.1GDP Per Capita: $1,2105 Year CAGR: 1.2%Myanmar (also known as Burma) is a country in Southeast Asia. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the world and the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims followed by a coup by one of the most brutal armies in the world means that there is very little likelihood that things will improve in the near future. Myanmar's main exports are petroleum gas, rice, textiles, and refined copper. China is Myanmar's main trading partner.40. EthiopiaTotal GDP (in billions): $111.3GDP Per Capita: $9255 Year CAGR: 6.4%Ethiopia is a landlocked country in East Africa with a large and underdeveloped economy. Ethiopia is one of the countries where colonization has been a major contributor to the place where it finds itself right now. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the economy of Ethiopia, with crops such as coffee, teff, and oilseeds being important exports.39. Cabo VerdeTotal GDP (in billions): $1.9GDP Per Capita: $3,2935 Year CAGR: 1.8%Cabo Verde (also known as Cape Verde) is a small, island nation in the Atlantic Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. Since 1990, Cabo Verde has experienced significant economic growth, largely due to the rapid expansion of tourism, which accounts for 25% of the country's GDP.

CambodiaTotal GDP (in billions): $27GDP Per Capita: $1,6255 Year CAGR: 4.0%Cambodia is a country in Southeast Asia. Cambodia's economy has grown at an average annual rate of 7.7% between 1998 and 2019, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

MauritaniaTotal GDP (in billions): $10GDP Per Capita: $2,1665 Year CAGR: 8.0%Mauritania is a predominantly desert country (75% of the country is the Sahara Desert), with very little arable land (only 0.5% of the total land area) and large areas of pastoral land. Mauritania has a number of natural resources, including iron ore, gypsum, and oil, and these resources are a significant contributor to the country's economy. Mauritania's especially hydrocarbon sector has potential for growth. U.S. energy company Kosmos Energy discovered a large deposit of natural gas off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal in 2014.36. MicronesiaTotal GDP (in billions): $0.4GDP Per Capita: $3,5715 Year CAGR: 2.0%Federated States of Micronesia is a country in the Pacific Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. The Federated States of Micronesia's economy is primarily based on subsistence agriculture and fishing. The country lacks valuable mineral deposits, with the exception of high-grade phosphate. Micronesia is one of several Pacific islands where the governments do not properly spend funds received in aid, thereby exacerbating poverty instead of eradicating it.35. TanzaniaTotal GDP (in billions): $67.8GDP Per Capita: $1,0995 Year CAGR: 4.9%Tanzania is a country in East Africa with a large and underdeveloped economy. Tanzania has failed to improve its agricultural productivity over the past few decades which is why it is still among the poorest countries in the world.

NepalTotal GDP (in billions): $36.3GDP Per Capita: $1,2085 Year CAGR: 4.6%Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia with a large and underdeveloped economy. Nepal's economic growth has been slower compared to many of its neighboring countries due to a history of political instability. Despite Nepal charging thousands of dollars to hundreds of climbers each year who want to climb Mount Everest, its location means that the development of infrastructure is more difficult while the country also needs to make more advances in agricultural technology.32. Solomon IslandsTotal GDP (in billions): $1.6GDP Per Capita: $2,3055 Year CAGR: 2.1%The Solomon Islands are a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy.

BeninTotal GDP (in billions): $17.1GDP Per Capita: $1,3195 Year CAGR: 6.2%Benin is a country located in West Africa, bordered by Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east, and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north. It is situated on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea and has an area of approximately 112,620 square kilometers. The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the largest city is Cotonou. Benin is a former French colony and is home to a diverse population with a rich cultural heritage. Around half of Benin's population is employed in the agriculture sector which is quite vulnerable. However, its GDP improvement shows that the country is on track to improve. In 2021, the economy of Benin experienced a strong recovery argely driven by the services and construction sectors, with an estimated growth rate of 7.2%.30. UgandaTotal GDP (in billions): $40.5GDP Per Capita: $8845 Year CAGR: 5.7%Uganda is a landlocked country located in East Africa, bordered by Kenya to the east, South Sudan to the north, the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west, and Rwanda and Tanzania to the south.

Uganda is home to a really complex land system which has resulted in uneven land distribution and unequal spread of resources. Uganda is a significant producer of coffee, with the country exporting a variety of coffee beans to countries around the world.29. ZambiaTotal GDP (in billions): $22.1GDP Per Capita: $1,1375 Year CAGR: -3.1%Zambia is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, bordered by Angola to the west, the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the south-east, Zimbabwe to the south, and Botswana to the south-west. The country has been mired in major external debt which is a significant reason behind its poverty. One of the main factors contributing to Zambia's debt problem is the country's reliance on borrowing to finance its development projects and infrastructure. This has led to a large increase in the country's external debt, which has put pressure on the government's ability to pay its debts and meet its financial obligations. In addition, the country has faced economic challenges, including a decline in the prices of its main exports and a slowdown in economic growth, which have made it more difficult for the government to repay its debts.28. Sao Tome and PrincipeTotal GDP (in billions): $0.5GDP Per Capita: $2,3615 Year CAGR: 7.0%São Tomé and Príncipe is a small island nation located in Central Africa, off the coast of Gabon.

The country has an area of approximately 1,001 square kilometers and is home to a population of around 200,000 people. The capital of São Tomé and Príncipe is São Tomé, which is also the largest city in the country. Sao Tome and Principe does not possess many assets or even means of production, which is why average income is quite low in the country. The country's main export is cocoa.27. GuineaTotal GDP (in billions): $16.1GDP Per Capita: $1,1895 Year CAGR: 9.3%Guinea is a country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Guinea-Bissau to the northwest, Senegal to the north, Mali to the northeast, Ivory Coast to the east, and Liberia and Sierra Leone to the south. The capital city of Guinea is Conakry. The country has a diverse economy, with significant contributions from the mining sector, agriculture, and the service sector.Guinea has significant reserves of minerals, including bauxite, iron ore, and gold, and the mining sector has been a major contributor to the country's economic growth. In recent years, the government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment, which have helped to drive economic growth.However, Guinea still faces a number of challenges, including limited infrastructure, political instability, and a lack of access to credit for many businesses. In addition, the country has a high poverty rate, with more than half of the population living below the poverty line. Improving the economic prospects of the country's poorest citizens will require further efforts to address these challenges.26. SudanTotal GDP (in billions): $34.3GDP Per Capita: $7525 Year CAGR: -23.3%Sudan is a country located in North Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. The capital city of Sudan is Khartoum. Sudan has the worst CAGR of any country in the world based on our calculations. In recent years, the country has faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation, a large trade deficit, and a shortage of foreign exchange.Following the ouster of former President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and the establishment of a transitional government, Sudan has been working to implement economic reforms and secure international support to help stabilize the economy. In 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility for Sudan, which aims to support the country's economic reform program and help it address its external imbalances.Sudan has also been working to improve relations with its neighbors and regional organizations, which could help to boost trade and investment and contribute to economic growth. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including ongoing conflicts and political instability, which could hinder its economic development.25. Burkina FasoTotal GDP (in billions): $19.7GDP Per Capita: $8935 Year CAGR: 6.9%Burkina Faso is a country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Niger to the east, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, Côte d'Ivoire to the southwest, Mali to the northwest, and Senegal and Mauritania to the west. The capital city of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou. Burkina Faso is a low-income, landlocked country with a largely agrarian economy. Agriculture accounts for a significant share of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs a large proportion of the labor force. Cotton, livestock, and gold are among the country's major exports. Burkina Faso also has some deposits of manganese, limestone, and marble.Over the past decade, Burkina Faso has experienced relatively strong economic growth, with an average annual GDP growth rate of nearly 7%. This growth has been driven in part by the country's mining sector and by favorable weather conditions that have supported agriculture. However, the country's economic growth has not been evenly distributed, and poverty remains a significant challenge, with more than half of the population living below the poverty line. A lack of rural productivity and a growing population means that the country has struggled to provide the majority of its population with sufficient resources.24. Democratic Republic of CongoTotal GDP (in billions): $55.4GDP Per Capita: $5775 Year CAGR: 7.8%The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has large deposits of gold, cobalt, and high-grade copper. Cobalt, a crucial component in the production of electric vehicles, gives the DRC a strategic advantage in the shift towards renewable energy. In 2020, the DRC was the leading global producer of cobalt, with a output of 95,000 tons, or about 41% of the world's total cobalt production. In 2021, nearly 64% of Congolese lived on less than $1.25 a day, which signifies how much the population is suffering. On the positive side, it has posted one of the highest CAGRs among any countries, and could be ripe for investment.23. Kyrgyz RepublicTotal GDP (in billions): $8.5GDP Per Capita: $1,2775 Year CAGR: 2.1%The Kyrgyz Republic, also known as Kyrgyzstan, is a country located in Central Asia. It is bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, China to the east, Tajikistan to the south, and Uzbekistan to the west. The capital city of Kyrgyzstan is Bishkek. Two-thirds of the population of Kyrgyz Republic live in rural areas and while the country is dependent on agriculture, many do not even have agricultural education which could help improve its income per capita. The country is heavily dependent on exports of minerals, particularly gold, and on remittances from Kyrgyz citizens working abroad. The country also has a significant agricultural sector, with livestock and grain being the main products. 22. MaliTotal GDP (in billions): $19.1GDP Per Capita: $8745 Year CAGR: 4.5%Mali is a country located in West Africa. It is bordered by Algeria to the north, Niger to the east, Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire to the south, Guinea to the southwest, and Senegal and Mauritania to the west. The capital city of Mali is Bamako. Mali needs to really work on improving its educational infrastructure which is extremely poor. The average daily wage in the country is $1.25 per day.

Cryptocurrency prices have plummeted from their former highs and mainstream interest in digital collectibles has waned, bringing down NFT prices.But the extended crypto winter has come with a potential silver lining – tax-loss harvesting, where NFT enthusiasts can sell their no longer valuable JPEGs and claim losses to offset their tax bill.Enter Unsellable, a platform launched last month that acquires “worthless” NFTs for the cost of gas plus a few bucks. The site functions as instant liquidity for otherwise, as the name suggests, unsellable NFTs, providing a quick way for NFT investors to capture their losses.“Think of us as Web3 junk removal,” it says on the website. At the time of writing, the service has so far purchased over 9,300 NFTs, according to Etherscan.The most valuable NFT in the Unsellable Collection on OpenSea so far is Army of the Dead #78, a skeleton-themed PFP that sold for over 3.6 wrapped ether (wETH) in January 2022. At the time of sale, when ETH was worth around $3,300, the NFT was valued at about $12,000. Today, as the price of ETH has fallen sharply, that same token is only worth $4,330.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The majority of NFTs purchased by the site are derivative projects – meaning, collections based on other popular projects that are often made worse. These include Lost Nouns, a derivative of Nouns, Anatomy Science Ape Club, a derivative of BAYC and Baby Goblinz, a play on Goblintown.The platform also allows users to sell their no-longer-wanted NFTs in bulk. One collector sold dozens of NFTs from the GoopGirls collection, along with others, in a single transaction, paying only 0.05 ETH (about $65) plus gas fees.The platform’s popularity comes as once-profitable traders seek to cut their losses. Prices for most NFTs and cryptocurrencies were at their dollar-value peak last December and January, with NFTs being hit especially hard. The boom in prices for NFTs also coincided with a peak in trading volume, meaning most NFTs purchased at the time were at prices higher than current values.Read more: How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto]"

(TSE:ESM) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Euro Sun Mining Inc. operates as a gold and copper exploration and development mining company in Romania. The CA$21m market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$11m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$8.4m, as it approaches breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Euro Sun Mining's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Euro Sun Mining According to some industry analysts covering Euro Sun Mining, breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of US$13m in 2025. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 3 years from now. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 68% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Euro Sun Mining given that this is a high-level summary, though, take into account that typically a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.One thing we would like to bring into light with Euro Sun Mining is it currently has negative equity on its balance sheet. Accounting methods used to deal with losses accumulated over time can cause this to occur. This is because liabilities are carried forward into the future until it cancels. Oftentimes, losses exist only on paper but other times, it can be a red flag.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Euro Sun Mining which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

Click to skip ahead and see Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: 5 Biggest Healthcare Stocks.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) are three of the healthcare companies that Jim Simons’ quant fund has identified as having bright future prospects.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is one of the biggest money managers in the world, with assets under management of more than $130 billion as of April 2021. The renowned quantitative fund is one of the most fascinating success stories in the history of finance, being founded and shaped by Simons and others with academic/mathematical backgrounds and zero stock trading experience.Jim Simons’ stock portfolio is guided by advanced mathematic, or quantitative, models, which sift through massive amounts of data to pinpoint obscure correlations that can then be profited from. And boy, has the fund ever profited from them.Renaissance’s flagship Medallion fund, which is named in honor of the math awards Simons has won, including the AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 1976, has been the most successful fund in history, returning an absurd 66% before fees on an annualized basis between 1988 and 2018 and generating more than $100 billion in trading profits. The fund also returned 76% in 2020 despite the dramatic market upheaval unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Medallion fund is currently closed to outside investors.Jim Simons’ stock portfolio has traditionally had large exposure to the healthcare sector, suggesting the fund’s mathematical models are more bullish on the long-term prospects for healthcare stocks than for any other industry. At the end of September, the fund had 18.5% exposure to healthcare stocks in its $70.7 billion 13F portfolio, trailing tech stocks by just five basis points in terms of overall exposure. The fund doesn’t have more than 10% 13F exposure to any other sector.Story continuesIn this article we’ll take a look at the ten healthcare stocks that Renaissance Technologies likes the most from an industry it’s been extremely bullish on for years.Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: 10 Biggest Healthcare StocksJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesOur MethodologyThe following data about Jim Simons’ stock portfolio is gathered from Renaissance Technologies’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: 10 Biggest Healthcare Stocks10. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $308 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 Jim Simons’ quant fund has at least $480 million invested in each of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), which rank among his top healthcare picks. The Jim Simons stock portfolio also has a significant $308 million position in Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), though it did cut the size of its holding by 26% during Q3 to 1.15 million shares.A lot is riding on the progress of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)’s Alzheimer’s treatments, namely Lecanemab, which has showed the ability to slow the progression of the disease. That’s in contrast to Biogen’s other Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm, which was significantly hyped in 2021 for its ability to reduce amyloid beta plague, which is considered a contributor to Alzheimer’s. However, that treatment nonetheless failed to demonstrate any improvement or slowing of Alzheimer symptoms in patients. The Alzheimer’s market is projected to be worth as much as $25 billion by 2029.ClearBridge Investments discussed the recent trial results of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)’s Lecanemab in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) was the leading contributor among several biopharma names, boosted by positive, pivotal clinical data for its next-generation Alzheimer’s treatment Lecanemab. In a pivotal trial, the drug proved safe and efficacious in slowing progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”9. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $318 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 44 Jim Simons made just a minor tweak to his fund’s AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) holding during Q3, trimming it by 2% to just under 5.8 million shares. AZN shares had a big Q4, gaining 24%, which lifted them to 16% gains for the year.One of the 5 Biggest European Pharmaceutical Companies, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) has a much more stable revenue base than Biogen and an equally promising pipeline of treatments, with no less than 18 phase 3 trials expected to produce results in 2023, the bulk of which are in oncology. Those are in addition to the company’s promising breast cancer treatment Enhertu, which demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy in a phase 3 trial.Carillon Tower noted that foreign currency headwinds, among other things, weighed on AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) shares in Q3, as discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)’s relatively high exposure to international end markets and foreign currencies in the face of rising global macroeconomic concerns drove stock underperformance. Increasing industry focus on over-the-counter drug litigation, where the company has modest exposure, also may have weighed on shares.”8. Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $323 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 Renaissance Technologies trimmed the size of its Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) position by 6% during Q3, with Jim Simons’ stock portfolio ending the quarter with nearly 4.85 million shares. Several hedge funds added INCY to their 13F portfolios during Q3 following a moderate sell off of the stock during the prior two quarters. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners built two of the largest new stakes in INCY during the third quarter.Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) is another biotech with a focus on oncology, including its treatment for bone marrow disorders, Jakafi, which comprise the bulk of the company’s sales right now. Back in 2019, the company predicted that Jakafi could hit $2.5 billion to $3 billion in sales by 2026 and those projections may end up being extremely modest.In Q3, Jakafi pulled in $620 million in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, while Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) as a whole had $713 million in sales. The company is guiding for as much as $2.4 billion in sales for Jakafi in its fiscal year 2022. The company also has some intriguing prospects in the dermatology space, including treatments for both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $328 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Jim Simons made a sizable investment in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) during Q3, raising the size of his stake in the company by more than 150% to over 1.01 million shares. Other hedge funds have also been buying up LLY in droves recently, as there’s been a 36% jump in the number of funds long LLY over the past two quarters.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also has a promising Alzheimer’s treatment in development called donanemab, which has shown greater efficacy than Biogen’s Aduhelm when it comes to clearing beta amyloid plague from the brain. However, it’s still early days for the trial and it will need to show improvement in slowing the progression of symptoms, which Aduhelm failed to demonstrate. That aside, Eli Lilly also has a robust pipeline of diabetes and other drugs, including future blockbuster Mounjaro.The ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy added Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and its promising portfolio of diabetes drugs to its 13F portfolio in Q3, as the fund revealed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $393 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 Closing out the first half of the ten biggest healthcare stock picks in Jim Simons’ stock portfolio is Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). The billionaire money manager cut his fund’s MRK stake by 33% during Q3, leaving it with over 4.56 million shares. Merck has had remarkably steady hedge fund ownership in recent years, with between 72 and 89 funds long MRK every quarter since Q4 of 2015.As one of the 5 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy Now, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is competing head-to-head with Eli Lilly for supremacy in the huge diabetes market, which is forecast to top $54 billion in revenue by 2030. The company has a blockbuster treatment of its own in the form of type 2 diabetes drug Januvia, which pulled in $5.3 billion in sales in 2021. However, the company loses patent exclusivity on the treatment in January 2023, though there are currently no generic versions of it available. Merck has plenty of possibilities in its pipeline to replace any waning Januvia sales, as it has 112 programs in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials as of August 2, 2022.Carillon Tower Advisers discussed the recent performance of its Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) investment in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported a strong first quarter and raised its financial guidance for 2022. The company also continues to benefit from the recent rotation into pharmaceuticals, which historically has been a more defensive industry.”See where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Molina Healthcare, Inc.

For example, during the recent holiday shopping season, sales climbed 7.6% year-over-year. And since most people don’t buy each other paper towels, eggs, and toothpaste for Christmas, I have to believe that discretionary products account for most of the increase. As a result, it’s clear that consumer spending isn’t going to fall off a cliff anytime soon. And the U.S. GDP rose by a healthy annualized rate of 3.2% in the third quarter. Given these points, I believe that a new bull market will begin in the first quarter of 2023, and I’m excited to unveil my blue-chip stock predictions for 2023.TickerCompanyPriceIBMIBM$140.92VVisa$206.44WFCWells Fargo$41.14VWAGYVolkswagen$15.36LNGCheniere Energy$151.35NOWServiceNow$377.49BKNGBooking Holdings$84.09IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

In fact, in the third quarter, the revenue of its software and consulting businesses jumped 14% year-over-year and 16% YOY, respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe strong results indicate that the company’s strategy of developing systems that suit the hybrid cloud –which combines the use of the public cloud, the edge cloud, and local databases — is resonating with its clients. And that’s logical because, as CEO Arvind Krishna explained in a recent interview, it makes perfect sense, in this era when hacking has become a major issue, and there is geopolitical upheaval, that companies and countries would want to store some of their more sensitive data locally. Additionally, the edge cloud is used to support artificial intelligence that’s utilized to replace workers, Krishna stated.Story continuesSpeaking of AI, IBM has emphasized the use of artificial intelligence, which is logical since the technology has become so powerful and useful at this point.Finally, according to IBM’s Senior VP of Sales, Rob Thomas, under Krishna’s leadership, IBM is focusing much more energy and resources on ensuring that its new customers are productively using IBM’s systems and understand how they can benefit by adopting more of its products. Since technology can be challenging to understand, integrate, and appreciate even for IT professionals, that strategy certainly seems worthwhile and profitable.With IBM’s common-sense strategies working and the Street having gained a greater appreciation for the firm, as shown by the outperformance of its shares, IBM belongs on one of my list of top blue-chip stock predictions for 2023.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comWithout a doubt, Visa (NYSE:V) and V stock will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of much better-than-expected consumer spending in 2023. After all, the vast majority of consumer spending is executed with credit cards these days. Moreover, Visa is America’s largest card network, and it earns a small portion of every transaction that is carried out with its cards.Visa should also get a lift from inflation since higher prices will boost its revenue, and if the company can keep its costs from rising less than inflation, its bottom line will also climb as a result of the phenomenon. Additionally, the card network should be helped by the resurgence of international travel since it earns higher fees when its cards are used for overseas spending.Also encouraging is the fact that the company’s U.S. payments volume jumped 9% year-over-year last month. And billionaire Ray Dalio, a veteran, highly renowned investor, more than doubled his stake in V stock last quarter to 1.2 million shares.Wells Fargo (WFC)A Wells Fargo (WFC) sign hangs on a brick building in Bloomfield, Connecticut.Source: Martina Badini / Shutterstock.comWith the American economy actually performing quite well even as it’s trashed daily in the media by Wall Street analysts, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), a very large bank that’s focused on lending to America’s businesses and consumers, is poised to outperform expectations in 2023.Perhaps that’s why WFC stock was identified on Dec. 4 as the 12th favorite stock of hedge funds and mutual funds by Goldman Sachs.Like all banks that are focused on lending, WFC’s net interest income will be boosted by higher interest rates.In an interview that took place on Dec. 6, CEO Charlie Scharf confirmed that prognosis, saying that “we certainly would expect next year’s net interest income to be higher than this year’s net interest income,”And although Scharf said that overall economic growth is slowing, he stated that the credit card spending of the bank’s customers continues to increase, although the business’s growth is slowing. Moreover, services and experiences businesses are doing quite well. And when it comes to loans, after the bank’s loans increased by 4% in the first three quarters of the year, the CEO reported that the direction of the company’s loan business had not changed meaningfully in Q4.So WFC is poised to benefit from continued credit card spending growth, higher net interest income, and continued strong loan growth. Yet the bank’s forward price-earnings ratio is a minuscule eight, creating a very good opportunity for investors in 2023.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comThe world’s second-largest automaker in global sales, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) trades at a tiny valuation, as it’s changing hands for just four times analysts’ average 2022 earnings per share estimate. That’s even below the low valuations of Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM), which change hands for about fives times analysts’ mean 2022 EPS estimates for them.Volkswagen’s valuation is being weighed down by the fact that its headquarters are in Europe. But the automaker obviously makes and sells vehicles all over the world. Moreover, as research firm Trefis pointed out recently, Volkswagen has a number of important strengths.Specifically, its deliveries jumped 10.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, while its operating profit soared 64% YOY. And the company’s electric-vehicle business is thriving, as its EV sales jumped 25% YOY to 366,400. With Volkswagen also building its own battery factories, the company should start emerging as an obvious winner in the EV race next year.According to Trefis, VWAGY stock is worth roughly $23 per share versus its closing price of $15.61 on Dec. 28.Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comContinuing our theme of blue-chip stocks with unjustifiably low valuations, let’s look at Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG). The company, which exports natural gas from the U.S., is changing hands for just 6.6 times analysts’ average 2022 earnings per share estimate for the company.Yet the company is generating huge profits, as it, as of November, is expected to generate $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion of “distributable cash flow” in 2022.And LNG has strong macro drivers. First, Europe is buying all of the natural gas it can get its hands on, as American LNG exports to the continent soared more than 200% year-over-year in the first nine months of 2022. Meanwhile, China’s reopening should rejuvenate the demand for natural gas from that country.Additionally, Cheniere is continuing to expand its export capacity by building more export facilities, and the company is benefiting from elevated liquid natural gas prices. And continued tensions between the West and Russia, along with the electrification of transportation, should keep natural gas prices high for the foreseeable future.ServiceNow (NOW)ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comNowadays, much of Wall Street seems allergic to buying or recommending Big Tech stocks. But ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), whose products automatically carry out IT tasks, appears to be an exception to that rule. Between the close of Dec. 7 and the close of Dec. 27, the shares were little changed. And Yahoo Finance earlier this month identified the name as a hedge-fund favorite.What’s more, Morgan Stanley recently identified NOW stock as its “top pick” in the software sector, saying that the company’s subscription model should enable its growth to remain resilient. Additionally, the bank, which has an “overweight” rating on the shares, expects NOW’s profit margins to climb in the coming months.Also noteworthy is that in Q3, institutional investors either held or bought 166 million shares of NOW stock, while only 12 million of its stock was sold by institutions. And showing institutions’ faith in the name, they own 87.7% of its shares.Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comAlong with Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Trip.com, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of three huge, U.S.-based online travel agencies, or OTAs.In a Dec. 6 interview, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf stated that U.S. consumers are continuing to spend a great deal of money on travel. Although I think that trend could slow somewhat next year, it should still remain strong for much of 2023, enabling Booking Holdings to continue reporting strong financial results and lifting BKNG stock.And in the third quarter, the number of hotel rooms rented through the site climbed about 8% versus Q3 of 2019, while the value of its gross bookings soared 27% versus the same period in 2019.Also encouragingly, billionaire George Soros, one of the world’s more successful investors, bought 10,000 shares of BKNG last quarter.Finally, the company should greatly benefit from the return of international travel.BKNG has a relatively low forward price-earnings ratio of 16.8 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for McCormick The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$731.2mUS$836.8mUS$886.0mUS$973.0mUS$1.02bUS$1.06bUS$1.10bUS$1.13bUS$1.16bUS$1.19bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.89%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.91%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$687US$739US$735US$758US$750US$732US$710US$687US$662US$637(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.1bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$82.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McCormick as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McCormickStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

However, it seems that the carrier is involved in a scandal that’s grabbing the headlines.Still, this probably won’t have a long-term negative impact on UAL stock. Indeed, the shares are worth a “B” rating because United Airlines offers an interesting clean-energy angle for prospective investors.United Airlines hasn’t had an easy 2022, to say the least. High fuel costs and recession fears didn’t make it easy for United to convince its shareholders to stay in the trade.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn the other hand, loyal investors don’t have to cut and run now. Whether you’re an alternative fuel aficionado or not, you can probably find reasons to stand by United Airlines in the coming year.UALUnited Airlines$37.29Bad but Not Devastating News for UAL Stock InvestorsNo need to beat around the bush – let’s address the unfortunate development that’s in the headlines. Apparently, Neil Swindells, leader of United Airlines pilots’ union, has resigned due to backlash over some of his online posts.Swindells was recently elected to that position, and he would have been a member of United Airlines’ board of directors if he hadn’t resigned. Allegedly, Swindells posted offensive comments on a message board frequented by pilots.Will this controversy be problematic for United Airlines? In the long term, the press will probably move on to other news items. Since Swindells resigned, United won’t need to fire him. Consequently, the impact on the airline’s bottom line will likely be minimal.Consider UAL Stock for Its Clean Energy AngleTo counter the unfortunate scandal, there’s potentially positive news concerning United Airlines. For example, the carrier plans to resume some discontinued flights from San Francisco International Airport to destinations in Osaka and Hong Kong (though, oddly enough, this wasn’t announced on United’s news page).Story continuesAlong with that, United Airlines’ investors should know that the company is venturing boldly into clean energy. Notably, United claims to be the first U.S. airline to invest in a biofuel refinery. In particular, United Airlines is investing in NEXT Renewable Fuels. According to the press release, NEXT is “permitting a flagship biofuel refinery in Port Westward, Oregon,” and that refinery is anticipated to commence production in 2026.Furthermore, United Airlines expressed its alternative energy endeavors by announcing an investment in Natron Energy. That company manufactures sodium-ion batteries which “have the potential to help United electrify its airport ground equipment like pushback tractors and operations at the gate.” Perhaps, by partnering with NEXT and Natron, United Airlines can become an alternative fuel leader in the U.S. aviation industry.What You Can Do NowYou might never have imagined that a conventional carrier could lead the way in decarbonization. Yet, United Airlines is taking concrete steps in that direction by partnering with ambitious clean energy businesses.Granted, some investors might be discouraged due to the news items concerning Swindells and his unfortunate online postings. Ultimately, whether you invest in UAL stock or not is entirely your decision. For now, though, it gets a “B” rating as United Airlines has the potential to lead the industry in supporting alternative fuel sources.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

(NYSE:V) insiders sold US$9.6m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-insiders-110009005.html,1672570809,STORY,['V'],"[In the last year, many Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Visa Visa Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Technology, Rajat Taneja, for US$5.4m worth of shares, at about US$217 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$208. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Visa insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Visa Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Visa. Specifically, insiders ditched US$9.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Visa Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$224m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Visa Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Visa shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Visa is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

For example, during the recent holiday shopping season, sales climbed 7.6% year-over-year. And since most people don’t buy each other paper towels, eggs, and toothpaste for Christmas, I have to believe that discretionary products account for most of the increase. As a result, it’s clear that consumer spending isn’t going to fall off a cliff anytime soon. And the U.S. GDP rose by a healthy annualized rate of 3.2% in the third quarter. Given these points, I believe that a new bull market will begin in the first quarter of 2023, and I’m excited to unveil my blue-chip stock predictions for 2023.TickerCompanyPriceIBMIBM$140.92VVisa$206.44WFCWells Fargo$41.14VWAGYVolkswagen$15.36LNGCheniere Energy$151.35NOWServiceNow$377.49BKNGBooking Holdings$84.09IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock had risen 6.4% this year, excluding its dividend payments, and, in line with my predictions, the tech giant’s cloud business thrived. In fact, in the third quarter, the revenue of its software and consulting businesses jumped 14% year-over-year and 16% YOY, respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe strong results indicate that the company’s strategy of developing systems that suit the hybrid cloud –which combines the use of the public cloud, the edge cloud, and local databases — is resonating with its clients. And that’s logical because, as CEO Arvind Krishna explained in a recent interview, it makes perfect sense, in this era when hacking has become a major issue, and there is geopolitical upheaval, that companies and countries would want to store some of their more sensitive data locally. Additionally, the edge cloud is used to support artificial intelligence that’s utilized to replace workers, Krishna stated.Story continuesSpeaking of AI, IBM has emphasized the use of artificial intelligence, which is logical since the technology has become so powerful and useful at this point.Finally, according to IBM’s Senior VP of Sales, Rob Thomas, under Krishna’s leadership, IBM is focusing much more energy and resources on ensuring that its new customers are productively using IBM’s systems and understand how they can benefit by adopting more of its products. Since technology can be challenging to understand, integrate, and appreciate even for IT professionals, that strategy certainly seems worthwhile and profitable.With IBM’s common-sense strategies working and the Street having gained a greater appreciation for the firm, as shown by the outperformance of its shares, IBM belongs on one of my list of top blue-chip stock predictions for 2023.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comWithout a doubt, Visa (NYSE:V) and V stock will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of much better-than-expected consumer spending in 2023. After all, the vast majority of consumer spending is executed with credit cards these days. Moreover, Visa is America’s largest card network, and it earns a small portion of every transaction that is carried out with its cards.Visa should also get a lift from inflation since higher prices will boost its revenue, and if the company can keep its costs from rising less than inflation, its bottom line will also climb as a result of the phenomenon. Additionally, the card network should be helped by the resurgence of international travel since it earns higher fees when its cards are used for overseas spending.Also encouraging is the fact that the company’s U.S. payments volume jumped 9% year-over-year last month. And billionaire Ray Dalio, a veteran, highly renowned investor, more than doubled his stake in V stock last quarter to 1.2 million shares.Wells Fargo (WFC)A Wells Fargo (WFC) sign hangs on a brick building in Bloomfield, Connecticut.Source: Martina Badini / Shutterstock.comWith the American economy actually performing quite well even as it’s trashed daily in the media by Wall Street analysts, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), a very large bank that’s focused on lending to America’s businesses and consumers, is poised to outperform expectations in 2023.Perhaps that’s why WFC stock was identified on Dec. 4 as the 12th favorite stock of hedge funds and mutual funds by Goldman Sachs.Like all banks that are focused on lending, WFC’s net interest income will be boosted by higher interest rates.In an interview that took place on Dec. 6, CEO Charlie Scharf confirmed that prognosis, saying that “we certainly would expect next year’s net interest income to be higher than this year’s net interest income,”And although Scharf said that overall economic growth is slowing, he stated that the credit card spending of the bank’s customers continues to increase, although the business’s growth is slowing. Moreover, services and experiences businesses are doing quite well. And when it comes to loans, after the bank’s loans increased by 4% in the first three quarters of the year, the CEO reported that the direction of the company’s loan business had not changed meaningfully in Q4.So WFC is poised to benefit from continued credit card spending growth, higher net interest income, and continued strong loan growth. Yet the bank’s forward price-earnings ratio is a minuscule eight, creating a very good opportunity for investors in 2023.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comThe world’s second-largest automaker in global sales, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) trades at a tiny valuation, as it’s changing hands for just four times analysts’ average 2022 earnings per share estimate. That’s even below the low valuations of Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM), which change hands for about fives times analysts’ mean 2022 EPS estimates for them.Volkswagen’s valuation is being weighed down by the fact that its headquarters are in Europe. But the automaker obviously makes and sells vehicles all over the world. Moreover, as research firm Trefis pointed out recently, Volkswagen has a number of important strengths.Specifically, its deliveries jumped 10.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, while its operating profit soared 64% YOY. And the company’s electric-vehicle business is thriving, as its EV sales jumped 25% YOY to 366,400. With Volkswagen also building its own battery factories, the company should start emerging as an obvious winner in the EV race next year.According to Trefis, VWAGY stock is worth roughly $23 per share versus its closing price of $15.61 on Dec. 28.Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comContinuing our theme of blue-chip stocks with unjustifiably low valuations, let’s look at Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG). The company, which exports natural gas from the U.S., is changing hands for just 6.6 times analysts’ average 2022 earnings per share estimate for the company.Yet the company is generating huge profits, as it, as of November, is expected to generate $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion of “distributable cash flow” in 2022.And LNG has strong macro drivers. First, Europe is buying all of the natural gas it can get its hands on, as American LNG exports to the continent soared more than 200% year-over-year in the first nine months of 2022. Meanwhile, China’s reopening should rejuvenate the demand for natural gas from that country.Additionally, Cheniere is continuing to expand its export capacity by building more export facilities, and the company is benefiting from elevated liquid natural gas prices. And continued tensions between the West and Russia, along with the electrification of transportation, should keep natural gas prices high for the foreseeable future.ServiceNow (NOW)ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comNowadays, much of Wall Street seems allergic to buying or recommending Big Tech stocks. But ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), whose products automatically carry out IT tasks, appears to be an exception to that rule. Between the close of Dec. 7 and the close of Dec. 27, the shares were little changed. And Yahoo Finance earlier this month identified the name as a hedge-fund favorite.What’s more, Morgan Stanley recently identified NOW stock as its “top pick” in the software sector, saying that the company’s subscription model should enable its growth to remain resilient. Additionally, the bank, which has an “overweight” rating on the shares, expects NOW’s profit margins to climb in the coming months.Also noteworthy is that in Q3, institutional investors either held or bought 166 million shares of NOW stock, while only 12 million of its stock was sold by institutions. And showing institutions’ faith in the name, they own 87.7% of its shares.Booking Holdings (BKNG)a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphoneSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comAlong with Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Trip.com, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of three huge, U.S.-based online travel agencies, or OTAs.In a Dec. 6 interview, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf stated that U.S. consumers are continuing to spend a great deal of money on travel. Although I think that trend could slow somewhat next year, it should still remain strong for much of 2023, enabling Booking Holdings to continue reporting strong financial results and lifting BKNG stock.And in the third quarter, the number of hotel rooms rented through the site climbed about 8% versus Q3 of 2019, while the value of its gross bookings soared 27% versus the same period in 2019.Also encouragingly, billionaire George Soros, one of the world’s more successful investors, bought 10,000 shares of BKNG last quarter.Finally, the company should greatly benefit from the return of international travel.BKNG has a relatively low forward price-earnings ratio of 16.8 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

60,74f9bfa5-2994-3af5-9cbb-fa7c27b59ea9,MAR,2023-01-01,50 Poorest Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/50-poorest-countries-world-183713344.html,1672511833,STORY,"['PL=F', 'HG=F', 'LC=F', 'GC=F', 'FC=F', 'NG=F', 'CC=F']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 50 poorest countries in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 poorest countries in the world.You might think that with the resources the world boasts right now, it is simply the proper usage of such resources which is why the success or failure of each country is based on its own performance and mistakes. Racists believe the truth to be even simpler; since most of the poorest countries in the world are located in Africa, these people believe that people who aren't white are simply inferior in every way, also pointing to most of the developed countries in the world having a population which is majority white.Of course, the truth is anything but the above. There are several major reasons which impact the success of a country. Before we talk about the present, let's first go to the past. European nations colonized most of the world centuries ago, with many countries only declaring independence in the last century. Let's consider India for example. According to a 2014 study, India was quite well off five centuries ago, before the British entered the country. While the British started trading in India much earlier, they became the dominant power in the country in 1757, after which it ruled the subcontinent for two centuries, in which wealth was plundered from India at a massive scale, while millions in the country were left destitute. Even though the British left India after dividing it into India and Pakistan in 1947, both countries still have a lot of catch up to do. While they may not be among the poorest countries in the world, and India's GDP may be competing with the biggest nations, poverty is still a huge issue with hundreds of millions living below the poverty line in the country due to inequality of resource distribution, with the country also being home to one of the wealthiest families in the world.50 poorest countries in the worldPixabay/Public DomainAnother study, conducted in 1996, researched the impact of colonization on Africa, where many countries were colonized by European powers. The study concluded that after considering everything, the impact of colonization on Africa's growth was overall negative, stating ""Finally, we show that variables capturing colonial heritage account for the different and negative performance of Africa relative to other continents are highly correlated with the Sub-Sahara dummy that other studies have used"".Story continuesWhile history and colonization have impacted the poorest countries in the world, there are other factors at play as well. According to another study conducted in 2019, stated that high-income countries realize the importance of research and development, and invest heavily in it, to come up with solutions to problems that exist right now. On the other hand, low income countries either do not give R&amp;D its due importance, or have too many other issues or too few resources to be able to properly allocate investments to R&amp;D. In 2019, global R&amp;D expenditure was $1.7 trillion and only 10 countries accounted for more than 80% of it, most of them being Western, developed nations. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage spend on R&amp;D meanwhile. While high income countries have outpaced poverty and infrastructure issues, low income countries are still impacted severely by these issues, not to mention malnutrition and food crisis, which takes up most of their resources. Low income countries also account for more than 85% of the global disease burden which again eats into the already meagre resources these countries have.Another reason that has affected the poorest countries in the world is industrialization. The first instance of industrialization, which transforms an economy from being agriculture dominated to becoming an industrial economy, took place in Western Europe and North America from the mid 18th to early 19th century. This gave these countries a massive advantage in being able to maximize income per person as opposed to other economies which were still mostly agrarian based, and hence, not as well-off. In the 20th century, countries in East Asia became industrialized as well, while Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa are currently in the process of undergoing industrialization. There are other issues as well that plague poorer countries including corruption and lack of implementation of laws, not to mention a lack of access to education, which is extremely important in enabling a country to break off its shackles and rising further.The above explanations show quite a gloomy picture of the poorest countries in the world, and make it seem almost impossible to get out of this situation. However, there are positive stories to focus on as well. When it gained independence in 1948, South Korea was home to a mostly agricultural based economy with low income and an impoverished population. However, from 1960 to 1996, the country underwent rapid growth which transformed it into an industrial society, which is home to some giants corporations including Samsung Group, KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) and POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX). One of the main reasons that the country has improved so much is because of its strong focus on high quality education which has been accessible to the vast majority of the population (see 25 most educated countries).Just like South Korea, there are many other nations which are working on improving their economies and developing strongly. This makes them prime for investment, but with additional risks. If you want a safe, steady investment, you can invest in Western Europe and North America, which are still growing but at low rates, and relatively free of any substantial risks. On the other hand, the poorest countries in the world generally have much higher growth rates as there is a lot more potential to grow substantially, with the risk that things might not pan out and even go in the other direction. When we discuss the list, we will mention the average 5 year growth rate of the country's GDP to display how ripe these nations could be for investment. We calculated the CAGR of each country's economy over the last five years, and five of the top 10 countries are from Africa, which is also home to several of the poorest countries in the world.To determine the poorest countries in the world, we have considered both their GDP and GDP per capita. There will be countries with higher GDP because of a bigger population but shouldn't be counted among the richest countries since their GDP per capita is quite low. This is why we've allocated 70% weightage to GDP per capita, with all data being taken from the World Bank. Most of these companies have a GDP which isn't even close to some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). So, without further ado, let's take a look at the countries which may not be doing so well right now, but could improve dramatically in the coming years and decades, starting with number 50:50. SamoaTotal GDP (in billions): $0.8GDP Per Capita: $3,8575 Year CAGR: -0.94%There are several Pacific islands in our list, including Samoa, which has struggled to fight poverty because of a vulnerability to natural disasters and rising unemployment. Tourism is an increasingly important sector of the economy in Samoa, with the country's beautiful beaches, cultural attractions, and friendly locals attracting visitors from around the world.49. ZimbabweTotal GDP (in billions): $28.4GDP Per Capita: $1,773.95 Year CAGR: 10.04%Zimbabwe is a country in southern Africa with a diverse economy that is driven by a number of different industries. One of the few countries with a CAGR of over 10%, Zimbabwe is still quite poor, with poverty increasing since the 1990s. Zimbabwe has a number of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, platinum, and chrome, and these resources are an important contributor to the economy.48. Republic of CongoTotal GDP (in billions): $13.4GDP Per Capita: $2,2905 Year CAGR: 3.8%The Republic of the Congo is a smaller country located on the Atlantic coast of central Africa. It is bordered by Gabon to the west, Cameroon to the northwest, the Central African Republic to the north, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the east. The capital city of the Republic of the Congo is Brazzaville. A low level of education and high unemployment has led to the Republic of Congo being among the poorest countries in the world.47. HaitiTotal GDP (in billions): $20.9GDP Per Capita: $1,8305 Year CAGR: 3.8%Haiti is a Caribbean country with a small and underdeveloped economy that is primarily based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Remittances from Haitian nationals living abroad are a significant contributor to the economy of Haiti. The 2010 earthquake absolutely devastated Haiti and the country hasn't recovered since. It is home to an extremely high percentage of crimes, with gangs basically ruling its capital. Haiti struggles with consistent and efficient energy generation and distribution, and the lack of access to affordable and reliable power hinders investment and business growth in the country. Most of the electricity in Haiti is generated using imported fossil fuels.46. SenegalTotal GDP (in billions): $27.6GDP Per Capita: $1,6375 Year CAGR: 5.6%Senegal is a West African country with a diversified economy. A low literacy rate and high unemployment rates have contributed to Senegal being among the poorest countries in the world.  Senegal has a trade agreement with the US. Under this trade agreement, Senegal exports processed foods, seafood, and cosmetics. Historically, France has been the main source of foreign direct investment in Senegal, but in recent years, China has also become a significant investor in the country.45. DjiboutiTotal GDP (in billions): $3.5GDP Per Capita: $3,1505 Year CAGR: 4.7%Djibouti is a small country in the Horn of Africa with a small and underdeveloped economy. Djibouti's land is quite arid which makes farming very difficult and with a lack of industrialization, there aren't many other opportunities for sustenance. Djibouti has a number of ports that are an important contributor to the economy, with the port of Doraleh being a major regional hub for trade.44. BhutanTotal GDP (in billions): $2.5GDP Per Capita: $3,2665 Year CAGR: 0.7%Bhutan is a small, landlocked country in South Asia with a small and underdeveloped economy. Bhutan's poverty is caused by the country not having many natural resources. Bhutan has a number of hydroelectric power plants that are an important contributor to the economy, with the country exporting a significant amount of electricity to India (see 20 countries that produce the most electricity).43. Timor-LesteTotal GDP (in billions): $3.6GDP Per Capita: $2,7415 Year CAGR: 17.8%Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) is a small, developing country in Southeast Asia with a small and underdeveloped economy. Timor-Leste has really uneven terrain, because of which farming and water-gathering are both quite difficult in a country where most of the people are dependent on agriculture. Timor-Leste has a number of oil and gas reserves that are an important contributor to the economy, with the country exporting a significant amount of oil and gas to other countries.42. NicaraguaTotal GDP (in billions): $14GDP Per Capita: $2,0465 Year CAGR: 0.3%Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western hemisphere and relies on the US for two thirds of its exports. Nicaragua is a significant exporter of coffee to the United States, with the country exporting a variety of coffee including specialty coffee, organic coffee, and fair trade coffee (see 12 countries that produce the best coffee). Nicaragua also exports a wide range of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables to the United States, including bananas, pineapples, avocados, and beans. Political instability, conflicts and inequality between urban and rural areas have all contributed to poverty in Nicaragua.41. MyanmarTotal GDP (in billions): $65.1GDP Per Capita: $1,2105 Year CAGR: 1.2%Myanmar (also known as Burma) is a country in Southeast Asia. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the world and the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims followed by a coup by one of the most brutal armies in the world means that there is very little likelihood that things will improve in the near future. Myanmar's main exports are petroleum gas, rice, textiles, and refined copper. China is Myanmar's main trading partner.40. EthiopiaTotal GDP (in billions): $111.3GDP Per Capita: $9255 Year CAGR: 6.4%Ethiopia is a landlocked country in East Africa with a large and underdeveloped economy. Ethiopia is one of the countries where colonization has been a major contributor to the place where it finds itself right now. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the economy of Ethiopia, with crops such as coffee, teff, and oilseeds being important exports.39. Cabo VerdeTotal GDP (in billions): $1.9GDP Per Capita: $3,2935 Year CAGR: 1.8%Cabo Verde (also known as Cape Verde) is a small, island nation in the Atlantic Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. Since 1990, Cabo Verde has experienced significant economic growth, largely due to the rapid expansion of tourism, which accounts for 25% of the country's GDP. Tourism is an increasingly important sector of the economy in Cabo Verde, with the country's stunning beaches, cultural attractions, and rich history attracting visitors from around the world.38. CambodiaTotal GDP (in billions): $27GDP Per Capita: $1,6255 Year CAGR: 4.0%Cambodia is a country in Southeast Asia. Cambodia's economy has grown at an average annual rate of 7.7% between 1998 and 2019, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. This growth has been driven by exports of garments and an increase in tourism. 18% of Cambodians live below the poverty line.37. MauritaniaTotal GDP (in billions): $10GDP Per Capita: $2,1665 Year CAGR: 8.0%Mauritania is a predominantly desert country (75% of the country is the Sahara Desert), with very little arable land (only 0.5% of the total land area) and large areas of pastoral land. Mauritania has a number of natural resources, including iron ore, gypsum, and oil, and these resources are a significant contributor to the country's economy. Mauritania's especially hydrocarbon sector has potential for growth. U.S. energy company Kosmos Energy discovered a large deposit of natural gas off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal in 2014.36. MicronesiaTotal GDP (in billions): $0.4GDP Per Capita: $3,5715 Year CAGR: 2.0%Federated States of Micronesia is a country in the Pacific Ocean with a small and underdeveloped economy. The Federated States of Micronesia's economy is primarily based on subsistence agriculture and fishing. The country lacks valuable mineral deposits, with the exception of high-grade phosphate. Micronesia is one of several Pacific islands where the governments do not properly spend funds received in aid, thereby exacerbating poverty instead of eradicating it.35.

Cryptocurrency prices have plummeted from their former highs and mainstream interest in digital collectibles has waned, bringing down NFT prices.But the extended crypto winter has come with a potential silver lining – tax-loss harvesting, where NFT enthusiasts can sell their no longer valuable JPEGs and claim losses to offset their tax bill.Enter Unsellable, a platform launched last month that acquires “worthless” NFTs for the cost of gas plus a few bucks. The site functions as instant liquidity for otherwise, as the name suggests, unsellable NFTs, providing a quick way for NFT investors to capture their losses.“Think of us as Web3 junk removal,” it says on the website. At the time of writing, the service has so far purchased over 9,300 NFTs, according to Etherscan.The most valuable NFT in the Unsellable Collection on OpenSea so far is Army of the Dead #78, a skeleton-themed PFP that sold for over 3.6 wrapped ether (wETH) in January 2022. At the time of sale, when ETH was worth around $3,300, the NFT was valued at about $12,000. Today, as the price of ETH has fallen sharply, that same token is only worth $4,330.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The majority of NFTs purchased by the site are derivative projects – meaning, collections based on other popular projects that are often made worse. These include Lost Nouns, a derivative of Nouns, Anatomy Science Ape Club, a derivative of BAYC and Baby Goblinz, a play on Goblintown.The platform also allows users to sell their no-longer-wanted NFTs in bulk. One collector sold dozens of NFTs from the GoopGirls collection, along with others, in a single transaction, paying only 0.05 ETH (about $65) plus gas fees.The platform’s popularity comes as once-profitable traders seek to cut their losses. Prices for most NFTs and cryptocurrencies were at their dollar-value peak last December and January, with NFTs being hit especially hard. The boom in prices for NFTs also coincided with a peak in trading volume, meaning most NFTs purchased at the time were at prices higher than current values.Read more: How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto]"

(TSE:ESM) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Euro Sun Mining Inc. operates as a gold and copper exploration and development mining company in Romania. The CA$21m market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$11m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$8.4m, as it approaches breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Euro Sun Mining's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Euro Sun Mining According to some industry analysts covering Euro Sun Mining, breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of US$13m in 2025. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 3 years from now. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 68% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Euro Sun Mining given that this is a high-level summary, though, take into account that typically a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.One thing we would like to bring into light with Euro Sun Mining is it currently has negative equity on its balance sheet. Accounting methods used to deal with losses accumulated over time can cause this to occur. This is because liabilities are carried forward into the future until it cancels. Oftentimes, losses exist only on paper but other times, it can be a red flag.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Euro Sun Mining which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Sean Major, for US$152k worth of shares, at about US$313 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$308. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). The only individual insider seller over the last year was Sean Major.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Air Products and Chemicals insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$227m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Air Products and Chemicals makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Click to skip ahead and see Citadel Stock Holdings: 5 Biggest Energy Stocks.FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) are three of the top Citadel stock holdings in the energy space among the fund’s non-options based holdings.Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is one of the 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM, with assets under management of more than $50 billion heading into 2023. The multi-strategy fund was in the midst of one of its best and most profitable years ever through November, with its flagship fund having gained 32% despite the market turmoil.With Citadel’s stock holdings performing so well, the fund planned to return $7 billion in profits to its clients early in 2023. The firm returned a total of $11 billion in profits to clients between 2017 and 2021. Citadel was already the second-most profitable hedge fund manager of all time as of 2021 according to LCH Investments, trailing only Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, which also got off a very strong start in 2022 but faltered in the second-half of the year.Citadel has its hands in all aspects of the financial arena, including credit, fixed income, macro, and commodities, which has helped it capitalize on various opportunities over the years. But Citadel’s stock holdings have been the multi-strategy fund’s bread and butter, having enjoyed a remarkable run of success dating back to just after the financial crisis, having gained at least 11% every year since suffering a devastating 54% loss during the crisis.Due to the fund’s heavy focus on options trading, its 13F portfolio value actually dwarfs its AUM in size, checking in at $439 billion at the end of September, up from $390 billion a quarter earlier. Given its gigantic portfolio, which contains tens of thousands of holdings, the Citadel’s exposure to various sectors changed very little quarter to quarter or even year to year.Story continuesCitadel has traditionally had more exposure to the finance, healthcare, tech, and consumer discretionary sectors than any other, while also having noteworthy holdings in energy, consumer staples, industrial, and communications stocks. In this article we’ll take a look at Citadel’s biggest stock holdings in the energy space as of September 30.Citadel Stock Holdings: 10 Biggest Energy StocksKen Griffin of Citadel Investment GroupOur MethodologyThe following Citadel stock holdings data is gathered from Citadel Investment Group’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. As we don’t typically cover options positions, we have scoured deep into Citadel’s portfolio to uncover the fund’s ten biggest non-options-based energy holdings.We follow hedge funds like Citadel Investment Group because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns. All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Citadel Stock Holdings: 10 Biggest Energy Stocks10. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $110 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45 Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) rank near the top of the list of Citadel stock holdings in terms of biggest energy stocks. Just grabbing a spot inside the top ten is First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR), which was one of the top performing stocks of 2022, gaining 69%. Citadel trimmed its long position in First Solar by 6% during Q3 to 831,771 shares and also has large positions of both put and call options on the stock.First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the 5 Best Solar Energy Stocks to Invest In Heading into 2023 as evidenced by the huge influx of smart money into the stock during Q3. There was a 73% jump in hedge fund ownership of the stock during the quarter, which included Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies and Zach Schreiber’s Point State Capital adding FSLR to their 13F portfolios.There has been a great deal of euphoria around solar stocks like First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) this year given the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to pour billions of dollars into climate change-focused initiatives. However, First Solar’s performance has been criticized by some analysts this year, as the company failed to generate positive free cash flow despite the most favorable pricing environment for solar modules in more than a decade.9. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $130 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is one of the top Citadel stock holdings, jumping into the top ten biggest energy holdings of Ken Griffin’s fund after it raised its stake in the company by 1,562% during Q3 to over 3.47 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of EXC took a big drop during Q1 and stayed flat during Q2, but rebounded during Q3, rising by 26%. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners owns by far the largest Exelon stake as of September 30, holding nearly 21.4 million shares.Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC), a utility services holding company with more than 10 million customers, is in the midst of implementing substantial improvements to its infrastructure in an effort to boost its reliability, investing $6.9 billion on the initiatives. The company projects to grow EPS by 6% to 8% over the next three years.While Exelon was hit with a wave of price target downgrades from analysts in November, they by and large remain bullish on the company’s operational performance, growth opportunities, and low-risk profile. The recent leadership turnovers, including the appointment of both a new COO and CFO, as well as adjustments for seasonality, influenced some of the downgrades.The ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is now being seen as a more premium player in the utilities space, as it discussed in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”8. Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $135 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27 Citadel now owns the biggest stake in Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED) among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database after raising its stake in the company by 290% during Q3 to 1.57 million shares. Former top shareholder AQR Capital raised its ED position by a modest 6% during the quarter to end September with 1.44 million shares.One of the 5 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED) is approaching the rarified air of Dividend King status, having raised its annual dividend payouts for 48 straight years. The company’s dividend history stretches back much farther than that, all the way to the 19th century in fact, as it’s been making payouts since 1885. Its shares currently yield 3.32%.Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED) recently announced that it will sell off its green energy business for $6.8 billion in a move that will allow it to pay down some of its debt and begin buying back more of its shares. It will also spare the company from having to invest in the growth initiatives for that business, which may have required it to take on more debt or issue more equity. The company instead plans to focus on investing in regulated utilities.7. Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $135 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 51 Citadel powered up its Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) position something fierce during Q3, raising it by 3,330% to over 22 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of SWN sank to an all-time low at the end of 2019 but has rebounded in a big way this year, nearly doubling during the first three quarters of 2022.Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) is one of the top natural gas producers in the U.S., with prime acreage at two of the most prominent shale gas basins in the country. Citi analyst Paul Diamond cited fundamental concerns with those basins in a recent report however, in which he downgraded SWN to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’ with a $6.50 price target.Those concerns appear to have been somewhat warranted as a record decline in supplies from the Appalachian Basin during the winter storm that swept much of the country in late December put tremendous strain on the power grid. Well freeze offs and mechanical issues were some of the reasons behind the 27% decline in production that was estimated by BloombergNEF.Greenlight Capital calculated Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN)’s PV-104 value at $13.83 per share in its Q1 2022 investor letter, more than double what shares currently trade hands for:“SWN is the second largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. The company is well-situated to satisfy growing domestic and export demand. Over the short, medium and long term, Europe now intends to reduce its reliance on Russian energy and increase its use of U.S. LNG. Based on its 2021 year-end reserves – which assumed a $3.60/MMBtu long-term natural gas price – SWN has a PV-104 value of $13.83 per share. By the end of the first quarter, the U.S. natural gas 5-year forward curve averaged $4.28/MMBtu, while international seaborne LNG was close to $20/MMBtu. Over the intermediate term, with the benefit of substantial global investment in infrastructure, we expect prices for U.S. and international natural gas to converge. We acquired our shares at an average price of $6.58. SWN shares ended the quarter at $7.17.”6. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)Value of Citadel Investment Group’s 13F Position: $147 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 46 Closing out the first half of the list of Citadel’s biggest energy stock holdings is Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), which the fund raised its stake in by 6% during Q3, lifting its share count to 6.99 million. Howard Marks’ Oaktree Capital has owned the largest stake in VST dating back to the second half of 2018, though its 13F exposure to the stock of 5.85% is about half what it was in 2018.Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) plans to fully capitalize on the Inflation Reduction Act, with the goal of eventually retiring its coal plants and investing heavily in solar and battery power in the coming years and decades. It is guiding to retire 8,000 MW of fossil-fuel powered plants by 2027, to be replaced in part by 1,213 MW of battery storage by 2026. Longer-term, the company aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.The Legacy Ridge Capital Partners Equity Fund believes Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s discount to intrinsic value is more attractive than ever, as it laid out in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We had a hard time deciding which company we should discuss in this letter. By just about every metric, all our holdings are cheap from both a relative and absolute perspective – especially compared to the performance of commodity prices and the recent pullback in the overall complex of energy stocks. For the first six months of 2022, oil was up 41%, natural gas up 45%, natural gas liquids up 34%, and the futures curve for electricity (in the two biggest deregulated power markets) is up ~30%, but our holdings were only up a measly ~1% by mid-year! The point is all our positions are investment stories worth telling.However, Vistra Corp stands out among the names we own. First, the market environment has improved materially over a multi-year basis, which will enhance VST’s ability to mint cash and at the same time underscores the longevity of VST’s asset base. Second, VST’s market value has remained flat, despite shrinking the share count by nearly 15% since adopting a transformational capital allocation strategy. The combination of those two factors results in ~50% more value in a VST share today than just six months ago.The bottom line is that the discount to intrinsic value of VST’s equity has become more attractive than ever. To better understand the two broader points, as well as our heightened conviction, it’s worth providing a brief history of the IPPs and summarizing the original VST investment thesis…” (Click here to see the full text)Click the link below to see where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), and FirstEnergy Corp.

70,d9a7de0b-acb7-37b5-b542-3bc6af64bc09,AKAM,2023-01-01,Returns On Capital At Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) Have Stalled,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-akamai-technologies-nasdaq-130950616.html,1672492190,STORY,['AKAM'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Akamai Technologies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$754m ÷ (US$8.1b - US$753m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Akamai Technologies has an ROCE of 10%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the IT industry. Check out our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Akamai Technologies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Akamai Technologies here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Akamai Technologies Tell Us?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 10% and the business has deployed 80% more capital into its operations. 10% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Akamai Technologies has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOur Take On Akamai Technologies' ROCEIn the end, Akamai Technologies has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. In light of this, the stock has only gained 28% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Akamai Technologies and understanding it should be part of your investment process.While Akamai Technologies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Is Colgate-Palmolive Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.83bUS$3.00bUS$3.21bUS$3.80bUS$3.97bUS$4.11bUS$4.23bUS$4.35bUS$4.46bUS$4.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.48%Est @ 3.03%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$104bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$56bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$83b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$78.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

72,150f8db5-4350-301c-9ef9-e8d9ab67559f,CMCSA,2023-01-01,Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 85% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-largely-120049931.html,1672574449,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Comcast, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Comcast already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Comcast's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Comcast. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.4%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Brian Roberts, the CEO has 0.8% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of ComcastWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Comcast Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.4b of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Comcast better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Comcast has   4 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Aon certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Aon peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Aon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Aon would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 223% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 126% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.4% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.2% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that Aon is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that Aon currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware Aon is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for McDonald's The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.44bUS$8.71bUS$8.87bUS$9.62bUS$10.1bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bUS$11.5bUS$11.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.87%Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.91%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$6.9kUS$7.5kUS$7.0kUS$7.0kUS$6.9kUS$6.6kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$65bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$196bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$196b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$90bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$155b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$264, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.099. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McDonald'sStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For McDonald's, we've put together three relevant factors you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with McDonald's , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does MCD's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) shareholders have seen the share price rise 49% over three years, well in excess of the market return (16%, not including dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).United Parcel Service was able to grow its EPS at 31% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that United Parcel Service has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of United Parcel Service, it has a TSR of 62% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that United Parcel Service shares lost 16% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 10% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - United Parcel Service has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Following the pandemic-driven lockdowns and lack of normal accessibility to salons, consumers globally have picked up new self care habits, including do-it-yourself (DIY) beauty regimes. Resultantly, DIY hair coloring is largely trending. The demand for natural, organic, cruelty free, and vegan hair care products is also on the rise as accountability increases in the beauty industry, in addition to celebrity endorsements and growing awareness. Manufacturers are enhancing their product lines by investing significantly in research and development to introduce organic/natural and clean-label ingredients in their hair care products, including shampoos and conditioners, organic hair oils, and hair masks etc. These products are expected to experience resilient growth over the forecast period of 2022 to 2027. Dandruff is a very common condition, which can lead to hair fall. Hair fall could also result from multiple factors, including genetics, hormonal imbalances, aging, and more. Approximately 70 million Americans experience hair loss. By the age of 35, two-thirds of males already lose some or all of their hair and it also impacts about 50% of women in the United States. Scalp psoriasis is another critical factor which can accelerate growth in the hair care market. The global hair care market was valued at $82.3 billion in 2022. IMARC Group expects the market to reach $107.2 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.4% during the forecast period of 2023 to 2028.To benefit from this growing industry, some of the best hair care stocks to invest in include The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the following hair care stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCY) is a French manufacturer and seller of cosmetic products for women and men worldwide. The company operates through four divisions – Consumer Products, L'oréal Luxe, Professional Products, and Active Cosmetics. It offers shampoos, hair care products, skin care products, hair colors, styling products, deodorants, sun care products, makeup, and perfumes. On October 20, L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCY) stock gained after the company reported strong Q3 sales, supported by solid demand for cosmetics and consumer products. The French beauty giant posted €27.94 billion in revenue, up from €23.19 billion in the prior year. On December 1, Citi analyst Cedric Besnard upgraded L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCY) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of EUR 365, up from EUR 355. The analyst said the stock's recent de-rating is enough to bring the focus onto the company's relative defensiveness as the backdrop in the sector deteriorates. The analyst noted that L'Oréal S.A.

(OTC:LRLCY) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Economies in Asia, meanwhile, are taking the opposite approach on stimulus, with China lowering its reserve requirement ratio for banks to support flagging growth in the world’s second largest economy. Japan’s new government passed a large stimulus bill after its economy contracted in the third quarter. Despite these actions, sentiment remains decidedly negative in these regions. We continue to see solid consumer demand in Asia, which has benefited our luxury and cosmetics holdings L’Oreal.”10. Natura &amp;Co Holding S.A.

We remained selective in the new issue market, participating in the IPO of Olaplex Holdings in the consumer staples sector. Olaplex is a marketer of hair care products targeting a massive consumer market where it is less than 1% penetrated. The company possesses a differentiated model driven by 1) a patented “bond building” ingredient, 2) a devout stylist community and social media presence that is larger than its mass channel peers, and 3) a fully outsourced model that borders on licensing.”7.

The Company’s healthcare and housewares businesses were major beneficiaries during the pandemic, and both we and the Company have been expecting a normalization of demand in this business. Further, the post-pandemic normalization of demand patterns at major customers such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon have further weighed on the Company – both in terms of fundamentals and in terms of market sentiment, plus stock valuation. Finally, decades-high inflation in key consumer staples categories such as food and other necessities has diverted some spending away from the more discretionary product categories supplied by Helen of Troy. Despite all these headwinds, the Company has been able to hold on to most of the business that it gained during the Pandemic. Revenues in the most recent quarter were +26% above the same quarter two years ago, and we find the stock’s valuation to be extremely attractive at the moment, at levels last seen in the 2008- 2009 recession period, when the Company was under former (and, in our opinion, inept) management.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:50 Poorest Countries in the World15 Companies That Are Buying Back Stock15 Most Advanced Countries in Europe Disclosure: None. 11 Best Hair Care Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Vertex Pharmaceuticals certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Growth Trending?Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 52% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 52% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 9.1% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.2% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.We've established that Vertex Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Having said that, be aware  Vertex Pharmaceuticals is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Vertex Pharmaceuticals, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

Click to skip ahead and see Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: 5 Biggest Healthcare Stocks.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) are three of the healthcare companies that Jim Simons’ quant fund has identified as having bright future prospects.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is one of the biggest money managers in the world, with assets under management of more than $130 billion as of April 2021. The renowned quantitative fund is one of the most fascinating success stories in the history of finance, being founded and shaped by Simons and others with academic/mathematical backgrounds and zero stock trading experience.Jim Simons’ stock portfolio is guided by advanced mathematic, or quantitative, models, which sift through massive amounts of data to pinpoint obscure correlations that can then be profited from. And boy, has the fund ever profited from them.Renaissance’s flagship Medallion fund, which is named in honor of the math awards Simons has won, including the AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 1976, has been the most successful fund in history, returning an absurd 66% before fees on an annualized basis between 1988 and 2018 and generating more than $100 billion in trading profits. The fund also returned 76% in 2020 despite the dramatic market upheaval unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Medallion fund is currently closed to outside investors.Jim Simons’ stock portfolio has traditionally had large exposure to the healthcare sector, suggesting the fund’s mathematical models are more bullish on the long-term prospects for healthcare stocks than for any other industry. At the end of September, the fund had 18.5% exposure to healthcare stocks in its $70.7 billion 13F portfolio, trailing tech stocks by just five basis points in terms of overall exposure. The fund doesn’t have more than 10% 13F exposure to any other sector.Story continuesIn this article we’ll take a look at the ten healthcare stocks that Renaissance Technologies likes the most from an industry it’s been extremely bullish on for years.Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: 10 Biggest Healthcare StocksJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesOur MethodologyThe following data about Jim Simons’ stock portfolio is gathered from Renaissance Technologies’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Jim Simons Stock Portfolio: 10 Biggest Healthcare Stocks10. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $308 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 Jim Simons’ quant fund has at least $480 million invested in each of Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), which rank among his top healthcare picks. The Jim Simons stock portfolio also has a significant $308 million position in Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), though it did cut the size of its holding by 26% during Q3 to 1.15 million shares.A lot is riding on the progress of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)’s Alzheimer’s treatments, namely Lecanemab, which has showed the ability to slow the progression of the disease. That’s in contrast to Biogen’s other Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm, which was significantly hyped in 2021 for its ability to reduce amyloid beta plague, which is considered a contributor to Alzheimer’s. However, that treatment nonetheless failed to demonstrate any improvement or slowing of Alzheimer symptoms in patients. The Alzheimer’s market is projected to be worth as much as $25 billion by 2029.ClearBridge Investments discussed the recent trial results of Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)’s Lecanemab in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) was the leading contributor among several biopharma names, boosted by positive, pivotal clinical data for its next-generation Alzheimer’s treatment Lecanemab. In a pivotal trial, the drug proved safe and efficacious in slowing progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”9. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $318 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 44 Jim Simons made just a minor tweak to his fund’s AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) holding during Q3, trimming it by 2% to just under 5.8 million shares. AZN shares had a big Q4, gaining 24%, which lifted them to 16% gains for the year.One of the 5 Biggest European Pharmaceutical Companies, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) has a much more stable revenue base than Biogen and an equally promising pipeline of treatments, with no less than 18 phase 3 trials expected to produce results in 2023, the bulk of which are in oncology. Those are in addition to the company’s promising breast cancer treatment Enhertu, which demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy in a phase 3 trial.Carillon Tower noted that foreign currency headwinds, among other things, weighed on AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) shares in Q3, as discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)’s relatively high exposure to international end markets and foreign currencies in the face of rising global macroeconomic concerns drove stock underperformance. Increasing industry focus on over-the-counter drug litigation, where the company has modest exposure, also may have weighed on shares.”8. Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $323 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 Renaissance Technologies trimmed the size of its Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) position by 6% during Q3, with Jim Simons’ stock portfolio ending the quarter with nearly 4.85 million shares. Several hedge funds added INCY to their 13F portfolios during Q3 following a moderate sell off of the stock during the prior two quarters. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners built two of the largest new stakes in INCY during the third quarter.Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) is another biotech with a focus on oncology, including its treatment for bone marrow disorders, Jakafi, which comprise the bulk of the company’s sales right now. Back in 2019, the company predicted that Jakafi could hit $2.5 billion to $3 billion in sales by 2026 and those projections may end up being extremely modest.In Q3, Jakafi pulled in $620 million in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, while Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) as a whole had $713 million in sales. The company is guiding for as much as $2.4 billion in sales for Jakafi in its fiscal year 2022. The company also has some intriguing prospects in the dermatology space, including treatments for both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.7. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $328 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Jim Simons made a sizable investment in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) during Q3, raising the size of his stake in the company by more than 150% to over 1.01 million shares. Other hedge funds have also been buying up LLY in droves recently, as there’s been a 36% jump in the number of funds long LLY over the past two quarters.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also has a promising Alzheimer’s treatment in development called donanemab, which has shown greater efficacy than Biogen’s Aduhelm when it comes to clearing beta amyloid plague from the brain. However, it’s still early days for the trial and it will need to show improvement in slowing the progression of symptoms, which Aduhelm failed to demonstrate. That aside, Eli Lilly also has a robust pipeline of diabetes and other drugs, including future blockbuster Mounjaro.The ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy added Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and its promising portfolio of diabetes drugs to its 13F portfolio in Q3, as the fund revealed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In the U.S., we initiated a position in pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) as it brings out new drug candidates for diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”6. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Position: $393 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 Closing out the first half of the ten biggest healthcare stock picks in Jim Simons’ stock portfolio is Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). The billionaire money manager cut his fund’s MRK stake by 33% during Q3, leaving it with over 4.56 million shares. Merck has had remarkably steady hedge fund ownership in recent years, with between 72 and 89 funds long MRK every quarter since Q4 of 2015.As one of the 5 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy Now, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is competing head-to-head with Eli Lilly for supremacy in the huge diabetes market, which is forecast to top $54 billion in revenue by 2030. The company has a blockbuster treatment of its own in the form of type 2 diabetes drug Januvia, which pulled in $5.3 billion in sales in 2021. However, the company loses patent exclusivity on the treatment in January 2023, though there are currently no generic versions of it available. Merck has plenty of possibilities in its pipeline to replace any waning Januvia sales, as it has 112 programs in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials as of August 2, 2022.Carillon Tower Advisers discussed the recent performance of its Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) investment in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported a strong first quarter and raised its financial guidance for 2022. The company also continues to benefit from the recent rotation into pharmaceuticals, which historically has been a more defensive industry.”See where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Molina Healthcare, Inc.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Waste Management with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Waste Management Waste Management's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Waste Management managed to grow EPS by 9.8% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Waste Management achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 12% to US$19b.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$109m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Waste Management but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesShould You Add Waste Management To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Waste Management is that it is growing profits.

86,b13a21b5-2224-3452-b54c-16e114d7f711,INTU,2023-01-01,The 7 Biggest Opportunities for Stock Investors in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-biggest-opportunities-stock-investors-210744361.html,1672261664,STORY,"['NFLX', 'WHR', 'ADBE', 'INTU', 'VVV', 'VALE']","[With global recession fears rising, this dynamic opens the door for the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. Essentially, the pessimism of the moment convinced many stakeholders (arguably for good reason) to abandon the ship. And we’re not just talking about technology-oriented names, though they bear the brunt of the damage. Rather, the pain cuts across several market segments.Further, until the Federal Reserve decides the coast is clear regarding monetary policy normalization, the red ink may continue flashing. For instance, Bloomberg noted that the Fed’s hawkish approach to tightening the money supply added to the debt pressure of developing nations. In addition, advanced economies that suffered sharp inflation mimicked the Fed, leading to global slowdown risks. Naturally, the equities sector felt the pain. But again, contrarians enjoy the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. Below are seven compelling examples.INTUIntuit$375.48ADBEAdobe$328.25WHRWhirlpool$138.89VVVValvoline$32.61VALEVale$16.94NFLXNetflix$276.96SESea Ltd.$48.31InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntuit (INTU)Source: ShutterstockOn the surface level, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) doesn’t immediately trigger sentiments regarding the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. The company specializes in tax and accounting software – boring. As well, only the bears have had any fun with INTU throughout 2022. On a year-to-date basis, shares plunged more than 33% in equity value.Still, it’s useful to look at Intuit fourth dimensionally, as Doc Brown might tell Marty McFly. According to Resume Builder, “90% of companies will require employees to return to office in 2023.” Almost guaranteed, this directive will not be popular with worker bees. However, the website also notes that “21% of companies will fire workers who do not return to the office.”So, it’s gig economy or bust – and that makes INTU one of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. Essentially, gig workers (i.e. independent contractors) face similar tax profiles to corporations; essentially, they’re in business for themselves. And such taxes are pound for pound much more complicated than the typical W2 forms employees fill out. Thus, Intuit should gain relevance next year (and the years afterward).Story continuesAdobe (ADBE)ADBE stock adobe stockSource: ShutterstockAnother example of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023 that doesn’t appear as such, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) presents risks. For one thing, the chart performance pings poorly. Since the start of the year, ADBE gave up nearly 41% of its equity value. Also, the company attracted some analyst downgrades over the trailing year.Fundamentally, though, Adobe garners relevance because of the gig economy. One of the few sectors that don’t offer a stereotypical image of its participants, gig workers cut a wide figure. From ride-sharing drivers to repair people to white-collar workers that don’t want the strict nine-to-five schedule, the gig economy welcomes all. And it certainly welcomes the creatives, which then bolsters demand for Adobe Photoshop and similar software.To be fair, hedge funds have been steadily mitigating their exposure to ADBE since the third quarter of 2020. At the same time, analysts still maintain a positive outlook for Adobe, rating it a consensus moderate buy. Given the changes in the workplace, the company is worth considering for contrarians seeking the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023.Whirlpool (WHR)a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and moreSource: shutterstock.com/Digital GeneticsI’m not going to pull any punches here. Admittedly, appliance manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) cuts an odd profile for the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. Further, its technical performance doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. Since the beginning of the year, WHR gave up 39% of its equity value. Besides, who invests in boring segments like common household appliances?Well, Whirlpool represents another example of investors requiring fourth-dimensional thinking. I laid out a detailed explanation on TipRanks. However, the gist of the argument goes like this. Whirlpool engineered its appliances to be durable for a specified time range under normal usage. However, with millions of white-collar workers operating remotely for about two years, the usage of household appliances significantly accelerated.This isn’t to say that all appliances will fail next year. However, if a household product were to fail in 2025, it’s quite possible that increased usage will push up the failure date to 2023. Therefore, WHR could see a demand uptick soon, making it one of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023.Valvoline (VVV)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWriting these types of gallery slides enables me to bring some potentially underappreciated gems to the table. For those seeking the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023, Valvoline (NYSE:VVV) could be an intriguing idea. As a manufacturer and distributor of its namesake branded automotive oil, additives, and lubricants, Valvoline depends on combustion-powered mobility. Obviously, that’s been a challenge for much of the post-pandemic new normal.However, as mentioned earlier, workplace normalization trends may shift the framework favorably for VVV stock. While on average, vehicle miles traveled recovered to pre-pandemic norms, the figure should be higher than where it stands now. A new generation of employees will enter the labor market. As well, with companies set to recall their workers, people must fire up their engines for the daily grind lest they suffer the consequences of insubordination.Irrespective of vehicular miles, many households will be looking to make their (combustion) cars last longer. This too benefits Valvoline, making it one of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023.Vale (VALE)An image of the nickel entry from the periodic table of the elements.Source: TonelloPhotography / Shutterstock.comNo matter how much gearheads may sing the praises of combustion-powered mobility, at some point, it’s quite possible that electric vehicles may take over. It may not happen by 2030, which certain policymakers hold as a benchmark. Still, the momentum in electrification shows no sign of abating. Nevertheless, figuring out which EV brand will win out, in the long run, presents difficulties. Therefore, investors should cut the ambiguities and consider Vale (NYSE:VALE).A Brazilian metals and mining specialist, Vale represents the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world. In particular, the latter commodity commands much relevance due to its high energy density. As well, nickel offers greater storage capacity at lower costs. Naturally, then, EV manufacturers saw the benefit of utilizing metal as a key component in battery packs.In other words, Vale ranks among the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023 because it’s a ticket seller. Sure, you can try to wager on which team will win the competition. But with so many rivals in the space, that’s an arduous task. Arguably, Vale provides a more surefire approach.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockMoving onto the high-risk, high-reward segment of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) generates both intrigue and trepidation. From a bird’s eye view, Netflix still commands extraordinary relevance because of its content-streaming business. On the other hand, this year’s been rough for NFLX. Since the January opener, shares hemorrhaged over 52% of equity value.Still, those that deploy a contrarian mindset enjoy justification for their optimism in Netflix. For one thing, the back half of 2022 presented food for thought. In the trailing six months, shares gained a whopping 58%. Fundamentally, the enterprise stands to benefit from the cheap entertainment thesis. After all, Hollywood really came to life because it provided a psychological pick-me-up for Americans during the Great Depression.If we do incur a recession, the same narrative may undergird NFLX. While technologies change, human instincts generally do not. Plus, for all the turmoil that Netflix suffered, analysts still like the stock. Per TipRanks, Wall Street experts rate it a consensus moderate buy.Sea Ltd.

I still believe this, given the underlying Southeast Asian market’s potential. Nevertheless, the pain has been awful. Critically, SE is down 77.5% YTD. And the back half performance stinks, with a trailing-six-month loss of 30%.However, when it comes to the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023, it’s hard to overlook the potential of developing regions.

Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve imposed significant challenges on risk-on enterprises. By raising the benchmark interest rate to combat historically high inflation, the central bank also invariably increased borrowing costs. Naturally, this disincentivized expansionary endeavors.In addition, geopolitical flashpoints combined with struggles associated with the global supply chain crisis hurt innovation. Not surprisingly, the dour ecosystem led to many enterprises announcing layoffs. Unfortunately, such actions stymie the synergies necessary for upside success. Nevertheless, with so much negativity baked in, intrepid investors can use the red ink to target the top tech stock predictions for 2023.MSFTMicrosoft$238.22GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$87.42INTUIntuit$383.13METAMeta Platforms$117.37PYPLPayPal$68.76ZIPZipRecruiter$15.70IMAXIMAX Corp.$14.18InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAmid the wild rumblings in the equities space, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) arguably provides the easiest case for top tech stock predictions for 2023. That’s because investors can reasonably bank on the relevant software (and hardware) giant. With MSFT shares down nearly 29% on a year-to-date basis, it’s an opportunity that market participants shouldn’t ignore.Fundamentally, Microsoft really does it all within the broader business ecosystem. First, the company’s Windows brand dominates the desktop operating system industry with 75.11% market share. In other words, if you want to succeed in business, you must be fluent in Microsoft.Second, the company rapidly moved into the workplace communications subsegment. Therefore, if work-from-home protocols remain permanent, Microsoft enjoys relevance. If not, the company’s other product categories can step up to the plate. To be sure, one doesn’t need a standalone workplace communications investment anymore. Plus, hedge funds – or the smart money – really love MSFT, expanding their position since the first quarter of 2022. With that, Microsoft ranks among the best tech stock predictions for 2023.Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOnce one of the high-flying names among the biggest innovators, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finds itself in unfamiliar territory. Since the beginning of this year, GOOG (Class C) shares dropped 38% in equity value. Still, a case exists for the underlying enterprise to be one of the top tech stock predictions for 2023.Fundamentally, it comes down to an old argument: Alphabet’s Google ecosystem owns the internet. As I write these words, Google owns 92.21% market share of the internet search engine sector. For all the competition that the Chinese (and the Russians to a lesser extent) throw at Google, they’ve utterly failed.Moving forward, search engine demand will likely skyrocket. With enterprises of all sizes issuing layoff announcements, people will need to look for either employment or independent income opportunities. Cynically, this framework bolsters GOOG. As well, according to TipRanks, Alphabet enjoys a strong buy consensus rating. Among nine covering analysts, all of them rate GOOG a buy. That’s quite an endorsement, making it one of the best tech stock predictions for 2023.Intuit (INTU)Source: ShutterstockIf tax and accounting software specialist Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) isn’t among the top tech stock predictions for 2023, wait till 2024. Right now, plenty of folks don’t believe in INTU. Since the start of the year, shares gave up 39% of equity value. Fundamentally, most worker bees are just that, worker bees reporting to a corporation. However, the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic may shift this tax profile.According to Resume Builder, “90% of companies will require employees to return to office in 2023.” It’s no stretch to say that a vast majority of employees won’t like that. Therefore, we could see an influx of participation in the gig economy. However, as I’ve mentioned many times before, tax filings for independent contractors (i.e. gig workers) are more complicated than the W2 forms that employees fill out. Therefore, those that never needed help with their taxes might pay for it in 2023 (or 2024). While INTU may not be on everyone’s radar, it deserves consideration.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, presenting Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as one of the tech stock predictions for 2023 carries many risks. At the time of writing, META shares tumbled slightly over 65% YTD. A significant portion of the volatility centers on declines in digital advertising revenue. As well, Meta insists on investing in its metaverse ecosystem, a matter which attracted heavy institutional criticism.Still, in the trailing month, META gained 8.5% of market value. It’s not going to reverse anything anytime soon. However, management demonstrated an ability to recognize harsh realities. In September, the company announced both a hiring freeze and a headcount reduction. Later on, it ended up laying off over 11,000 employees in November.Frankly, Meta just needs to go the extra step and reconsider some of its pricy investments in the metaverse. Heck, I wouldn’t necessarily be opposed to abandoning that ship altogether. The company still owns the massive Facebook network, which is really what management should concentrate on. Do that and META could be one of the top tech stock predictions for 2023.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersTo be quite clear, digital payments specialist PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) represents a major risk among upside tech stock predictions for 2023. Since the January opener, PYPL dropped almost 65% of equity value, an alarming statistic. However, it may be in the early stages of a possible recovery. During the trailing six months, PYPL “only” lost 9%. Moving forward, it can be a possible surprise for the new year.Fundamentally, PayPal benefits from the burgeoning gig economy. According to Industry Research, this ecosystem of independent contractors generated a valuation of $355 billion in 2021. By 2027, experts project that this sector will expand to hit $873 billion. That equates to a compound annual growth rate of 16.18%.Better yet, PYPL enjoys robust support among analysts and institutional players alike. Currently, TipRanks notes that PayPal features a strong buy consensus rating. Among 28 covering analysts, 21 assess PYPL as a buy and only seven as a hold. And since Q4 2021, hedge funds have dramatically increased their exposure to PYPL.ZipRecruiter (ZIP)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockTo hedge one’s bet on the potential narrative undergirding PayPal, investors may want to consider ZipRecruiter (NYSE:ZIP) as one of the top tech stock predictions for 2023. An employment marketplace for job seekers and employers, ZIP may see booming demand next year due to mass layoffs this year.While I frequently sing the praises of the gig economy, both investors and budding participants must appreciate survivorship bias. Sure, business media outlets like CNBC love broadcasting stories about how some gig workers make $300,000 a year. They’re in the minority. If such a circumstance were common, the gig economy would be roughly the GDP of China (based on 55 million U.S. gig workers making that amount).So, even if the gig economy expands significantly – which I believe will be the case – most folks will probably take comfort in standard employment. Therefore, ZIP makes for a cynically intriguing case for top tech stock predictions for 2023.IMAX (IMAX)the exterior of an Imax theaterSource: imageAllan / Shutterstock.comEasily the oddest name among tech stock predictions for 2023, advanced film projection specialist IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) appears unnecessarily risky. For one thing, there’s the matter of market underperformance. Since the start of the year, IMAX stock dropped 26% in equity value. As well, hedge funds have been gradually reducing their exposure to shares since Q4 2021.Of course, the main issue centers on the disappointments stemming from Avatar: The Way of Water. In its debut weekend at the domestic box office, the Avatar sequel rang up $134 million, slipping below expectations. Internationally, the film posted $301 million in sales. However, China’s tally of $57.1 million fell below expectations of $100 million.Still, the Chinese are gradually recovering from the Covid-19 crisis so the bearish assessment isn’t entirely fair. Also, the Hollywood industry now recognizes that it must concentrate on big blockbusters to succeed post-pandemic. And big blockbusters represent Imax’s bread and butter. Therefore, some patience could go a long way with the IMAX stock.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Essentially, the pessimism of the moment convinced many stakeholders (arguably for good reason) to abandon the ship. And we’re not just talking about technology-oriented names, though they bear the brunt of the damage. Rather, the pain cuts across several market segments.Further, until the Federal Reserve decides the coast is clear regarding monetary policy normalization, the red ink may continue flashing. For instance, Bloomberg noted that the Fed’s hawkish approach to tightening the money supply added to the debt pressure of developing nations. In addition, advanced economies that suffered sharp inflation mimicked the Fed, leading to global slowdown risks. Naturally, the equities sector felt the pain. But again, contrarians enjoy the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. Below are seven compelling examples.INTUIntuit$375.48ADBEAdobe$328.25WHRWhirlpool$138.89VVVValvoline$32.61VALEVale$16.94NFLXNetflix$276.96SESea Ltd.$48.31InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntuit (INTU)Source: ShutterstockOn the surface level, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) doesn’t immediately trigger sentiments regarding the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. The company specializes in tax and accounting software – boring. As well, only the bears have had any fun with INTU throughout 2022. On a year-to-date basis, shares plunged more than 33% in equity value.Still, it’s useful to look at Intuit fourth dimensionally, as Doc Brown might tell Marty McFly. According to Resume Builder, “90% of companies will require employees to return to office in 2023.” Almost guaranteed, this directive will not be popular with worker bees. However, the website also notes that “21% of companies will fire workers who do not return to the office.”So, it’s gig economy or bust – and that makes INTU one of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023. Essentially, gig workers (i.e. independent contractors) face similar tax profiles to corporations; essentially, they’re in business for themselves. And such taxes are pound for pound much more complicated than the typical W2 forms employees fill out. Thus, Intuit should gain relevance next year (and the years afterward).Story continuesAdobe (ADBE)ADBE stock adobe stockSource: ShutterstockAnother example of the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023 that doesn’t appear as such, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) presents risks. For one thing, the chart performance pings poorly. Since the start of the year, ADBE gave up nearly 41% of its equity value. Also, the company attracted some analyst downgrades over the trailing year.Fundamentally, though, Adobe garners relevance because of the gig economy. One of the few sectors that don’t offer a stereotypical image of its participants, gig workers cut a wide figure. From ride-sharing drivers to repair people to white-collar workers that don’t want the strict nine-to-five schedule, the gig economy welcomes all. And it certainly welcomes the creatives, which then bolsters demand for Adobe Photoshop and similar software.To be fair, hedge funds have been steadily mitigating their exposure to ADBE since the third quarter of 2020. At the same time, analysts still maintain a positive outlook for Adobe, rating it a consensus moderate buy. Given the changes in the workplace, the company is worth considering for contrarians seeking the biggest opportunities for stock investors in 2023.Whirlpool (WHR)a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and moreSource: shutterstock.com/Digital GeneticsI’m not going to pull any punches here.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at General Electric’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for General Electric What Is General Electric Worth?Good news, investors! General Electric is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $137.41, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that General Electric’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will General Electric generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With revenues expected to grow by a double-digit 21% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for General Electric. If the level of expenses is able to be maintained, it looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GE is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GE for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GE. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for General Electric from their most recent forecasts.

(NASDAQ:ADP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Automatic Data Processing, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Automatic Data Processing?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Automatic Data Processing does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Automatic Data Processing, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Automatic Data Processing is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Automatic Data ProcessingWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$121m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Automatic Data Processing. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Following the pandemic-driven lockdowns and lack of normal accessibility to salons, consumers globally have picked up new self care habits, including do-it-yourself (DIY) beauty regimes. Resultantly, DIY hair coloring is largely trending. The demand for natural, organic, cruelty free, and vegan hair care products is also on the rise as accountability increases in the beauty industry, in addition to celebrity endorsements and growing awareness. Manufacturers are enhancing their product lines by investing significantly in research and development to introduce organic/natural and clean-label ingredients in their hair care products, including shampoos and conditioners, organic hair oils, and hair masks etc. These products are expected to experience resilient growth over the forecast period of 2022 to 2027. Dandruff is a very common condition, which can lead to hair fall. Hair fall could also result from multiple factors, including genetics, hormonal imbalances, aging, and more. Approximately 70 million Americans experience hair loss. By the age of 35, two-thirds of males already lose some or all of their hair and it also impacts about 50% of women in the United States. Scalp psoriasis is another critical factor which can accelerate growth in the hair care market. The global hair care market was valued at $82.3 billion in 2022. IMARC Group expects the market to reach $107.2 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.4% during the forecast period of 2023 to 2028.To benefit from this growing industry, some of the best hair care stocks to invest in include The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

Japan’s new government passed a large stimulus bill after its economy contracted in the third quarter. Despite these actions, sentiment remains decidedly negative in these regions. We continue to see solid consumer demand in Asia, which has benefited our luxury and cosmetics holdings L’Oreal.”10. Natura &amp;Co Holding S.A.

(NASDAQ:OLPX) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Within capital markets, the U.S. initial public offering (IPO) market remained active with $27 billion in deals during the third quarter, while chunky secondary offerings from private holders weighed on selected equities. We remained selective in the new issue market, participating in the IPO of Olaplex Holdings in the consumer staples sector. Olaplex is a marketer of hair care products targeting a massive consumer market where it is less than 1% penetrated. The company possesses a differentiated model driven by 1) a patented “bond building” ingredient, 2) a devout stylist community and social media presence that is larger than its mass channel peers, and 3) a fully outsourced model that borders on licensing.”7. Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SBH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SBH) is a Texas-based specialty retailer and distributor of professional beauty supplies. The company offers beauty products, including hair color and care products, styling tools, skin care products, cosmetics, and other beauty products for retail customers and salon professionals through retail stores and digital platforms.

(NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) is one of the hair care stocks on the radar of smart investors. Wedgewood Partners made the following comment about Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE)  in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) was a detractor in the quarter as the Company continues to deal with a variety of headwinds. The Company’s healthcare and housewares businesses were major beneficiaries during the pandemic, and both we and the Company have been expecting a normalization of demand in this business. Further, the post-pandemic normalization of demand patterns at major customers such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon have further weighed on the Company – both in terms of fundamentals and in terms of market sentiment, plus stock valuation. Finally, decades-high inflation in key consumer staples categories such as food and other necessities has diverted some spending away from the more discretionary product categories supplied by Helen of Troy. Despite all these headwinds, the Company has been able to hold on to most of the business that it gained during the Pandemic. Revenues in the most recent quarter were +26% above the same quarter two years ago, and we find the stock’s valuation to be extremely attractive at the moment, at levels last seen in the 2008- 2009 recession period, when the Company was under former (and, in our opinion, inept) management.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy Now.  Suggested articles:50 Poorest Countries in the World15 Companies That Are Buying Back Stock15 Most Advanced Countries in Europe Disclosure: None. 11 Best Hair Care Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Click to skip ahead and see George Soros Net Worth and Top 5 Holdings Heading into 2023.Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) are some of the top holdings of billionaire hedge fund titan and somewhat controversial philanthropist George Soros.George Soros’ Soros Fund Management is the family office of the legendary money manager, which was closed to outside investors way back in 2011, when Soros was already 81 years old. Now 92, George Soros’ net worth is still significant at an estimated $8.5 billion according to Bloomberg, which ranks him as the 227th wealthiest people in the world.The fact George Soros’ net worth ranks him that low is testament to how rapidly the 0.01% are accumulating wealth, as $8.5 billion would’ve ranked him 80th back in 2010. In fact, Soros actually ranked 35th at that time according to Forbes, with a net worth of $14 billion, trailing only Warren Buffett among money managers. He’s since been surpassed by several other money managers, including Jim Simons, Ken Griffin, Ray Dalio, and Steve Cohen.Of course, closing your hedge fund to outside money and the enormous fees that can be generated from it will have that affect. But beyond that, Soros has also donated a significant portion of his wealth to various causes over the years, estimated to be as much as $32 billion. His family office now manages much of the wealth that has been poured into his philanthropic ventures, which have a combined $18 billion in assets under management. All told, Soros Fund Management has about $28 billion in assets under management.A lot of those philanthropic donations have been earmarked for the Open Society Foundations, which Soros himself founded in 1979 with the aim of combating authoritarian regimes and building free and open societies (as its name suggests), among other initiatives that generally promote human rights. The group hasn’t been without controversy though, particularly when it comes to allegations of political interference (though that’s kind of the group’s stated aim). It’s also been criticized for a lack of transparency about its funding and the groups it supports (and why) even as it pushes for governments to be more transparent.Story continuesMoving away from George Soros’ net worth and what he’s been up to with his considerable wealth, let’s dig into his top ten holdings heading into 2023. Unlike many money managers this year, which have reshaped their portfolios to be more defensive, Soros and the fund’s chief executive and chief investment officer, Dawn Fitzpatrick, have generally remained aggressive, with big investments in numerous growth stocks, including EV maker Rivian, which had been Soros’ top holding for the previous three quarters heading into Q3.Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio contained $5.86 billion in assets as of September 30, up from $5.62 billion a quarter earlier. About 35% of those assets were in consumer discretionary stocks, though the fund’s exposure to that sector is down considerably from 54% at the end of 2021. Finance, health, real estate, and tech stocks also constituted a noteworthy percentage of the fund’s asset allocation as of September 30.Let’s check out which stocks Soros and his team are banking on heading into 2023 and beyond.George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings Heading into 2023 George Soros of Soros Fund ManagementOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Soros Fund Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. Note that Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y), which ranked as Soros’ sixth-largest holding on September 30, has been omitted from the list given that the company was acquired by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in October and is no longer a public company. We did include two other top holdings of Soros which were recently acquired given their additions are more material to their acquirer’s operations.We follow hedge funds like Soros Fund Management because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns. All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings Heading into 202310. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $96.9 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 359 D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent an eclectic mix of billionaire George Soros’ top ten holdings heading into 2023. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also surges into the top ten after Soros’ family office raised its stake in the tech giant by 1,806% during Q3 to over 1.01 million shares.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares got battered in 2022, losing 39% of their value, as investors worry about the state of the advertising market, which accounts for about 80% of Alphabet’s revenue. Not only is the overall state of advertising a concern, but more specifically Alphabet’s place within it, as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet’s collective control of the market has now slipped below 50%. Nonetheless, there’s little doubt that Alphabet will retain a strong grip on the advertising market for years to come, while its cloud and Web3 businesses help facilitate the company’s overall growth.Stewart Asset Management likes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ability to grow earnings even during recessionary periods, as discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“We invest in businesses with strong, resilient earnings growth which are less cyclical. In the pandemic recession of 2020, the aggregate earnings of the portfolios we manage did not decline year-over-year, and in fact grew, albeit modestly. Looking at the Great Recession which began at year-end 2007 and lasted to mid-year 2009 is helpful too. Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), then called Google, reported earnings that doubled from 2007 to 2010.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $97.5 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 119 Cloud-based customer management platform operator Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) further diversifies the investing icon’s top holdings. Soros Fund Management raised its stake in the company by 8% during Q3 to 677,579 shares.Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of Jim Cramer's 5 Comeback Stocks after the company’s shares got battered by 48% in 2022. Salesforce’s sales growth has ticked down this year amid a challenging recessionary environment that has companies pulling back on their spending somewhat, but it certainly hasn’t slowed enough to justify the massive pullback in the stock.During the nine months of 2022 between February and October, the company grew sales by 20% year-over-year, down from 25% growth during the same period a year earlier. And longer-term, Salesforce has a tremendous growth opportunity both in the U.S and abroad, with a total addressable market that the company estimates at $290 billion by 2026, about 9x greater than the revenue Salesforce is projected to pull in during its fiscal 2023 year ended January 31, 2023.Aristotle Atlantic sold off Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in Q3, expressing doubts about the company’s projected $50 billion FY26 revenue in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”8. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $103 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 86 Soros Fund Management cut its stake in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) by 21% during Q3 to 1.39 million shares, which wasn’t enough to knock the stock out of its top ten holdings. There’s been a 22% decline in hedge fund ownership of LBRDA since the end of 2020, when the stock was among the 30 most popular among hedge funds.Despite LBRDA shares sliding by 53% in 2022, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) continues to trade at a discount to its net asset value, which may be why Soros likes the stock as a long-term investment. One of the company’s primary assets is a 26% ownership stake in Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), which is being all but written off by investors due to that company’s lackluster short-term customer growth (or lack thereof).Weitz Investment Management took a deep dive into Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)’s Charter investment in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We believe this to be the case for Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) (owner of 26% of broadband provider Charter Communications). As one of the Fund›s largest positions and its outsized impact as the top detractor for the quarter and year-to-date periods, a more detailed discussion of our continued optimism is warranted.Investors have apparently extrapolated that Charter’s recent string of lackluster broadband customer growth portends zero (or negative) growth into perpetuity. Skeptics point to early customer wins for wireless broadband offerings and fiber-network operators’ plans to aggressively expand their footprints as evidence that Charter’s (and cable operators’, generally) ability to add subscribers is permanently impaired. We disagree. Wireless broadband will likely continue to win customers in areas where wired infrastructure is unavailable or by expanding the market to new customer segments (e.g., construction trailers, food trucks, etc.). That said, the carriers face an important trade-off, as fixed wireless is a lower-return usage of scarce network capacity. As fixed and mobile data usage inexorably grow, we believe carriers will prioritize their traditional mobility business at the expense of expanding their fixed wireless base. With respect to growing competition from fiber-to-the-home operators, Charter’s footprint is already roughly 40% overbuilt and has been competing successfully for over a decade. As fiber companies look to enact previously announced expansion plans, inflationary pressures for labor, equipment, and funding costs may reduce their ultimate appetites…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $108 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Soros Fund trimmed its stake in Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) by 10% during Q3 to 8.8 million shares. Nonetheless, the fund holds a nearly 5% stake in the company and the largest position in it among the select group of leading hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.If you’re of the mind that investing in a company that operates bowling centers isn’t an exciting or high-growth opportunity, you’re surely not alone, but Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL) just might prove otherwise. There’s a reason BOWL shares crushed the broader market in 2022, gaining 53%, as the company continues to expand and grow at a rapid rate.In Bowlero Corp. (NYSE:BOWL)’s Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript, the company revealed that it grew adjusted EBITDA ($65 million) by 11% year-over-year in its fiscal Q1 and by 162% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Its revenue has likewise surged by 56% compared to pre-pandemic levels in the first 18 weeks of its fiscal 2023 year, including a 36% jump in same-store sales. So Bowlero isn’t just growing compared to weaker pandemic comps or primarily due to its expansion (it has about 10% more bowling centers now than it did at the start of FY22, 325 in total); it’s pulling in significantly more revenue and generating far more cash across the board.6. Aramark (NYSE:ARMK)Value of Soros Fund Management’s 13F Position: $114 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 35 Soros’ stake in Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) was inched up by 2% during Q3, with the billionaire’s family office owning 3.66 million ARMK shares on September 30. Hedge fund ownership of the stock has risen during each of the past three quarters, climbing by 35% during that time.Philadelphia-based Aramark (NYSE:ARMK), which provides food, hospitality, and facilities services to a variety of industries, benefited greatly in its fiscal 2022 from continued reopenings in areas such as business and education.In its Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript, Aramark (NYSE:ARMK) noted that it generated about $790 million in net new business in its fiscal 2022 in terms of client retention, which was about 750% higher than its historical five-year average between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. So it continues to grow its business and retain both new and existing customers at strong rates (95%), which sets it up well to achieve its longer-term growth targets.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), and Rivian Automotive, Inc.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Eaton is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.8b ÷ (US$34b - US$6.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Eaton has an ROCE of 10%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%. View our latest analysis for Eaton roceIn the above chart we have measured Eaton's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Eaton.The Trend Of ROCEThere hasn't been much to report for Eaton's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if Eaton doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Eaton has been paying out a decent 43% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Eaton's ROCEIn summary, Eaton isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 122% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Eaton that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams What Is Sherwin-Williams Worth?According to my valuation model, Sherwin-Williams seems to be fairly priced at around 10.80% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Sherwin-Williams today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $214.19, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Sherwin-Williams’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Sherwin-Williams look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 50% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sherwin-Williams. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SHW’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SHW, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. While conducting our analysis, we found that Sherwin-Williams has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you are no longer interested in Sherwin-Williams, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

California American Water is requesting recovery of infrastructure costs needed to extract, distribute, and deliver water from the expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project. California American Water supports the project as a critical component of the future water supply portfolio for its Monterey Peninsula customers and urges the CPUC to approve the funds for the infrastructure needed for the project.""California American Water has built new infrastructure and advanced funding to our partner agency because we support the expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project. This project is needed to reduce pumping from the Carmel River, and this infrastructure is needed for the project,"" said Kevin Tilden, president of California American Water. ""We encourage the CPUC to grant a rapid rehearing to address the problems and allow us to move forward with the water purchase agreement.""In its recent decision (D 22-12-001) on the project expansion, the Commission erroneously delayed recovery of infrastructure investments made by the company to support the project expansion, changed capital structures for project development and contradicts CPUC precedent and practice. The decision as written has substantial negative impacts to the company, its customers and the region. California American Water has requested a swift review of the decision to correct the errors and allow the company to move forward with the project agreement.In November 2021, California American Water, Monterey One Water and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District all signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to proceed with a purchase agreement for water provided by Monterey One Water Expansion if the CPUC approved recovery of infrastructure costs advanced by California American Water. The company remains committed to the terms of the MOU.Story continuesOther parties to the proceeding may also file with the CPUC applications for rehearing by January 4, 2023, or responses to the rehearing request by January 19, 2023.Together, the recently approved desalination plant and the Pure Water Monterey Expansion will allow the community to replace water it is currently using from the Carmel River and comply with the direction from the State Water Resources Control Board to do so.About California American Water:California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 725,000 people.

However, don’t count them out just yet. Global leaders are demanding millions of EVs on the roads in an effort to reduce emissions. The U.S. wants to reduce emissions by 52%. Europe is targeting 55%. China even says it will stop releasing carbon dioxide in the next 40 years.The International Energy Agency says we could see up to 135 million electric vehicles on the roads in the next decade. Analysts at Ernst &amp; Young say EVs could outpace combustion engines globally over the same period. Bloomberg NEF says that, by 2030, more than half of passenger cars sold in the United States will be electric, driven in part by incentives put in place by the Inflation Reduction Act.That being said, I’d start buying beaten-down electric vehicle stocks, and related stocks, for longer-term growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsALBAlbemarle$213.97KARSKraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility$27.56FCXFreeport McMoRan$37.74CHPTChargePoint$8.30FDRVFidelity EVs and Future Transportation ETF$14.77Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. LITM Stock.Source: tunasalmon / ShutterstockAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is one of the top electric vehicle stocks to own heading into 2023. Not only is it ridiculously oversold, but it’s also one of the top ways to trade the lithium story.As the world continues to deal with a tight supply-demand issue with lithium, ALB is well-positioned to capitalize. For one, the company drew about 60% of its sales from lithium in the third quarter. Two, company revenues are surging along with lithium prices, which soared about 100% year-over-year.We also have to remember the lithium story isn’t cooling off — at least not anytime soon. For an idea of just how tight the lithium situation is, Forbes.com contributor Tristan Bove says, “At current extraction rates, carmakers will need more mining to hit industry forecasts of as many as 300 million electric vehicles on the road worldwide by 2030, as will countries to meet their commitments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.”Story continuesKrane Shares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility (KARS)Photo of charging port on electric vehicle (EV) plugged into and being chargedSource: shutterstock.com/Nixx PhotographyIt’s never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, you want to diversity for safety, with an exchange-traded fund such as the Krane Shares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility (NYSEARCA:KARS). With this fund, all your eggs are in different baskets: electric vehicles, autonomous driving, lithium and copper production, hydrogen fuel and semiconductors. In fact, you’re safer diversifying with an ETF like KARS, than putting all your money in a single stock like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).With an expense ratio of 0.70%, some of the KARS ETF top holdings include Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY), Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) and dozens more. Also, while the KARS ETF is down about 46% from its 2021 highs, give it time. As the EV story improves, I’d like to see the ETF again challenge its former high of $54.43.Freeport McMoRan (FCX)Piece of copper set against black backgroundSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.comAnother key component of the electric vehicle story is copper. That’s because EVs use about two and a half times more copper than your combustion engine cars, which could help pull Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) well off recent lows.In fact, “Between today and 2035, achieving the net-zero emissions by 2050 goals will translate into a rapid ramp-up of copper demand, increasing by more than 82 percent between 2021 and 2035,” according to S&amp;P Global analysts, as quoted by InvestingNews.com. “This ramp-up is largely driven by the required transition to clean vehicles and electrification of the economy.”Helping, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) CEO and FCX Director, Ryan Lance, just bought $988,300 worth of FCX stock at an average price of $31.88 each. Better, FCX just declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share on FCX’s common stock, payable on Feb. 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Jan. 13, 2023. From a current price of $37.74, I’d like to see the FCX stock rally back to $50, especially as copper prices recover.ChargePoint (CHPT)An image of an EV plugged in and charging, with blue light wisps flowing outward from the plug. EV stocks.Source: Blue Planet Studio / ShutterstockWith the electric vehicle boom set to accelerate, we’ll need a good deal of charging stations, which is great news for companies like ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT). After all, we can’t have millions of EVs on the roads, and not have anywhere to charge them.“With the total cumulative investment in EV charging infrastructure in the United States and Europe expected to be $60 billion by 2030 and $192 billion by 2040, ChargePoint’s established business model, comprehensive portfolio for nearly every charging scenario today, recurring revenue and growing customer base demonstrate it is well positioned to continue to lead as the electric mobility revolution accelerates,” says the company.Helping, the Biden Administration is committed to building a national network of 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030.Earnings have been solid, too. Third-quarter revenue, for example, was up 93% to $125.3 million YoY. Networked charging systems revenue for the third quarter was $97.6 million, up 105% from $47.5 million YoY. Also, subscription revenue was $21.7 million, up 62% from $13.4 million YoY. For Q4 2022, CHPT expects revenue to fall in the range of $160 million to $170 million, which would be 108% above year-ago numbers.Fidelity Electric Vehicles and Future Transportation ETF (FDRV)Electric Cars Charging Station Closeup Photo.

(NASDAQ:PEP) sold US$12m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-130055296.html,1672578055,STORY,['PEP'],"[The fact that multiple PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.1m worth of shares at a price of US$176 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$181, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 15% of Hugh Johnston's stake.Insiders in PepsiCo didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At PepsiCo Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PepsiCo. In total, insiders sold US$6.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that PepsiCo insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$380m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PepsiCo Insiders?Insiders haven't bought PepsiCo stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that PepsiCo is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Union Pacific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$10b ÷ (US$65b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceIn the above chart we have measured Union Pacific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Union Pacific here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Union Pacific Tell Us?Things have been pretty stable at Union Pacific, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Union Pacific doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Union Pacific has been paying out a decent 43% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Union Pacific's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Union Pacific's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 67% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Union Pacific, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?
