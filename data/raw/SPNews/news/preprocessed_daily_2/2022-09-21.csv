The top line surpassed the consensus mark by 7.1% in the last reported quarter and increased 19% year over year.The company's earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 25 of the trailing 28 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has remained unchanged over the past 60 days at $2.67 per share. The projected figure indicates a 62.8% increase from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.64 per share. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.86 billion, suggesting a rise of 26.8% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.KB Home Price and EPS SurpriseKB Home Price and EPS SurpriseKB Home price-eps-surprise | KB Home QuoteFactors at PlayRevenues: KB Home’s housing revenues are expected to have increased in the fiscal third quarter from the year-ago quarter’s levels, given the robust backlog level. Also, a solid return-focused growth model is likely to have aided growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Homebuilding revenues — including housing and land — is pegged at $1,863 million, indicating an increase of 27.4% from the year-ago period’s levels. Within Homebuilding, the consensus mark for housing revenues is pegged at $1,860 million, calling for a rise of 27.2% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. The same for land revenues is pegged at $3.3 million, indicating an increase from $0.25 million in the year-ago quarter. It expects housing revenues in the range of $1.82-$1.92 billion.Higher pricing is expected to have been a major contributing factor. The consensus estimate for the average selling price is $494,000, indicating growth from $427,000 reported a year ago. For the quarter, the company expects an average selling price of $495,000.The consensus estimate for homes delivered is pegged at 3,766 units, suggesting a rise from the year-ago quarter’s level of 3,425 units.Orders &amp; Backlogs: A solid backlog level, a key indicator of significant growth opportunities, is likely to have been a positive. The consensus estimate for the backlog is 12,245 units, implying notable growth from 10,694 units reported in the prior year.Yet, the consensus mark for new orders is currently pegged at 3,680 units, suggesting a year-over-year decline from 4,085 units, given the ongoing affordability issues and higher mortgage rates in the industry.Margins: Higher average prices are likely to have expanded margins in the to-be-reported quarter. Although higher material and labor costs are likely to have put pressure on the bottom line, initiatives like the Returns-Focused Growth Plan and Built-to-Order approach are likely to have somewhat offset those headwinds.The company expects the homebuilding operating income margin (excluding the impact of any inventory-related charges) to improve to 16.9% for the quarter, suggesting an increase from 11.6% a year ago.Assuming no inventory-related charges, KB Home expects fiscal third-quarter housing gross margin in the range of 26.5%. In the year-ago period, the metric was 22%. The SG&amp;A expense ratio will be 9.6% of housing revenues compared with 9.9% reported in the year-ago period.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for KB Home this time around.

AYI need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 18, 2022 $145.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Acuity Brands shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Acuity Brands is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Building Products - Lighting industry that ranks in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.40 per share to $3.35 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Acuity Brands right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

3,16461ceb-9bb3-3cba-9b77-0693763fecc0,ARE,2022-09-21,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-132201494.html,1663680121,STORY,['ARE'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.18 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.17%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.05% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.69%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.36%. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;CTO Realty (CTO) is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 7.43% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.05% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 12% over the past year. Check CTO Realty (CTO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.16 per share, Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) has a dividend yield of 4.42%. This is compared to the Banks - Midwest industry's yield of 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 3.33%. Check Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Check Out These 2 Basic Materials Names,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-stocks-positive-earnings-momentum-130001057.html,1663678801,STORY,"['NUE', 'APD']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nucor (NUE) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $8 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 20, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $8 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.97 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nucor has an Earnings ESP of 0.38%.NUE is just one of a large group of Basic Materials stocks with a positive ESP figure. Air Products and Chemicals (APD) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on November 3, 2022, Air Products and Chemicals holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.79 a share 44 days from its next quarterly update.Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.34% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78.Story continuesNUE and APD's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A surprising percentage of employees are ready to quit their jobs and start a business, and budget cutting due to the economy is reducing financial support for charity, friends and family only half as much as household spending. These are some of the findings of the recently released 2022 Aflac Risk Survey of 1,644 American adults. A leading provider of supplemental health insurance in the U.S., the $22 billion supplemental insurance company annually surveys Americans on matters of topical importance.Other findings from this year's survey include:Nearly 90% of Americans list proactively managing risks to mental health as a priority compared to 80% who are concerned about the state of the U.S. economy, 61% who are concerned about the effects of politics on their household, and 54% who are concerned about the impact of COVID-19.About 57% of Americans with incomes over $150,000 reported that ""proactively managing risks to your and your family's mental health"" has grown in importance over the last couple of years versus only 40% with incomes of $35,000 and under, pointing to a potential mental health equity gap.Nearly 1 in 6 Americans are somewhat or very likely to quit their jobs and start a business, including more than half of self-reported ""absolute risk-takers."" For those whose likelihood of starting their own business has changed in the past couple of years, more than 4 in 10 are more likely to do so, meaning that while people want to work, they don't necessarily want to work for another company.While 9 out of 10 of those making changes in household budgets are cutting their own spending, less than half are reducing the support they provide to friends, families and charitable causes they care most about.Story continues""After a major pandemic, economic challenges, social justice anxieties and political unrest, Americans are reassessing their approach to mental health, seeing it as a greater risk to themselves and their families than it was just two years ago,"" said Aflac Senior Vice President of Group Voluntary Benefits Bob Ruff. ""How people manage these risks has a lot to do with their income and education, showcasing the likelihood of a health care gap for mental illness that must be addressed.""In 2022, Aflac added mental health components to several products in response to a growing need for access to emotional and mental stress mitigation tools. According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, 21%, or nearly 53 million U.S. adults, experienced mental illness in 2020, and 46% of adults with mental illness received treatment. Serious mental illness causes $193.2 billion in lost earnings each year.1""The last two years have awakened an entrepreneurial spirit among Americans, particularly those who self-identify as 'risk takers,"" said Aflac Senior Vice President of Distribution Expansion and Consumer Markets Jeramy Tipton. ""While it seems that people want to work, they don't all necessarily want to work for someone else, which will have a significant impact on how people will obtain health care benefits potentially through consumer-directed platforms as the gig economy continues to grow. It is important to note, however, that risk-taking does not equal recklessness. These individuals take great care to manage risk since they know they cannot avoid it.""Aflac currently provides many consumer-directed products, including those for Cancer, Critical Illness, Accident, Final Expense Whole Life and Medicare Supplement. The company plans to add additional consumer-directed products to the roster of available policies in 2022 and 2023.The 2022 Aflac Risk Survey was conducted online July 8-9, 2022, among 1,644 American adults age 18 and older.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. BJ, NextEra Energy Partners LP NEP, Alliant Energy Corp. LNT, Potbelly Corp. PBPB and ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. ARR.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top U.S.-Focused Stocks Amid Surging Interest Rates and U.S. DollarWall Street has been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022, barring a two-month summer rally. Market participants continue to be affected by the after-effects of COVID-19 even though the infection has itself dwindled. These, along with the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and shortage of labor, have caused the inflation rate to skyrocket to a 40-year high.In order to combat galloping inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance unseen since 1994. Rigorous hiking of the benchmark interest rate and the adoption of a tighter monetary policy have resulted in a surge in U.S. currency.A higher interest rate regime has already raised the value of the U.S. dollar in the international market. At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in stocks of domestic-business-oriented companies with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are — BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc., NextEra Energy Partners LP, Alliant Energy Corp., Potbelly Corp. and ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc.Surging Interest RateThe U.S. inflation rate is currently at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed raised the Fed Fund rate from 0-0.25% in early March to 2.25-2.5% in July. Yet, there are no signs of inflation cooling down. After back-to-back FOMC meetings in June and July, the Fed is set to hike the interest rate by another 75 basis points in September.Story continuesA section of economists and financial analysts is expecting the central bank to raise the rate by 1% in the September FOMC meeting. Moreover, the Fed terminated the pandemic-led $120 billion of bond-buying program per month in March and has started reducing the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet from June.Consequently, the yields of U.S. government bonds soared. As of Sep 19, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.518%, its highest since April 2011. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.949%, its highest since 2007. This yield is most susceptible to the Fed’s rate hike strategy. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.521%.Dollar-Index SkyrocketsAs interest rate surges in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets in order to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed in 2022.As of Sep 19, the DXY closed at 109.586, climbing 14.6% year to date. The index is currently at its 20-year high. With respect to the U.S. dollar, the British pound is at a 37-year low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Further, currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low level against the U.S. dollar.Why Domestic- Focused Stocks?Market participants are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Domestic business-oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shock since the United States is the lone market for their products.Despite the recent economic slowdown, aggregate demand in the U.S. economy is rock solid. Americans have more than $2 trillion in savings in the last two pandemic-ridden years. The Fed is trying to cool demand by an aggressive rate hike and liquidity reduction from the system to combat higher inflation.In order to fund expansion, these companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers. This makes them less sensitive to the interest rate movement and will help them to outperform the broader market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five domestic business-oriented U.S. stocks that have solid potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.BJ's Wholesale Club’s ability to steer the tough retail environment validates its strong customer value proposition and business model. BJ’s relentless efforts to boost membership base, simplify assortments, enhance digital capabilities and accelerate club openings should support sales. We foresee sustained improvement in membership fee income as new club openings ramp up.Markedly, BJ's Wholesale Club’s acquisition of the perishable supply chain from Burris Logistics puts it in an advantageous position to scale up supply chain capabilities and expand fresh food offerings. A jump of 6% in member count in the second quarter speaks about BJ’s ability to drive traffic. We estimate a 14.3% and 7.1% increase in total revenues in fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively.BJ's Wholesale Club has an expected earnings growth rate of 10.8% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings of this Zacks Rank #1 company has improved 7.8% over the past 30 days.NextEra Energy is expanding domestic clean energy assets through acquisitions and organic initiatives. NEP has stakes in natural gas pipelines in Texas and gains from an increase in natural gas production.To enhance flexibility, NextEra Energy completed a few financing agreements to secure funds for acquisition. NEP benefits from declining installation costs and improving renewable technology. It has sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.NextEra Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings of this Zacks Rank #2 company has improved 3.2% over the past 30 days.Alliant Energy has plans to strengthen and expand its infrastructure, retire coal-fired units, add clean assets to its generation and become carbon neutral by 2050. Electricity generated from clean assets will assist LNT in meeting demand from customers.Alliant Energy plans to invest $6.1 billion between 2022 and 2025. The returns from regulated assets provide it with earnings visibility. LNT operates primarily through four wholly owned subsidiaries – Interstate Power and Light Co., Wisconsin Power and Light Co., Resource and Corporate Services.Zacks Rank #2 Alliant Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.8% over the past 60 days.Potbelly owns, operates, and franchises Potbelly sandwich shops. PBPB manages establishments for consuming food on premises and offers sandwiches, salads, soups, chili, chips, cookies, ice cream and smoothies.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved more than 100% over the past 60 days.ARMOUR Residential invests primarily in residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by a United States government-chartered entity.

7,4f409093-ebab-3e05-b38e-39142c40cee9,LNT,2022-09-21,Top 5 US-Focused Stocks Amid Surging Interest Rate and Dollar,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-us-focused-stocks-140302891.html,1663682582,STORY,"['LNT', 'BJ', 'NEE', 'PBPB', 'ARR']","[Wall Street has been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022, barring a two-month summer rally. Market participants continue to be affected by the after-effects of COVID-19 even though the infection has itself dwindled. These, along with the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and shortage of labor, have caused the inflation rate to skyrocket to a 40-year high.In order to combat galloping inflation, the Fed has adopted an ultra-hawkish monetary stance unseen since 1994. Rigorous hiking of the benchmark interest rate and the adoption of a tighter monetary policy have resulted in a surge in U.S. currency.A higher interest rate regime has already raised the value of the U.S. dollar in the international market. At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in stocks of domestic-business-oriented companies with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are — BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. BJ, NextEra Energy Partners LP NEP, Alliant Energy Corp. LNT, Potbelly Corp. PBPB and ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. ARR.Surging Interest RateThe U.S. inflation rate is currently at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed raised the Fed Fund rate from 0-0.25% in early March to 2.25-2.5% in July. Yet, there are no signs of inflation cooling down. After back-to-back FOMC meetings in June and July, the Fed is set to hike the interest rate by another 75 basis points in September.A section of economists and financial analysts is expecting the central bank to raise the rate by 1% in the September FOMC meeting. Moreover, the Fed terminated the pandemic-led $120 billion of bond-buying program per month in March and has started reducing the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet from June.Consequently, the yields of U.S. government bonds soared. As of Sep 19, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.518%, its highest since April 2011. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.949%, its highest since 2007. This yield is most susceptible to the Fed’s rate hike strategy. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.521%.Story continuesDollar-Index SkyrocketsAs interest rate surges in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets in order to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed in 2022.As of Sep 19, the DXY closed at 109.586, climbing 14.6% year to date. The index is currently at its 20-year high. With respect to the U.S. dollar, the British pound is at a 37-year low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Further, currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low level against the U.S. dollar.Why Domestic- Focused Stocks?Market participants are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Domestic business-oriented companies are mostly immune to any external shock since the United States is the lone market for their products.Despite the recent economic slowdown, aggregate demand in the U.S. economy is rock solid. Americans have more than $2 trillion in savings in the last two pandemic-ridden years. The Fed is trying to cool demand by an aggressive rate hike and liquidity reduction from the system to combat higher inflation.In order to fund expansion, these companies are less likely to take the debt route compared with their large peers. This makes them less sensitive to the interest rate movement and will help them to outperform the broader market.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five domestic business-oriented U.S. stocks that have solid potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days.
