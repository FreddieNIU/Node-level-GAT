It has amassed assets over $30.65 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.57%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 28% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 5.69% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 22.68% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHX seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market measures all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. The index includes approximately the largest 750 stocks and is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 4.56% so far this year and is down about -3.86% in the last one year (as of 03/08/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.25 and $55.09.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25.08% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 760 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHX is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $298.16 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $354.66 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Charles Schwab, FNDB has amassed assets over $486.07 million, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Value.

The SEC also proposed lower trading increments and access fees on exchanges, and more robust retail order execution disclosures.The aim of the proposed rules is to improve market quality and efficiency, by boosting competition for retail stock orders and reducing unnecessary intermediation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said.The NYSE, along with Schwab and Citadel Securities, asked the SEC to indefinitely withdraw the auction and best execution proposals, saying they could lead to less market liquidity and create confusing regulatory overlap.""We believe that this more targeted approach will result in significant benefits for U.S. equity market participants, while meaningfully reducing the risk of negative outcomes for markets and investors, including the risk of firms retreating from being liquidity providers - which would be particularly detrimental to retail investors,"" they said.The SEC will review all comments submitted during the open comment period, and generally responds to comments received as part of the final rule-making and not beforehand, a spokesperson for the agency said.

The new regulations, if finalized, could damp liquidity in the market, the firms said.“We are deeply concerned that the commission has simultaneously issued multiple far-reaching proposals that would dramatically overhaul current market structure without adequately assessing the cumulative impact on the market or the potential for unintended consequences,” the companies said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg News.The SEC “benefits from robust engagement from the public and will review all comments submitted during the open comment period,” the agency said in a statement. “Generally, we respond to comments received as part of the final rulemaking and not beforehand.”The SEC released four proposals on Dec. 14 that Chair Gary Gensler has said would boost transparency and competition. They are a cornerstone of his rulemaking agenda and delve into the guts of how the market works, affecting everything from order routing to pricing and disclosures that brokers must make to clients.In their letter, NYSE, Citadel Securities and Schwab urged the regulator to take a more deliberative approach to changes.They recommended that the SEC set minimum quoting increments to a half-penny for some stocks and to harmonize trading increments for all symbols trading at or above $1 a share.Story continuesThey also called on the agency to withdraw a proposal requiring many more equity orders to be sent to an auction mechanism. “At a minimum, the proposal should be indefinitely paused” until the execution-quality impact of other suggested changes is known, they wrote.‘Best Execution’Another proposal would force broker-dealers for all assets, including fixed-income and options, to obtain “best execution” on their clients’ trades. That measure would create an SEC-specific rule for the industry, which currently operates under guidelines and rules set by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, an industry-backed watchdog.That proposal should also be withdrawn, according to the NYSE, Citadel Securities and Schwab. “We are concerned that the current best execution proposal, with overly prescriptive and impractical requirements for managing a new category of so-called ‘conflicted transactions’ may unnecessarily disrupt decades of market progress for investors,” they said.The joint letter should be taken “in the spirit of compromise and collective progress — to ensure the “gold standard” status of our markets is maintained,” NYSE president Lynn Martin said in a website post Monday.In an emailed statement, Schwab said it was still reviewing the four proposals and their “likely impact” on clients. It said it “will offer additional comments for the commission’s consideration in the near future.”(Updates with SEC and company comments, industry recommendations starting in fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out—Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsHow Countries Leading on Early Years of Child Care Get It RightPayPal Is Searching for a CEO Who Can Reverse Its $279 Billion Stock Drop©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.36bUS$5.84bUS$6.74bUS$10.3bUS$10.8bUS$11.2bUS$11.6bUS$11.9bUS$12.3bUS$12.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.70%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.87%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$4.0kUS$4.9kUS$5.1kUS$7.1kUS$6.8kUS$6.5kUS$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.3kUS$5.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$56bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.1%) = US$168bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$168b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$67bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$123b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$172, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.281. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Texas InstrumentsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityTXN's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For Texas Instruments, there are three essential elements you should further examine:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments  you should be aware of, and 2 of them make us uncomfortable.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for TXN's future outlook?

16,d2fd51d4-736d-3811-ac75-f8aee14579ce,RRC,2023-03-09,Range Resources (RRC) Set to Gain From Higher Gas Prices,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-resources-rrc-set-gain-150003535.html,1678201203,STORY,"['RRC', 'LNG', 'AR']","[Range Resources RRC is set to make steady profits in 2023, as the outlook for the medium term suggests that energy prices will remain high. The strong commodity prices will likely drive the financial success of the company.Although global commodity prices tumbled in the second half of 2022, natural gas prices are expected to remain elevated this year. The strong commodity price will likely aid RRC’s operations, as it is among the leading natural gas producers in the United States.Range Resources is an Appalachian explorer, one of the largest natural gas producers in the United States. In the prolific Appalachian Basin, it has a strong focus on stacked-pay gas projects. In the Marcellus formation of the basin, it has a multi-decade inventory of premium drilling locations. It has 3,000 undrilled wells in the region, signaling a bright production outlook.For 2023, Range Resources expects total production of 2.12-2.16 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (Bcfe/d), the mid-point of which suggests an improvement from 2.12 Bcfe/d reported last year. Higher production will boost the company’s bottom line. As most of its production comprises natural gas (almost 69% in Q4), RRC is well-positioned to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy.The company is focusing on cost improvement and marketing strategies to increase its margins. Owing to the peer-leading well cost and low maintenance capital requirements, RRC is likely to generate free cash flow in the near term. Also, the company has the lowest emission intensity among the upstream companies in the United States.Higher natural gas investments are expected in 2023. In the United States, excess natural gas is being produced in order to reduce emissions and export additional supplies to Europe. Certified natural gas and carbon-neutral LNG are expected to gain momentum in 2023.The favorable outcomes are set to improve this year, owing to a perfect storm of factors pushing profits. Companies like EQT Corporation EQT, Antero Resources AR and Cheniere Energy Inc. LNG will continue to witness gains as the commodity price trajectory is expected to remain healthy.Story continuesEQT has lower exposure to debt capital than composite stocks belonging to the industry. Hence, the upstream energy player can rely on its strong balance sheet to sail through the volatility in commodity prices. Apart from reducing its debt load, EQT is focused on generating strong free cash flows and rewarding its shareholders.Moreover, of the total greenhouse-gas emission reductions in the United States since 2005, the contribution of EQT is roughly 5%. EQT aims to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025.Antero Resources has positioned itself among the fast-growing natural gas producers in the United States. AR boasts 451,000 and 91,000 net acres in Marcellus and Utica, respectively, which will likely boost its production. Its core acreage position allows for significant long lateral drilling opportunities and capital efficiencies.Antero Resources has been benefiting from declining well costs in the Marcellus play. Being a leading natural gas producer, the firm emits lower greenhouse gases than other oil majors. It is prioritizing reducing debt. From 2019 through 2022, AR successfully managed to lower the absolute debt load by more than $2.5 billion.Although Cheniere does not primarily produce natural gas, it is a global provider of clean, secure and affordable liquefied natural gas. Given the first-mover advantage in the LNG export market, Cheniere is primed for significant revenue and earnings growth on the back of long-term contracts and solid operations.LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record higher prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Most analysts believe that deliveries are poised for further gains this year on surging consumption in Europe and Asia. This augurs well for Cheniere Energy, the dominant LNG exporter in the United States.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RRC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on State Street STT, Everest Re Group RE and AssetMark Financial AMK.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Playa Hotels &amp; Resorts is coming off its best year ever in 2022 with bookings remaining red hot to start 2023. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is leaving the pandemic behind.Playa Hotels &amp; Resorts develops and operates 25 all-inclusive resorts in Mexico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic with 9,352 rooms. If you've ever been to the beach destinations in those three countries you know their resorts.In Mexico, Playa owns and manages Hyatt Zilara Cancún, Hyatt Ziva Cancún, Wyndham Alltra Cancún, Wyndham Alltra Playa del Carmen, Hilton Playa del Carmen All-Inclusive Resort, Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta, and Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos. In Jamaica, Playa owns and manages Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall, Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall, Hilton Rose Hall Resort &amp; Spa, Jewel Grande Montego Bay Resort &amp; Spa and Jewel Paradise Cove Beach Resort &amp; Spa.In the Dominican Republic, Playa owns and manages the Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Family Resort, the Hilton La Romana All-Inclusive Adult Resort, Hyatt Zilara Cap Cana, Hyatt Ziva Cap Cana and Jewel Punta Cana. Playa owned one resort in the Dominican Republic that was managed by a third-party until January 6, 2023 but is now managed by Playa.It also manages 8 resorts on behalf of third-party owners.A Big Beat in the Fourth QuarterAnalysts have underestimated the consumer demand for travel. On Feb 23, Playa Hotels &amp; Resorts reported its fourth quarter and full year results and blew by the Zacks Consensus by $0.14. Earnings were $0.13 versus the Zacks Consensus of a loss of $0.01.It was the fourth earnings beat in a row.Story continuesPlaya had the best year in the company's history and saw acceleration in recovery in the important Jamaica market.Net Package RevPAR was up 21.8% in the fourth quarter to $262.73 from $215.66. For the full year, Net Package RevPAR jumped 67% to $266.93 from $159.88, as Caribbean destinations like Jamaica fully reopened to visitors and COVID testing was eliminated.Fourth quarter comparable portfolio occupancy was up 9.7 points to 75.8% from 66.1% in Q4 2021. This did not include Hilton La Romana, Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara Cap Cana which were closed for a portion of the quarter due to impacts of Hurricane Fiona and subsequent clean-up.Full year comparable occupancy was up 21.7 points to 74.9% from 53.2% as the Caribbean reopened fully from the pandemic restrictions.""Demand has remained robust so far in 2023, with our weekly bookings for our Playa owned and managed resorts reaching new highs,"" said Bruce Wardinski, CEO.""Our revenue on the books for the first half of 2023 at our Playa owned and managed resorts, excluding the recently repositioned Jewel Punta Cana and Jewel Palm Beach, is up over 30%, with ADR growth driving roughly one-third of the increase. Early indications for the summer also look fantastic, with ADR continuing to show year-over-year growth,"" he added.Estimates for 2023 RaisedAfter the bullish guidance for 2023, analysts raised earnings estimates for the full year. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $0.49 from $0.44 just 60 days ago. However, this is still a penny under 2022's earnings of $0.50.But analysts see 2024 as even more bullish, with earnings expected to grow 22.5% to $0.60.Shares Soar in 2023Shares of Playa Hotels &amp; Resorts were originally a pandemic winner in 2021 as the trends in travel improved off the COVID pandemic lows. However, shares sold off again in 2022. The company, however, thought they were attractive and undervalued. The Board of Directors authorized a $100 million share buyback in Sep 2022.As of Jan 31, 2023, there was $43.6 million remaining on that authorization. But on Feb 9, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new $200 million share repurchase, replacing what was left on the Sep 2022 authorization.Shares have soared 44.6% year-to-date and are near new 52-week highs. It's not as cheap, on a P/E basis, as it once was. It trades with a forward P/E of 19.3.But for investors who believe the travel trend is going to stick around for the next few years, you might want to keep an all-inclusive player in the Caribbean, like Playa Hotels &amp; Resorts, on your short list.Bear of the Day:Range Resources Corp. had a record 2022 as natural gas prices soared. But earnings are expected to decline for this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in 2023 as natural gas prices fall.Range Resources is an independent natural gas and NGL producer with operations focused on stacked-pay projects in the Appalachian Basin.Another Beat in the Fourth Quarter 2022On Feb 27, Range Resources reported its fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. It beat on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.18 reporting $1.30 versus the consensus of $1.12For the full year, Range Resources saw record cash from operations of $1.9 billion. Like many energy companies, it returned much of the free cash flow to shareholders in the form of $39 million in dividends, $400 million in share repurchases and $1.1 billion in debt reduction.The key for the energy producers is the 2023 production and the capital guidance plan. It's all-in 2023 capital budget is expected to be $570 to $615 million planned to maintain production at 2.12 to 2.16 Bcfe per day.Range's all-in maintenance capital is expected to be approximately $0.76 per mcfe, among the lowest of the US natural gas producers.Range also increased hedge positions for 2023 and 2024 to approximately 55% and 35% of natural gas production with weighted-average floors of $3.57 and $3.75 per MMBtu, respectively.""As we enter 2023, the progress made during the past year both financially and operationally puts Range in the strongest position in Company history,"" said Jeff Ventura, CEO.Analysts Cut Full Year Earnings EstimatesOver the last 60 days, 9 estimates have been cut pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $3.21 from $4.89 during that time. That is an earnings decline of 37.2% from 2022 as the company made $5.11 in 2022.But 2022 was also a record year.Shares are up in 2023Shares have been on a roller coaster over the last year. They're up just 3.1% during that time. But they have rallied in 2023, running up 11.6%.They're still cheap with a forward P/E of 8.7. And it has a PEG ratio of 0.3. A PEG ratio under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value.Range Resources dividend is currently yielding 1.2%.While Range Resources has a Strong Sell recommendation because of the earnings estimates cuts, it's still cheap. It might be one to keep on the short list for when the Rank changes.Additional content:3 Top Stocks to Gain as Interest Rates Stay Higher for LongerThe recent strength in the U.S. labor market has confirmed that the Federal Reserve will have to do more to curb inflationary pressure. For the week ending Feb 25, Americans filing for jobless benefits dropped to 190,000, less than the 195,000 estimated. New unemployment applications remained below the coveted 200,000 mark for the seventh successive week, indicating sustained resilience in the labor market.By the way, January’s employment report has already remained astounding all around. In January, jobs added were 517,000, way more than analysts’ forecast of 187,000 job gains. Job additions were already healthy in the latter half of 2022, eventually leading to the unemployment rate declining to 3.4% in January, its lowest level since 1969.However, signs of strength in the labor market may lead to an uptick in consumer outlays, increasing price pressures, and compelling the Fed to raise interest rates through summer. Anyhow, the prices of indispensable commodities still remain elevated.The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, increased by 0.6% in January from December’s increase of 0.2%. What’s more, the PCE index jumped 5.4% annually in January from December’s reading of 5.3%, and all the readings came in higher than expected.Nonetheless, the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting showed that most of the policymakers want to raise interest rates soon to curb inflationary pressure. Market participants now expect the central bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in March in addition to May. This will push the policy rate to 5.36% by mid-summer, and many analysts expect the rate to remain at that level for 2023.But rate hikes do not necessarily bode well for the broader stock market as it impacts consumer spending habits, increases borrowing costs and hampers economic growth. Still, some stocks tend to gain from a hawkish interest rate environment. Notable among them are stocks from the financial sector, including banks, insurance, and asset management companies.Banks make more money when interest rates scale upward since the spread between what banks earn by investing and pay to customers increases. Similarly, rising interest rates increase the profit margins of insurance players and wealth management companies.Thus, we have selected three fundamentally solid stocks from the financial sector that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.State Street primarily performs its business through its principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank. Currently, State Street has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 7.4% over the past 60 days. STT’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.2%. Its shares are estimated to gain 8.9% next year.Everest Re Group writes property and casualty, reinsurance, and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda, and international markets. Presently, Everest Re Group has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 13.4% over the past 60 days. RE’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is almost 70%. Its shares are expected to advance 15.7% next year.AssetMark Financial provides wealth management and technology solutions to financial advisers and their clients. Currently, AssetMark Financial has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.2% over the past 60 days.

KRO logged a loss of $19.9 million or 18 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2022, against a profit of $31.6 million or 28 cents in the year-ago quarter. The loss per share figure was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents.The bottom line in the reported quarter was hurt by lower income from operations resulting from higher production costs and reduced sales volumes, partly offset by increased average titanium dioxide (TiO2) selling prices.Net sales fell 31% year over year to $342.4 million as reduced sales volumes in all markets more than offset higher average TiO2 selling prices.

TiO2 sales volumes fell 40% year over year.TiO2 segment loss was $15 million in the reported quarter compared with segment profit of $55.6 million a year ago. The downside was driven by lower sales volumes and higher production costs, including raw material and energy costs. These were partly offset by higher average TiO2 selling prices.Average TiO2 selling prices rose 15% year over year in the quarter.FY22 ResultsEarnings or full-year 2022 were 90 cents per share compared with 98 cents per share a year ago.

Long-term debt was $424.1 million, a roughly 6% year-over-year decline.OutlookKronos said that it is seeing improving demand in Europe and certain export markets driven by customer inventory replenishment following significant destocking in the fourth quarter 2022. However, it is witnessing sustained soft demand in North America in the first quarter of 2023. The company anticipates customer demand to gradually return during the first half of 2023, especially in Europe and export markets.At the beginning of 2023, KRO started a measured ramp up of production with the expectation of operating its facilities at full practical capacity by the end of the second quarter. While its selling prices remained stable at the beginning of 2023, the company expects prices to rise throughout the final three quarters of 2023 in response to increased production costs. Considering these factors, the company expects lower operating results for full-year 2023 on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of Kronos have lost 25.9% in the past year compared with a 12.9% rise of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksKronos Worldwide currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Steel Dynamics, Inc.

19,09f2f05d-0fcb-3136-94f2-aa6f27a4ae1a,NUE,2023-03-09,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Nucor (NUE) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005045.html,1678294805,STORY,['NUE'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Nucor (NUE), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nucor currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NUE that show why this steel company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For NUE, shares are up 9.75% over the past week while the Zacks Steel - Producers industry is up 4.7% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 2.41% compares favorably with the industry's 0.9% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Nucor have increased 14.56% over the past quarter, and have gained 35.92% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.77% and -3.48%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to NUE's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. NUE is currently averaging 1,471,005 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NUE.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NUE's consensus estimate, increasing from $12.76 to $14.12 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NUE is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nucor on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company purchases ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal from the general public, and industrial and commercial scrap metal sellers. A large bulk of volumes is for obsolete ferrous scrap grades used by Commercial Metals’ long product mills.The acquisition will boost Commercial Metals’ steelmaking operations' security and supply of competitively priced inputs.The financial terms of the acquisition have not yet been disclosed.Commercial Metals has been gaining from its acquisitions. As part of its strategic initiatives to boost growth, CMC has been active on the acquisition front.In November 2022, Commercial Metals completed the acquisition of a Galveston area metals recycling facility and related assets from Kodiak Resources, Inc. and Kodiak Properties, L.L.C.  The acquired operation annually processes approximately 55,000 tons of ferrous and non-ferrous materials, with the majority of volumes related to obsolete ferrous scrap grades consumed by Commercial Metals’ long product mills.  Similar to Roane, the buyout was expected to enhance the security and supply of competitively priced inputs to the company’s steelmaking operations.In September 2022, the company acquired Advanced Steel Recovery, LLC (ASR), a leading supplier of recycled ferrous metals in Southern California. This acquisition supports the company's strategic expansion plans in the Western United States.In April 2022, the company acquired Tensar Corporation, which added a highly-attractive growth platform to the company. It is expected to make Commercial Metals a unique provider of value-added reinforcement solutions for the domestic and international construction markets.After the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Nov 30, 2022), Commercial Metals’ total liquidity was $1.5 billion. The company’s strong liquidity, financial position and focus on reducing debt by strategic capital allocation approach will open additional acquisition opportunities.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.24 in first-quarter fiscal 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99. The bottom line rose 38.3% from the prior-year quarter’s earnings per share of $1.62. Net sales in the reported quarter were $2,227.3 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago quarter’s $1,981.8 million.

For decades, American chipmakers have aggressively invested in East Asian countries such as China and Taiwan to expand their manufacturing capacity. As a result, these companies now depend on global supply chains to conduct their business, which has become a cause for concern from a national security perspective at a time when tensions are rising between the U.S. and China.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with UNH. Click here to check it out. NUE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NUEPeter Lynch Chart of NUEMultibillion-dollar federal investments are expected to promote domestic chip manufacturing. Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department highlighted certain rules that need to be followed by chipmakers who receive federal funds. Some of the main conditions include sharing excess profits with the government, limiting shareholder distributions and prohibiting investments in certain foreign territories.In addition to these conditions, semiconductor companies are obliged to use American-made iron and steel to construct production facilities. As a result, federal investments made under the CHIPS Act are likely to help U.S. steel companies thrive, and Nucor Corp. (NYSE:NUE) seems well-positioned to benefit from this tailwind.The promising macroeconomic outlookAfter reaching a high in 2021, steel prices declined sharply through December 2022. So far this year, prices have recovered, aided by production disruptions in two mills run by Nucor and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD), a decline in mill utilization rates in the industry and a decrease in imports. The strong demand for steel coming from Turkey as the country rebuilds from the earthquake catastrophe has also pushed steel prices higher in recent weeks.Story continuesThe industry also benefits from favorable policy decisions, such as the Infrastructure Investment Act and the CHIPS Act. Despite a notable slowdown in residential construction activities as a result of rising interest rates, nonresidential construction spending remains strong, aided by billions of dollars injected by the government to support infrastructure development projects. According to data from the Federal Reserve, nonresidential construction spending declined in December, but quickly recovered in January, in line with expectations. Continued federal spending will keep the demand for steel at an elevated level, thereby helping steel manufacturers such as Nucor.The Biden administrations long-term goal of embracing renewable energy sources is another driver for steel producers as substantial investments are required to build the necessary infrastructure to support it. The success of the electric vehicle industry also depends on the availability of charging stations, and steel producers will have a major role to play in helping America transition into a future dominated by EVs.Investing for growthTo make the most of the promising long-term outlook, Nucor is investing aggressively to expand its scale. These investments include funds allocated to acquire companies and reinvestments in the business to expand the manufacturing scale. The company has already announced seven new projects for the next few years, including a West Virginia mill with advanced processing capabilities and a tube expansion at Gallatin. These investments are expected to result in efficiency gains, reduce conversion costs and lower greenhouse gas intensity. Nucors goal is to become a steel manufacturer and processor that caters to requirements across the steelmaking portfolio, and these investments are spread across different business segments.Financials, valuation and dividendNucors revenue grew 14% in 2022 on the back of a strong 2021, in which revenue grew by a staggering 81% aided by record-high steel prices. From just $722 million in pandemic-stricken 2020, Nucors net income swelled to over $7.6 billion in 2022, highlighting the eye-catching financial performance of the company in the last couple of years.On the back of this strong performance, Nucors stock has gained almost 500% since bottoming in March 2020. Still, the company is valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 14 currently, suggesting the massive run was fueled less by speculation and more by robust earnings. If earnings continue to grow as predicted in the next five years, the company will deliver handsome returns to investors even if the earnings multiple does not expand from current levels.Nucors attractive dividend is another reason to bet on the company. It aims to distribute at least 40% of its earnings to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, and the company is among an elite list of American companies with an extensive history of dividend distributions. The company has also increased its dividend in each of the last 49 years, which makes it one of just 64 companies in the S&amp;P 500 with a similar track record. Consistent buybacks, on the other hand, have helped Nucor to reduce its share count by more than 70 million since 2017, thereby allowing shareholders to get a larger piece of the pie without additional investment.Nucor does not have any debt maturing in 2023, 2024 or even in 2025; it only has to repay $1 billion in debt. The majority of the companys debt will mature beyond 2029, which leaves ample room for it to bring in cash flows from new investments.TakeawayAs one of the largest U.S. steelmakers, Nucor is well positioned to benefit from the Biden administrations massive infrastructure development projects, including the Infrastructure Investment Act and the CHIPS Act. The company seems fairly valued and pays a safe dividend that yields 1.1%. With prospects for steady earnings growth in the next five years, the stock could be a good bet for value investors.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.21 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.32%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.54% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.6%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.22%. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;CTO Realty (CTO) is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 8.45% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.54% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 14% over the past year. Check CTO Realty (CTO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.27 per share, Manulife Financial (MFC) has a dividend yield of 5.47%. This is compared to the Insurance - Life Insurance industry's yield of 0.05% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 10.55%. Check Manulife Financial (MFC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusBased in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 9.87%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.33 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.93%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.31%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.6%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.16%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 21%, meaning it paid out 21% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, UNM expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.61 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 6.44%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering PVH (PVH), which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry.This owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 12.77%.For the most recent quarter, PVH was expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share, but it reported $2.60 per share instead, representing a surprise of 22.07%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.01 per share, while it actually produced $2.08 per share, a surprise of 3.48%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor PVH, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PVH has an Earnings ESP of +2.84% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Both Thermo Fisher Scientific and Idexx Laboratories have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.14, while IDXX has a forward P/E of 49.70. We also note that TMO has a PEG ratio of 1.85. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IDXX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.76.Another notable valuation metric for TMO is its P/B ratio of 4.89. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IDXX has a P/B of 64.49.Based on these metrics and many more, TMO holds a Value grade of B, while IDXX has a Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth TMO and IDXX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that TMO is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TMO) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-120056957.html,1678276856,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Thermo Fisher Scientific is US$412 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityThermo Fisher Scientific's US$549 share price signals that it might be 33% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 58% higher than Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst price target of US$649Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.98bUS$9.33bUS$10.2bUS$10.2bUS$10.3bUS$10.5bUS$10.6bUS$10.8bUS$11.0bUS$11.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Est @ 0.97%Est @ 1.30%Est @ 1.53%Est @ 1.69%Est @ 1.81%Est @ 1.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$6.5kUS$8.0kUS$8.1kUS$7.5kUS$7.1kUS$6.6kUS$6.2kUS$5.9kUS$5.6kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$67bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$196bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$196b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$92bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$159b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$549, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.980. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

These instances greatly benefited key MedTech players in the Molecular Diagnostics business like Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD.Last month, BD received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV (human papillomavirus) Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test. The two most common Pap vials currently used by laboratories in the United States are the BD SurePath Liquid-based Pap Test vial and the Hologic ThinPrep Pap Test PreservCyt Solution vial.The same month, BD received the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a new molecular diagnostic combination test for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A + B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus — BD Respiratory Viral Panel assay for BD MAX System. The test, for use on the BD MAX Molecular Diagnostic System, is expected to aid in combatting illness in the current and future respiratory virus seasons.In January, BD received the FDA’s EUA for a molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Mpox virus detection — VIASURE Monkeypox Virus Real Time PCR Reagents for BD MAX System.The recent progress made by BD is expected to solidify its foothold in the global Molecular Diagnostics business, thereby boosting its overall Life Sciences segment.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global molecular diagnostics market is anticipated to reach $30.2 billion by 2027 from $23.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Factors like the emergence of new viruses, technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and the growing awareness of early disease diagnosis are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest developments are expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Story continuesComparison With PeersLast month, BD’s peer Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO announced the launch of its Applied Biosystems TrueMark STI Select Panel, a PCR research use-only test designed to detect Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium in one test, as well as RNase P, included as a human internal control.The same month, TMO announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results. Thermo Fisher saw robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments. In the fourth quarter, the company opened a state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA, to support its clinical research business and the increasing demand for analytical services to accelerate drug development.Another peer of BD, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. BIO, announced its fourth-quarter 2022 results last month. On a geographic basis, BIO experienced double-digit currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in the Americas and Asia, while Europe posted a more modest increase, primarily reflecting ongoing supply-chain constraints for diagnostic products.In November 2022, Bio-Rad announced an expanded portfolio of independent quality controls products, now including InteliQ and Liquichek compact vials, for the Abbott Alinity ci-series integrated clinical chemistry and immunoassay testing instruments.Another renowned name in the PCR space and BD’s peer, Qiagen N.V. QGEN, announced the certification of QuantiFERON-TB (tuberculosis) Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) under the European Union’s In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) last month. QFT-Plus, endorsed by the WHO, aids in the indirect detection of the bacteria that causes TB. The IVDR certification of QFT-Plus follows the QIAGEN ipsogen JAK2 RGQ PCR Kit, as well as the NeuMoDx Systems and reagents, which gained IVDR CE-marking in late 2022.The same month, QGEN announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results. Ongoing double-digit sales growth in Qiagen’s non-COVID product portfolio, a high level of profitability and strong cash flow were the major upsides. The QIAcuity digital PCR system delivered solid double-digit constant exchange rate (CER) growth for 2022, supported by the launch of the latest assays for biopharma applications. Further, QuantiFERON-TB registered solid double-digit CER growth in 2022, led by the continued conversion of the latent TB market from the traditional skin test.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But things were getting very dangerous and there was a lot of unrest due to the political situation,"" said Roman, who met his future wife, Frances, in 2007 while studying English at Xavier University in Cincinnati between practicing law and opening his businesses.""She followed me back to Venezuela and then eventually returned to Cincinnati to find a job and scope out possibilities for us,"" he said. ""We were engaged at that time and had big decisions to make.""While he worked 18-hour days at the pet store and coffee shop, Roman said, she found a job in Cincinnati and things fell into place in the U.S. much more quickly than expected. It was time to decide where to live long-term.""I called my dad and had a conversation about us moving to America permanently,"" Roman said. ""I expected him to ask me to stay, but he suggested we leave and and look for better things.""Six months later, Roman and his dog, Zeus, boarded a plane and traveled for two days, finally landing in Cincinnati with two bags, a backpack, $3,000 in cash and $1,000 in credit.""The official exchange rate was controlled by the government so that was all they allowed me to bring,"" he said. ""I didn't know how long the credit card would work so Frances picked me up from the airport and we headed straight to Ikea and loaded up the car so we could furnish our apartment and begin building our life.""Roman immediately took care of his U.S. residency and green card paperwork. In October 2015, he applied for his first job at U.S. Bank.Story continues""The branch manager said I was overqualified but encouraged me to apply and get to know the company until additional opportunities opened up,"" he said.Roman said it was challenging to start from zero.""I talked to my wife and she asked me if I wanted to start a career or did I just want a job?"" Roman knew his answer so, at 33, he took the position as a branch teller. In less than a year he received his first promotion, followed within a few months by an offer to serve as an assistant branch manager. In 2018, he applied for the branch manager position at the Route 4 location in Fairfield, north of Cincinnati, where he still works today and continues to grow with leadership opportunities in his district.""When I was applying for different positions, I didn't know much about banking and started reading about the company,"" Roman said. ""I could tell it was a really good company compared to other financial institutions and liked that it had earned awards and was noted for its ethics over the years. It was a dream my family had - the opportunity to be a part of the corporate American dream.""District Manager Joe Albers said, ""Cesar is a very charismatic and high energy leader. He works hard to make sure his team and his clients are taken care of. He is deeply committed to the development of his staff and the development of the Hispanic community in Cincinnati.""In 2022, Roman and his branch team, who are all from different parts of Central and South America, earned top performer awards and led U.S. Bank branch teams in various categories.""A big part of our success is that, when I took over the location, I was aware that there was a Latino population with whom I knew we could make a difference,"" Roman said. ""We were able to strategize, hire the right people, and offer valuable products and services to our community. Today, people drive up to an hour to see us because we can speak their language and have the knowledge to help them understand and reach their financial goals.""Albers added, ""For many customers, this is their first experience with banking in the U.S. They are introduced to our checking products, many are put on a savings plan and introduced to credit through our secured credit card products. But this is just the banking side of things. Cesar has personally helped many customers to help put them on the path to citizenship.""Roman said he and his team are excited about the future.""Our goals keep growing and we're excited.

CF recently signed a memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) with South Korean chemical company, Lotte Chemical Corporation to explore a joint U.S.-based clean ammonia project. The MoU will also include long-term clean ammonia offtake into South Korea.The MOU will allow the companies to evaluate the joint development of and investment in a greenfield clean ammonia production facility in the United States, including at CF Industries’ Blue Point Complex in Louisiana. The prospective ammonia production facility would leverage carbon capture and sequestration technologies to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the production process of ammonia to a level that meets or surpasses South Korea’s clean ammonia requirements.The companies will also measure expected clean ammonia demand in South Korea for power generation, bunkering and other sectors, factoring in the regulatory and policy requirements as well as safety and environmental considerations. This is expected to confirm the scale of long-term offtake volume expectations for a potential clean ammonia facility.Lotte Chemical plans to produce and sell 1.2 million tons of clean hydrogen by investing a total of 6 trillion won by 2030. Clean ammonia is seen as a safe and efficient hydrogen carrier and storage mechanism.CF Industries, which is among the prominent players in the fertilizers space along with Nutrien Ltd. NTR, The Mosaic Company MOS and Intrepid Potash, Inc. IPI, has advanced projects to decarbonize its ammonia production network and position it to deliver a substantial volume of clean ammonia within the next few years.The company is constructing a CO2 dehydration and compression facility at its Donaldsonville Complex to allow the capture and permanent sequestration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 annually, starting in 2025. CF has also started a front-end engineering and design study to build a greenfield clean ammonia facility utilizing carbon capture and sequestration at its Blue Point Complex. It is also constructing North America’s first commercial scale green ammonia capacity at the Donaldsonville Complex, which would allow up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia production starting in 2024.CF Industries’ earnings of $4.35 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.13. Net sales rose around 3% year over year to $2,608 million, but trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,814.2 million. The top line was mainly driven by higher prices across the company’s most segments due to disruption in the global supply chain of fertilizers, resulting from higher global energy costs, reduced operating rates globally and geopolitical factors.CF industries, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects global nitrogen prices to gain support from abundant agricultural demand. The company also expects the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to remain tight into 2025, supported by agricultural-led demand and persistently high energy prices in Europe and Asia.Demand for nitrogen continues to be driven by the need to replenish global grains stocks, per the company. CF believes that it will take at least two years for harvests to fully replenish global grain stocks, which will support strong grain plantings aiding nitrogen applications further.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CF) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-inc-cf-140002877.html,1678197602,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +0% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $2.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -22%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.09 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -41.9%. This estimate has changed -24.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.49 indicates a change of -25.7% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CF.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For CF, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -30.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $7.98 billion and $6.63 billion estimates indicate -28.6% and -16.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.7%. EPS of $4.35 for the same period compares with $3.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.33%. The EPS surprise was +5.33%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fundamentally, the needs associated with the agricultural industry largely benefit from inelasticity. That is, no matter what’s going on with the economy, civilizations need access to sustenance.Specifically, one of the biggest (albeit cynical) catalysts for agriculture stocks to buy centers on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since both nations represent major producers of wheat, grain production will likely be reduced significantly. Unfortunately, that’s not the only factor to consider. Even Mother Nature seems upset these days.With damaging winter wheat crop prospects impacting areas from Argentina to southern Europe and from the U.S. to North Africa, the supply of core goods will probably be strained. Again, it’s not a holistically uplifting narrative. However, the wildness of the events associated with the new normal may keep these agriculture stocks running for a while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTTCToro$113.83FMCFMC Corp.$128.40DEDeere$430.28ANDEAndersons$46.32NTRNutrien$82.81CFCF Industries$86.16BGBunge$98.77Toro (TTC)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comBased in Bloomington, Minnesota, Toro (NYSE:TTC) designs, manufactures, and markets lawnmowers, snow blowers, and irrigation system supplies for commercial and residential, agricultural, and public sector use. Presently, the company commands a market capitalization of $11.6 billion. Since the start of the year, TTC slipped by 2%. However, in the trailing year, shares gained over 14%.Financially, Toro’s greatest strengths lie in its operational attributes. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 13.8%, outpacing over 77% of the competition. On the bottom line, the company features a net margin of 9.82%, above 72.54% of the industry.To be fair, it’s not that much of a source of passive income, carrying a forward yield of only 1.23%. However, Toro’s payout ratio stands at 24.65%, making it very sustainable. As well, the company is on a 19-year streak for consecutive annual dividend increases. Interestingly, Wall Street analysts peg TTC as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $123, implying 11% upside potential. Therefore, it’s a solid idea for agriculture stocks to buy.Story continuesFMC Corp (FMC)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, FMC Corp (NYSE:FMC) is an agricultural sciences company that advances farming through innovative and sustainable crop protection technologies, per its website. At the moment, FMC carries a market cap of $16 billion. Since the January opener, FMC gained over 2%. And in the trailing year, it’s up over 7%.As with Toro above, FMC’s greatest strengths lie in its operations. In particular, its three-year book growth rate stands at 11.2%, outpacing 62.56% of its peers. On the bottom line, the company features a net margin of 12.69%, above 72.81% of the underlying sector. For dividend lovers, FMC rates a tad bit more generous than Toro, though not by much. Its forward yield sits at 1.81%. However, the company’s payout ratio pings at just under 26%, indicating a sustainable yield.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg FMC as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $144.30, implying nearly 13% upside potential. Again, it makes for a solid idea for agriculture stocks to buy.Deere (DE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA manufacturer of agricultural equipment, Deere (NYSE:DE) is an indirect play among agriculture stocks to buy. However, as demand in the space picks up, Deere could be a natural beneficiary. Presently, the company commands a market cap of $124.38 billion. Since the January opener, DE slipped by 1%. However, in the trailing year, shares gained nearly 12% of equity value.As with other agriculture stocks to buy, Deere rates best in the operational department. However, it does make for objectively solid value. Presently, DE’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 0.97 times, below the sector median PEG of 1.19. For operations, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.7%, outrunning 78% of the field. In terms of net margin, it posted 14.9%, blowing past nearly 92% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg DE as a consensus moderate buy.

Currently, the enterprise features a market cap of $1.54 billion. Since the Jan. opener, ANDE gained almost 36% of its equity value.

As a discount to earnings, Andersons ranks better than 68.53% of its peers. Moreover, ANDE trades at a trailing sales multiple of 0.09. This stat ranks better than 92% of the industry.Similar to other direct agriculture stocks to buy, Andersons doesn’t deliver much in the way of passive income. Its forward yield sits at 1.61%. However, just like the others, its payout ratio is 21.45%, indicating sustainability. Also, the company features 25 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg ANDE as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $52.50, implying 14% upside potential.Nutrien (NTR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA Canadian fertilizer company, Nutrien (NYSE:NTR) is the largest producer of potash and the third-largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world, per its public profile.

Since the January opener, NTR gained almost 10% of its equity value.Still, in the trailing year, NTR dropped almost 11%, possibly making it undervalued.

Also, its PEG ratio sits at 0.11 times, lower than over 96% of sector players. One notable feature of NTR compared to other agriculture stocks to buy focuses on passive income. Nutrien carries a forward yield of 2.7, very close to the sector average of 2.82%. And just like the other enterprises, Nutrien features a low payout ratio of 25.27%.Finally, covering analysts peg NTR as a consensus moderate buy.

Further, CF trades at a forward multiple of 6.99, lower than 61.9% of the field.As for the passive income department, it could use some work. CF carries a forward yield of 1.88%; it’s not great but not terrible either. Plus, the company features an ultra-low payout ratio of 18.71%. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg CF as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $104.43, implying over 19% upside potential. Thus, it could be a growth opportunity among agriculture stocks to buy.Bunge (BG)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) focuses on the international soybean export industry. As well, it’s involved in food processing, grain trading, and fertilizer. Presently, the company carries a market cap of $14.27 billion. Since the Jan. opener, BG dipped almost half a percent. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 12% of equity value.Again, bargain hunters will appreciate the value proposition that Bunge brings to the table. Right now, the market prices BG at a trailing multiple of 9.05. As a discount to earnings, Bunge ranks better than 76.36% of the competition. Further, BG trades hands at 8.04-times forward earnings, which sits well south of the industry median of 16.97 times. Aside from the discount, Bunge provides some decent passive income with a forward yield of 2.63%. As well, the company’s payout ratio sits at 22.1%, indicating a sustainable yield.Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $123, implying over 29% upside potential.

These include IMPACT for our LGBTQ+ community and their allies, LEAD for our partners from Asian and Pacific Island (API) heritages; RISE2 for our Black and African American employee-partners; TODOS for our Hispanic and Latin employee-partners; VALOR for our veteran and military-affiliated employee-partners; and WAVE for our female employee-partners.IMPACT and LEAD were created in 2022 in response to our company's growing employee-partner populations and their appetite for group-based, collaborative development resources.PBRGs provide members with outlets to lend their voices and perspectives, and with spaces where they can share experiences and support one another. They also provide a platform for management to hear from our employee-partners directly about the issues that matter most to them. It's a two-way dialogue that we believe benefits everyone.CAREER DEVELOPMENTOur PBRG missions not only align with our business objectives and help us secure continued competitiveness, but also provide a platform for our employee-partners to grow and connect with partners from similar backgrounds.While our mentor opportunities focus on skill- and job-based criteria, our PBRGs are based on common backgrounds and shared experiences. We also believe that the PBRGs give our employee-partners a louder voice, additional leadership opportunities, and greater access to management.PBRG leadership, past and present, is active and visible throughout our organization. Employee-partners who accept PBRG leadership roles - including president, vice president, and committee assignments - are actively engaged with a broad cross-section of our company, from the field all the way up to the executive offices. Many of our PBRGs also have field chapters that help bring the goals and ambitions of formalized development to employee-partners throughout the United States and Canada. This helps to promote stronger connections to our corporate development strategy and goals, and makes connections between employee-partners across our company who may not otherwise have the chance to cross paths.Story continuesOur PBRGs have gained national attention.

46,707ff068-1b89-34bc-8bb1-e1e4d7d18f72,CTAS,2023-03-09,Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Ticks All The Boxes When It Comes To Earnings Growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-nasdaq-ctas-ticks-boxes-180109530.html,1678125669,STORY,['CTAS'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Cintas How Quickly Is Cintas Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Cintas grew its EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of Cintas' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Cintas achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 13% to US$8.4b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Cintas' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Cintas Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$45b company like Cintas. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$6.7b. That equates to 15% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Very encouraging.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Cintas, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.Cintas offered total compensation worth US$7.8m to its CEO in the year to May 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Cintas Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Cintas is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Cintas, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Cintas that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

48,b358851e-3f57-3268-8187-c7ba9f2a8aaf,EW,2023-03-09,Abbott (ABT) Makes Progress in the TAVI Space With Navitor,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-abt-makes-progress-tavi-144502766.html,1678200302,STORY,"['EW', 'BSX', 'MDT']","[Abbott ABT recently announced significant progress with Navitor, the company’s latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system. The company announced late-breaking data for Navitor during presentations at the annual Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) meeting held in Washington, D.C. (Feb 25-28, 2023).Results from this study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery.More About the StudyFollowing the development of Abbott's next-generation TAVI system, the company launched the PORTICO NG (Next Generation) study. This prospective, multicenter, international, single-arm trial supports the FDA approval of the Navitor TAVI system that was received back in January 2023.PORTICO NG specifically demonstrates the safety of the Navitor TAVI system and its effectiveness in minimizing blood leakage around the valve implant.In this regard, we note that the Navitor TAVI system, the latest addition to the company's comprehensive transcatheter structural heart portfolio, offers less-invasive treatment options for some of the most common and serious heart diseases.Navitor’s unique fabric cuff (NaviSeal) is expected to reduce or eliminate the backflow of blood around the valve frame, known as the paravalvular leak. Additionally, the new device is the only self-expanding TAVI system with leaflets within the native valve. This design is expected to aid in improving access to coronary arteries to facilitate future procedures for treating coronary artery disease.The Amplatzer Amulet LAA UpdateAbbott also showcased late-breaking data for the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder at the annual CRT meeting. This study highlights the benefits of this device's immediate and complete closure of the LAA for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) at risk of stroke.According to the company, the Amulet IDE trial’s findings demonstrated that the Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder with dual-seal technology (consisting of a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to seal off the opening into the LAA) had fewer unresolved, severe peri-device leaks (PDLs), where blood leaks around the implant, compared to Boston Scientific's BSX Watchman‡ device that has a single component to close the LAA.Story continuesPer Abbott, severe PDLs with Amulet were less commonly associated with adverse events and deaths than BSX’s Watchman.Competitive Niche in Transcatheter Aortic Valve SpacePer a report by Allied Market Research, the global TAVI market was valued at $4,559 million in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $16,937 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 14%. Factors like the increase in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, rise in demand for various TAVI procedures and rise in the elderly population are likely to drive the market.Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device sales grew 22% organically in the last-reported fourth quarter of 2022. Strong utilization in the United States was supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, the company completed the enrollment of the CHAMPION-AF trial ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond.Edwards Lifesciences EW, within TAVR in 2022, received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. The company continued to advance enrollment in the PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from the Alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce Edwards Lifesciences’ long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions.Medtronic MDT, at the same time, despite healthcare staffing challenges, is seeing great physician reception for the company’s Evolut FX system, which just completed its full quarter launch in the United States. Evolut FX combines industry-leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. In addition, data presented at PCR London Valves showed that Evolut FX’s Commissure alignment has improved significantly, which is important for coronary access and valve hemodynamics. Medtronic is currently working to seek Evolut FX’s approval in the Japanese and European markets.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ABT recently presented late-breaking data from the Landmark COAPT trial for MitraClip, demonstrating the long-term benefits of the device in patients fighting heart failure. The data were presented at the American College of Cardiology's 72nd Annual Scientific Session together with the World Congress of Cardiology organized in New Orleans between March 4-6, 2023.The recent development will fortify Abbott’s Structural Heart’s business.Study DetailsIn the COAPT trial, symptomatic heart failure patients with severe secondary MR —  a condition in which a leaky valve caused by problems affecting other areas of the heart allows blood to flow back through the mitral valve — were evaluated with MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy or guideline-directed medical therapy alone.The five-year results from the landmark COAPT trial demonstrated that MitraClip is safe, effective and can reduce hospitalizations while improving survival for heart failure patients with severe secondary (or functional) MR.Benefits of Favorable ResultsWith about two decades of clinical experience in transcatheter mitral repair, Abbott's MitraClip paved the way for advancement in supporting people with mitral regurgitation, offering an alternative to surgery for patients who often need treatment to survive.These five-year COAPT results prove that MitraClip is safe and effective at treating secondary MR in advanced heart failure patients, minimizing hospitalizations and helping patients live longer.Per Abbott’s management, these results indicate that MitraClip plays a vital role in enhancing the symptoms of people with this serious heart condition and getting them back to living their fullest lives.Industry ProspectsPer a recent Allied Market Research market, the global structural heart devices market is expected to be worth $12.1 million by 2022, at a CAGR of 10.5%. Given the rising rate of cardiac ailments and the critical need to detect them, we believe Abbott is well-positioned to cash in on the opportunities in this market.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsThis month, Abbott presented late-breaking data for the TriClip transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) system –a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device developed specifically for tricuspid heart valve repair. The TRILUMINATE Pivotal study assesses the superiority of TriClip compared to medical therapy in treating patients with severe, symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) at intermediate or greater risk for open-heart surgery.Last month, Abbott presented late-breaking data for its newest-generation Navitor transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system. The study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at high or greater risk for open-heart surgery. The company also demonstrated late-breaking data for the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder that continue to reflect the benefits of this device's immediate and complete closure of the LAA – a differentiator from competing therapies – for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) at risk of stroke.Developments Within PeersA few other companies like Medtronic plc MDT, Edwards Lifesciences, Inc. EW and Boston Scientific, Inc. BSX are also progressing well within the Heart segment.In February 2023, Medtronic announced the relaunch of its Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV) System – a minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease patients with native or surgically repaired right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Harmony TPV was designed to treat patients with RVOT anomalies who develop severe pulmonary valve regurgitation, a condition where blood leaks back into the right lower chamber of the heart after being pumped into the lungs.In November 2022, Edwards Lifesciences presented one-year results on patients treated in the single-arm, prospective, global, multi-center TRISCEND study of the company’s EVOQUE transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement system which demonstrated favorable safety, efficacy and quality-of-life outcomes.  The one-year outcomes demonstrated high survival and high freedom from heart failure hospitalization.In November 2022, Boston Scientific presented the first results from the ACURATE neo2 Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study evaluating the performance of the ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System. These trial data confirmed the success of meaningful and differentiated enhancements included in the design of the ACURATE neo2 valve, from low rates of PVL and first-time pacemaker implantation to excellent hemodynamic performance and high rates of procedural success and safety.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PRNewsFoto/Edwards Lifesciences Corporation)AS MortalityIn the study, ""Untreated Aortic Stenosis Mortality by Diagnosis Severity: Results from a Large Real-World Dataset,"" Philippe Généreux, M.D., director of the structural heart program at the Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute at Morristown Medical Center, and colleagues analyzed more than 1.6 million echocardiograms from 24 U.S. hospitals in the egnite, Inc., cardiovascular management database.1,2  The study found that, for the almost 600,000 patients with AS severity assessment available, all degrees of untreated AS severity were associated with increased mortality risk. For example, the mean 2-year all-cause mortality for moderate untreated AS was ~20%, approaching the rate of those with severe AS.""The main finding of this analysis is that the severity of AS may be underrecognized and undertreated, leading to unnecessary and preventable death among our patients,"" Généreux said. ""Our study of real-world data highlights the challenges in properly determining the severity of AS by echocardiogram and underlines the high mortality rate associated with a milder degree of AS severity, such as mild and moderate, than previously suspected.  Both point to the importance of continued study into the potential benefit of earlier intervention among patients with AS.""TAVR 10-Year Re-interventionAn analysis of Medicare data, led by Suzanne J. Baron, M.D., MSc, an interventional and structural cardiologist in Boston, Mass., showed a very low rate of re-intervention after TAVR out to 10 years.  Among 230,644 patients treated with transfemoral and transapical TAVR between 2011 and 2021, only 1,880 underwent a valvular re-intervention.  When the competing risk of death was considered, this translated to a 1.63% rate of re-intervention overall.  Additionally, rates of re-intervention appear to be decreasing with the introduction of next-generation technologies.Story continues""The observed, sustained low re-intervention rates as well as the decrease in re-interventions with advanced technology are particularly impactful and provide valuable input into the decision making of heart teams and patients in evaluating TAVR as a treatment option, particularly as younger patients are being treated,"" Baron said.   ""Certainly, more data are needed, but this is definitely reassuring.""""These data highlight the urgency in studying the right time to intervene in AS disease progression to achieve the best outcome for the patient, and we look forward to additional data that will come from the PROGRESS and EARLY TAVR trials currently underway,"" said Larry Wood, corporate vice president and group president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart, Edwards Lifesciences. ""Through a potentially outdated treatment paradigm, some patients may be incurring needless cardiac damage or mortality when a proven therapy is available.""1 egnite's CardioCare software was incubated at Edwards Lifesciences. 2Dr. Généreux is a paid consultant for Edwards Lifesciences.About Edwards LifesciencesEdwards Lifesciences is the global leader of patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.

Walmart's margins have followed a similar pattern as it tries to keep prices low for consumers, and maintain traffic for its stores.Kroger Co's margins also rose sharply in the pandemic, as food prices have spiked.P&amp;G, Kroger and Walmart did not immediately return requests for comment.P&amp;G executives said at an industry conference last month that as inflation continues, it becomes harder to increase prices.Executives at Walmart said last month inflation in food and consumables has persisted, with food inflation higher than what they thought it would be.U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative David Cicilline have taken companies to task over price hikes on items shoppers buy every day.The situation is not unique to the United States, with data shared at a recent European Central Bank retreat showing companies there are profiting from high inflation.""Corporate profits and higher margins have been a key driver of inflation and as they start to ease we will see lower prices in real life,"" said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative. ""What works going up, works coming down. If we see margins ease, companies bring prices down, we'll see lower inflation.""Story continuesSome manufacturers of household goods are easing price hikes. Ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co, Clorox Co and PepsiCo Inc have indicated they are pressing pause on further raising prices.Clorox declined to comment, while Kraft Heinz and Pepsico did not immediately return a request for comment.P&amp;G and Stouffer's frozen meal maker Nestle SA have said they are planning to continue increasing prices, even as shoppers are buying less and trimming their budgets. Nestle did not immediately return a request for comment.Former Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said in the fall that retail margins - a measure of the price chains charge for a product compared to what they paid for it - have risen ""significantly more"" than wages for the typical store associate.Lowering those margins could help reduce inflation pressures in consumer goods, she said.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)]"

This will be the company's third location there, with plans to open two more units this fiscal year. The bottom line: Costco seems serious about taking on Walmart's Sam's Club, which already has almost 40 stores in China.Costco's new warehouse will be in Shanghai's Pudong, near the Disneyland Resort. Walmart's (WMT) Sam's Club has had a presence in China since 1996. It opened #39 last fall, demonstrating its ""commitment to accelerating and deepening its growth throughout China,"" it said in at statement at the time.CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram thinks there is room for both.""The market is massive. Obviously, the Chinese economy is huge, so I think there's there's room for multiple competitors to be successful in China, so regardless of Sam's Clubs' growth strategy there, I think Costco will do well,"" he said.Costco launched its first physical location in China back in 2019, which proved successful when approximately 200,000 members signed up in the first few months, surpassing its goal of 100,000. Costco’s second location then opened in 2021in Suzhou, a city west of Shanghai.The location opening this week in Shanghai's Pudong already has more than 80,000 members signed up, according to the Global Times.Now as it opens more locations in China, Costco executives seem aware that membership signups won't be as many as that initial blowout response.""We signed up so many members in those first two warehouses,"" SVP Bob Nelson said In a call with investors following Costco’s fiscal Q3 2022, which ended March 31, 2022. He said with additional locations, ""It's going to change the dynamics a little bit.”Costco's fourth and fifth locations will be in Yinzhou, a district in the city of Ningbo, per its website.In total, Costco touts 848 warehouses, including 584 in the United States, plus 264 international locations. Last quarter, Costco’s international business saw same-store sales up 3.8%.Story continuesWalmart, on the other hand, has 332 wholesale club locations internationally with its largest wholesale presence in Mexico (166 units). In Walmart's Q4 results, the company reported international same-store sales up 2.1%, noting ""Walmex [Walmart in Mexico], China, and Canada led the way.""This membership-only model gives an edge over retailers. In recent years, other retailers are seeing significant pullback in the market like Carrefour along with its parent company in China, Suning.com, which seems to be closing its doors. “If you're just a regular retailer, like a big-box retailer, you probably won't do that well in China, because that's such a mature market,” Sundaram said. CFRA holds a hold rating and $480 price target on shares of Costco, and a buy rating on shares of Walmart, along with a price target of $160.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.A 'slow and methodical approach'?Slow and steady wins the race? Maybe.Sundaram said the measured approach that Costco used to enter the Chinese market was “smart.” Five years before it opened its first physical location there, it started introducing itself with e-commerce on sites like JD.com (JD) and a division of Alibaba (BABA) called Tmall.E-commerce “was a way for them to really understand the Chinese consumer and learn...their shopping habits.""Sundaram mentioned a few risks too. They include China's regulatory environment, geopolitical issues following the U.S.-China trade war, and local competitors potentially having a better pulse on the consumer.“There's this massive addressable market in China, but it comes with a lot of risks. That's why it makes sense to really test out the waters before making a huge upfront investment in China, which is why Costco, essentially, have been really slow and methodical in their approach to growth in China.""Can Sam's top this frenzy? People try to get a roast chicken at the first Costco outlet in China, on the stores opening day in Shanghai on August 27, 2019. (Photo HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images)Why now is a good time for Costco to expand in ChinaAnd 2023 might be the right time to boost its presence in China, the problems with the U.S, aside.This competition of wholesale retailers comes as the People's Republic expects GDP to rise around 5% this year, which means Chinese consumers may have more cash in hand. That, among other reasons, is why CFRA analyst Sundaram believes it's a good time for Costco to expand.For one thing, the Chinese upper middle class is experiencing a “rapid rise"" and consumers are intrigued by the concept of member-only shopping. “It seems as if the Chinese consumer is very receptive to these membership-only models, which I don't think that would have been the case, maybe, 10 to 15 years ago,” Sundaram said.According to the 2023 McKinsey China Consumer Report, the upper-middle class is seeing double-digit growth and high-income households are ""powering robust consumption growth.""Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.The retail business is simple — buy from wholesalers, sell to consumers, pocket the difference.In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another.At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more.And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic.In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed.As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right.Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season.Restocking Schwinn Bicycles at Dicks Sporting Goods store, shortages of bicycles due to increased ridership during Covid 19 pandemic, Queens, New York.

We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO.Story continuesDick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned.""Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years.Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year.""""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels.""McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year.""The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels.But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve.""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach.""The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond.""Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.What to Watch TodayEconomyMBA Mortgage ApplicationsADP Employment Report, FebruaryBalance of Trade, JanuaryJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, JanuaryFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before House Financial Services CommitteeFederal Reserve Beige BookEarningsCampbell Soup (CPB); Brown-Forman (BF-B); Korn/Ferry (KFY); MongoDB (MDB); The Children's Place (PLCE); United Natural Foods (UNFI)Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(NYSE:JWN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 2, 2023Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Nordstrom Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. . As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I'll turn the call over to Sara Penner, Manager of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may now begin.Sara Penner: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed in the investor relations section on nordstrom.com. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide with our Safe Harbor language. As a reminder, we are here today to discuss our business and fourth quarter performance, and we will not be taking questions on other matters. Participating in today's call are Erik Nordstrom, Chief Executive Officer, Pete Nordstrom, President and Chief Brand Officer, and Michael Maher, interim Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a business update and discuss the company's fourth quarter performance. And now I'll turn the call over to Erik.Erik Nordstrom: Thank you, Sara, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. For the fourth quarter, we delivered net sales of $4.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.74. Looking back on the fiscal year, revenue increased 5% from 2021, and adjusted EBIT margin was in line with last year at 3.3%. We saw customers starting to pull back in late June, primarily in Nordstrom Rack, and this trend continued through the holiday season. Across both banners the softening trend was more pronounced in customers with lower income profiles. Given the uncertain environment we are executing with agility, we took action starting in Q3 to clear excess inventory and optimize our product mix. As a result, we are now in a much healthier position with inventory levels down 15% from last year and in line with 2019 levels.Story continuesWell, this was the right strategy to better position our inventory levels for 2023, we implemented more markdowns than we had initially planned to achieve our goal. This was compounded by the softening trend, excess inventory levels and promotional intensity in our sector. As a result, our margins were lower than expected in the fourth quarter. Despite this, I'm pleased that our supply chain initiatives delivered efficiency and lower per unit costs in Q4, resulting in more than 200 basis points of SG&amp;A rate improvement even with lower sales leverage and ongoing inflationary pressures. At the same time, we remain committed to driving more profitable long-term growth. We are looking across our business and operations with this clear mindset to ensure we are deploying our financial resources and talent against the opportunities where we are best positioned to win in the medium and long term.With this in mind, we have decided to wind down our Canadian business over the next few months to simplify our operations and increase our focus on our core U.S. business. We entered Canada in 2014 because we believed it presented a compelling opportunity, and we are grateful for the many customer relationships we have built over the years. Despite our team's best efforts, including multiple initiatives to improve our outcomes, our Canadian business has not been profitable. The impact from COVID drove further losses with no realistic path to sustainable profitability. Canada accounts for less than 3% of our total sales, and we believe we will benefit from a sharper focus on our U.S. business. Michael will provide more detail on the onetime charges related to this decision and the impact on our sales and profitability going forward.While we are confident in our decision, it was a difficult one to make, and we recognize the personal impact on our employees. We are committed to treating our Canadian employees with fairness and respect. We are establishing an employee trust that will provide additional benefits for employees during the wind down period. I have the deepest appreciation for the talent and passion of our great team in Canada. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication to customers and the service they have provided over the years. More than ever, I believe Nordstrom is uniquely positioned to meet the changing needs of our customers. With our two powerful interconnected brands, the breadth of our products, styles and prices, and most of all, our unwavering passion for customer service, we have a durable foundation for growth.We are taking clear actions in 2023 to expand market share and improve our profitability. It starts with our loyal customer base, our greatest asset. We acquired approximately 10 million new customers in 2022 and added 2.5 million new Nordy Club members. We are committed to building on these successes, while delivering on our legacy of service across physical stores and digitally as the customer experience continues to evolve to be even more omnichannel. This is critical to driving engagement and attracting more customers. In addition to improving the customer experience, we are focused on three specific priorities to drive better financial performance in 2023. one, improving Nordstrom Rack performance. two, increasing our inventory productivity; and three, continuing to advance our supply chain optimization initiatives.I'll address each of these briefly, then Pete will go into more depth on some of our initiatives in support of these priorities. Starting with Nordstrom Rack. Sales in Q4 declined 8% versus last year as we saw consumers pull back spending. We estimate that a little over half of the decrease was driven by specific actions we took to improve profitability, namely eliminating costly Rack store-based order fulfillment and raising the minimum order amount to receive free ship-to-store delivery on nordstromrack.com. These actions reduced order cancellations, simplified Rack operations and improved profitability, but negatively impacted top line growth at the Rack. We also cleared out older and unproductive inventory giving us increased open-to-buy and therefore, greater flexibility to improve our merchandise assortment as we enter 2023.We are committed to improving both our top and bottom line performance at Nordstrom Rack in three ways. First and most importantly, we are prioritizing 100 nationally recognized strategic brands to help us drive sales and grow market share. Simply put, we know we win with customers at the Rack when we deliver great brands at great prices. We believe strong brand recognition drives outsized customer engagement, and these brands are proven performers many of which are not widely available in the off-price space. By increasing inventory turns at the Rack, we can increase the flow of these great brands and give customers newness each time they visit us. Second, we are expanding our reach and convenience for customers by opening 20 new Rack stores this year.Rack stores continue to be our largest source of new customer acquisition, accounting for more than 40% of newly acquired customers in 2022. Our Rack store fleet is underpenetrated, and we have an opportunity to attract more customers and drive profitable growth through a proven model as we expand our reach with more new stores. Third, we will drive greater engagement and higher profitability at nordstromrack.com. Our digital capabilities are unique in the off-price space, and we see opportunities to leverage our digital assets to increase engagement with our Rack customers. We will also continue to optimize the operational model for improved profitability as we did by discontinuing store-based fulfillment of nordstromrack.com orders. Moving now to our second priority for 2023, inventory productivity.Better inventory discipline across our operation provides customers with relevant and new assortments from the world's best brands. We also have a significant opportunity to improve our earnings and returns on invested capital through increased productivity from our merchandise inventory, our largest annual investment. The substantial disruptions and volatility in our business over the past three years had a significant impact on our inventory management and outcomes, including buy plans, receipt flows, stock levels, markdowns and turns. As supply chains have stabilized, we have an opportunity to return to pre-pandemic norms across these elements of our inventory management. Finally, let's turn to our third priority of supply chain optimization.We made great progress in 2022 on our supply chain initiatives, which drove improvement in our SG&amp;A rate despite lower sales leverage and continued inflationary pressure. Pete will provide highlights from our work in 2022. This year, we will build on our momentum to further improve the customer experience while driving greater expense efficiency. We're continuing to scale our West Coast omnichannel center, and we are building productivity across our network. Improvements in inventory turns and flow also continue to help reduce supply chain costs. The past three years have been the most challenging and unpredictable for our industry more than a generation. We are incredibly proud of the way our people navigated the unprecedented circumstances, while remaining true to our core values.As we enter 2023, we are ready to move forward. We have a clear set of priorities that we expect will drive improved performance in the near term while positioning us for longer-term profitable growth. We have made difficult decisions to increase our focus on executing against those priorities in our core business. We have a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows, and we remain committed to putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.Pete Nordstrom: Thanks, Erik, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to talk about our merchandise performance during the fourth quarter, then follow up with highlights from the work streams under each of the three focus areas Erik discussed, starting with merchandise performance. We prioritize getting to healthy inventory levels by year-end and taking additional markdowns to do so impacted our results in most categories. That said, we saw areas of strength in the quarter. we were pleased to see strength in men's apparel, which was up versus last year and at 2019 levels, particularly in dress wear as people shop for special occasions and updated the return to office looks. At the Rack banner, Beauty grew high single digits as consumers responded well to our expanded offerings with brands like MAC and Clinique.Department store, shopping, centerPhoto by Carl Raw on UnsplashTo illustrate our efforts to get to a cleaner inventory position, seasonal categories, including outerwear, sweaters and boots, had strong sell-through with ending inventory levels 30% less than prior year. After a robust start to 2022, our designer business softened in the back half, and we are reviewing our inventory positions to adjust where needed to improve productivity. At the Nordstrom banner, we're making progress on delivering selection, relevance and inspiration to our customers by partnering with brands in alternative ways. We grew our sales through unowned inventory models by 10% over the last year, and they now make up 12% of GMV at the Nordstrom banner. We continue to scale our Nordstrom Media Network, which grew over 50% versus last year.In the fourth quarter, we expanded our advertising offering to brands and categories adjacent to Nordstrom, launched offsite partnerships with TikTok and Pinterest and scaled on-site advertising with display ads on nordstrom.com. Our brand partners value the opportunity to connect with our highly engaged and loyal customers with a strong return on ad spend, particularly as advertisers look to diversify their media mix. Now on to our initiatives. As Erik mentioned, we're focused on improving Rack performance. And 1 of the initiatives to drive sales and faster inventory turn is prioritizing 100 strategic brands that are well known and loved across the U.S. but also have room to grow in the off-price space. Strategic brands have better productivity than other brands in terms of average selling price and monthly sell-through.These include many brands we carry at the Nordstrom banner. As we previously mentioned, 90% of the top 50 brands at Nordstrom are also carried at Nordstrom Rack. Looking forward, our healthier inventory levels provide us an open-to-buy position and we are leaning into strategic brands. While these brands accounted for half of Rack sales in 2022, they make up 60% of our on order for the first half of '23. We're still on track to have the Rack assortment in a good place by mid-'23. With more open to buy and access to great brands, especially in the current environment, we are well positioned to deliver a more constant stream of newness and improve inventory flow. A second initiative at Rack is to expand our reach with new stores as part of our closer-to-use strategy, we are encouraged by the results of our three newest stores, which have exceeded our expectations and performed better than the fleet average in terms of sales productivity.This proof point gives us further confidence in the product mix we're working towards and the opportunity for improvement in a Rack business through greater focus on strategic brands, newness and inventory flow. The third initiative with Rack is driving greater customer engagement and profitability at nordstromrack.com. By increasing the penetration of strategic brands online and leveraging our digital marketing capabilities, we will drive traffic and sales both at nordstromrack.com and in our stores. We also continue to drive omnichannel engagement across banners. For example, one in five nordstrom.com, buy online, pick up in store orders are actually picked up at our Rack stores after we launched this service just three years ago. The second area of focus across both banners is increasing our inventory productivity.This started with entering 2023 in a healthier inventory position. Looking forward, we have conservative buy plans in place, consistent with our outlook for continued macroeconomic pressure on consumer spending. We are also maintaining increased reserves against our buy plans, which enables us to be opportunistic in season, and we are planning for faster inventory turns with an increase of at least 10% over 2022 to drive newness and flow while also increasing the return on our inventory investment. We are also enhancing our capabilities to manage inventory with greater precision at the unit level through investments in RFID and the shift to cost accounting for internal merchandising. These capabilities will help us deliver a fresh and relevant assortment at the store level for our customers.It will also improve our ability to buy, allocate and track merchandise across our network provide us greater visibility in the profitability at the unit level, increase efficiency and reduce shrinkage. Our third focus area, continuing to enhance our supply chain capabilities is also an essential part of our closer-to-use strategy. We built momentum throughout 2022 on several initiatives to improve the customer experience and our profitability despite ongoing cost pressures. I'll highlight a few. We made significant progress in optimizing our unit flow from suppliers to customers by both changing some of our ordering practices as well as partnering with suppliers on shipment standards, and we'll be rolling this out further this year. We improved productivity and throughput in our distribution and fulfillment centers by more than 20% through better unit flow, focusing on team member retention and leveraging data for scheduling and training.Lastly, we increased delivery speed from click to delivery overall. For instance, our share of orders delivered within four days or less is up 40% from last year. These actions will continue to improve the customer experience, increased sell-through and reduce markdowns by allowing us to place the right assortment with the right depth closer to the customer. We expect to see further benefits from these efforts as well as from additional supply chain actions throughout 2023. In closing, we are entering 2023 positioned for increased agility and are focused on our key priorities for improving the customer experience and our profitability. We especially want to thank our team for their ongoing commitment to helping our customers feel good and look their best.With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss our financial results.Michael Maher: Thank you, Pete. I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then walk through our outlook for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.74. Net sales in GMV each decreased 4%. For the full year, total revenue, net sales and GMV were all up 5%. In Q4, Nordstrom banner sales decreased 2% and GMV decreased 3% versus last year. Nordstrom Rack sales decreased 8%, with a little over half of this decrease attributable to the elimination of Rack store fulfillment starting in the third quarter. Digital sales decreased 13% this quarter including an estimated 500 basis point impact from eliminating Rack store fulfillment and sunsetting Trunk Club earlier in 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 525 basis points, primarily due to higher markdowns as we prioritized rightsizing inventory to start fiscal 2023 in a healthier position.Ending inventory decreased 15% from a year ago compared to a 4% decrease in fourth quarter sales. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to inventory management in 2023 with a goal of improving turns by at least 10%. Despite lower sales than last year, total SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales decreased 240 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to supply chain expense efficiencies. As with last quarter, we're pleased with the progress we made on our supply chain optimization initiatives despite labor and transportation cost pressures. We expect these initiatives will continue to deliver significant benefits in 2023. EBIT margin was 4.5% for the fourth quarter. For the year, EBIT margin was 3.1%, and adjusted EBIT margin was 3.3%.We have a strong balance sheet and financial position, ending the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in available liquidity, including the full $800 million available on our revolving line of credit. Turning to our 2023 outlook. I'll start by discussing the macroeconomic backdrop and the related assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect that elevated inflation and rising interest rates will continue to weigh on consumer spending, especially in the first half of the year. We also anticipate continuing inflationary pressure on our expenses, especially labor and transportation costs. However, we also expect global supply chain disruptions to continue to dissipate, benefiting inbound freight costs and inventory flow. Taking these factors into consideration, for fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to decline 4% to 6% versus 2022.This outlook includes two significant items worth calling out. The first is an approximately 2.5 percentage point negative impact from the wind down of our Canadian operations, which delivered sales of approximately $400 million in 2022. The second is an approximately 1.3 percentage point positive impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, which we expect will add approximately $200 million in sales to the fourth quarter. Next, I'll highlight three factors that shape our outlook between the first and the second half of 2023. Year-over-year sales comparisons will be more difficult in the first half against our stronger first half in 2022, with more favorable comparisons expected in the second half. In addition, one week of the anniversary sale will shift from the second quarter into the third quarter this year.This will negatively impact second quarter sales and positively impact third quarter sales by approximately 200 basis points. We expect improvements in our business to build into the second half especially in the Rack as our merchandise assortment continues to improve, and we open new stores. We will also lap the impact of discontinuing Rack store fulfillment of online orders beginning in the third quarter. As a result of these factors, we expect revenue to decrease by a low double-digit percentage in the first half and to increase by a low single-digit percentage in the second half versus 2022. We expect the wind down of our Canadian operations to result in onetime pretax charges of $300 million to $350 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily related to the write-off of our investment in Nordstrom Canada.These charges will reduce our first quarter and full year earnings per share by approximately $1.40 to $1.60. Excluding these charges, we expect an adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 3.7% to 4.2% for the full year versus 3.3% in 2022. Our forecast assumes that adjusted EBIT margin expansion will be driven primarily by gross margin improvements from our focus on inventory productivity, especially in the second half of the year when compared to the elevated markdowns we took in 2022. The wind down of Canadian operations will also improve EBIT, excluding onetime charges by approximately $35 million. with most of the associated 20 basis points of EBIT margin improvement reflected in buying and occupancy costs as part of our gross profit margin.Continued progress on our supply chain optimization initiatives, will help partially mitigate SG&amp;A expense deleverage resulting from lower sales and inflationary cost pressures. Given the previously mentioned sales and gross margin trends, we expect EBIT margin increases in the second half of the year offsetting decreases from lower sales in the first half of the year. Our plan assumes that first quarter EBIT will be roughly breakeven. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 32% for the fiscal year which includes an estimated 500 basis point impact from the onetime Canada charges. Our tax rate, excluding this impact is expected to be approximately 27%. We expect earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.80. Excluding charges related to the wind down of Canadian operations, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 to $220 million.Our earnings per share projections exclude the impact of share repurchases, if any. Shifting to capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We are planning capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales, primarily for investments in supply chain and technology capabilities. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction. We ended the year at 3.1 time and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5 time. We continue to return cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share.In addition, during fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately $62 million of our stock at an average price of $22 per share. We have $438 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We will continue to take a measured approach to share repurchases aligning with our cash flow and market conditions. As you've heard today, we are taking significant steps to execute with agility given the continued challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We are prioritizing initiatives that will drive greater profitability through improved performance at Rack, a disciplined approach to increase inventory productivity and continued progress on our supply chain optimization efforts. We are confident in our ability to navigate through economic uncertainty and remain excited about the future of our business and our ability to deliver significant shareholder value over time.With that, Sarah, we're ready for questions.Sara Penner: Thank you, Michael.

Gallagher AJG and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. RYAN.Industry: Insurance BrokerageLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2062841/4-insurance-brokers-to-watch-despite-industry-challengesBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity.Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesGovernment initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players.Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #160, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, signifies bleak near-term prospects.

The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies MMC, Aon plc AON, Arthur J. Gallagher AJG and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. RYAN.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

The home of gambling in the US set to host Sweet 16 and the Elite Eight games later this month. This brick and mortar boost comes as online sports gambling continues to roll out state by state. Here to discuss the growing market of online sports gambling ahead of March Madness is Adam Greenblatt, BetMGM CEO, along with our Senior Gaming Analyst Josh Schafer. Good to see you both. All right, Adam, let's start with you. Good to see you, man. So given the additional states that have come online, given the hoops that we mentioned, March Madness in Vegas, what are your expectations for this as a gaming moment the next couple of weeks?ADAM GREENBLATT: So March Madness is one of our tentpole events of the year. And, in fact, over the course of the tournament, we see more action than the Super Bowl collectively. So this year will be leaps and bounds ahead of any prior, and even ahead of this year's Super Bowl. So really looking forward to it.JOSH SCHAFER: And, Adam, you have those games in Vegas this year, obviously, MGM. It seems like part of the product with BetMGM is to get BetMGM users to then go also to MGM, the brick and mortar business itself too. I'm curious how you think those games in Vegas might play into that strategy and if you think you're going to see a boost there.ADAM GREENBLATT: Well, omnichannel. It's a great question. Omnichannel is central to BetMGM's strategy. In all of MGM's properties in Las Vegas, you will find a BetMGM sportsbook. And what we do is we recruit players who are in Vegas, perhaps for a visit or even visiting the property and are locals, but we recruit them to digital as part of their retail experience. And what that means is that we develop an active relationship that we continue when that patron gets home, when that patron goes to a sports betting state.Story continuesAnd in the other direction is also important for us because success looks like driving traffic to MGM Resorts properties. And we found that this year, 2022 rather, about 50%-- it's just around 50%-- of new MGM Resorts rewards members were driven by BetMGM. So we're pretty excited about this omnichannel relationship.- You mentioned March Madness exceeding even the Super Bowl. It's still only three weeks ago. In reflection, do you have any numbers just how much bigger that event was, given that you've got 36 states now allowing legal sports betting, 26 that allow mobile sports betting, and do you have any predictions about what lies ahead with the Vegas Super Bowl this year?ADAM GREENBLATT: Well, let me start with Vegas first because that's the part that I'm most excited about. 2024 is going to be enormous for us. The rules, the regulations of that to drive participation, govern participation in Nevada are different from other states, which means in Vegas MGM is king. And so we're very much looking to capitalize on the fact that MGM accounts for about 40% of hotel stock along the Strip.And Allegiant Stadium, where the Super Bowl is going to take place, is just across the highway from some of MGM's iconic properties like the Mandalay Bay. So we're expecting a huge number of people to walk through MGM properties as part of their Super Bowl '24 experience. And, of course, only Vegas can do parties Vegas style. So I think next year's Super Bowl is going to be the best yet. In terms of numbers, there are-- in anticipation of March Madness, we've been really actively focusing on efficiency within BetMGM.So what that means is invest less in those who are more interested in perhaps promotional participation and more in those who are sincere sports bettors who like our brand, who like our product. So there's-- in terms of volumes, there's a plus and a minus. So net-net, my expectation is we'll probably be about 20% up on bet count. But I think that's a conservative estimate.JOSH SCHAFER: Adam, it is Problem Gambling Awareness Month as well. And I'm curious what you make of MGM's push there. What does MGM sort of hoping to get out of this month as far as awareness goes? And then also, as a company, I mean, how do you balance that with, obviously, you want more people to gamble and you want more business to come in to the book itself. So how do you sort of balance those two things there?ADAM GREENBLATT: Look, this is an existential issue for our sector, for our business. And, frankly, it's not just MGM. It's BetMGM that is championing this initiative along with MGM Resorts. We have a number of initiatives to ensure that the relationship with our product is fun and entertaining. And we're investing in research. We're investing in our partnership with award-winning problem gambling program GameSense, which really focuses on positive interaction, educational interaction, and, of course, the provision of resources to those who might be looking for extra support with their gambling.We're, as I say, investing heavily in research to take the myth away from problem gambling, raise the facts, raise the profile of gambling being a leisure and entertainment experience and, frankly, demonstrate to the naysayers that we are sincere about this effort. And why? Because if we don't get in front, we as an industry, as a business get in front of this issue, we don't have to look far outside of the US to see what lies down the road. And just to put a finer point, a monetary point on this, in the sense of beginning of 2021, BetMGM has paid taxes of more than a billion dollars, a billion dollars of tax in two years. This is an important aspect to get right with our industry-- with our stakeholders, which include regulators and lawmakers.- And the National Council on Problem Gaming says it's 60% to 80% of high school students have legally gambled in the last year and that 4% to 6% are actually problem addicted gamblers. I confess. I have a 15-year-old who gambles on a daily basis. I'm told they play online poker in class. You said you're doing research. Are you aware of that problem among our nation's youth? And how concerned are you?ADAM GREENBLATT: So I think what you've just shared is a really compelling reason why every state should have regulated lawful gaming because it's happening everywhere. It's happening in an unregulated fashion everywhere. We at BetMGM know every player who we interact with, where they are. They've gone through KYC. We know that they're over age. So over 21. We know exactly where the bet takes place. We know all of their betting history.And so with our sophisticated analytics, we're able to then start to see patterns in the data, start to see player level behavior. And so where is the future? The future is analyzing at a player level changes in behavior, which are the early signals, the early signs of a problem starting to arise. And we can intervene. I have a whole team of people whose only job it is to interact with players for whom there is some concern or some questions. Now, illegal and unlicensed operators don't have that and are not committed to maintaining a healthy business as we are.- And we parents probably need to do a better job, I confess myself. BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt, Josh Schafer, thank you both. Excellent discussion.]"

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Ms. John. Please proceed.Jessica John: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings and business update call.

Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures.Story continuesA reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?Frank Del Rio: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year like no other in our company's 56-year history. As we successfully concluded our great cruise come back, with the last vessel in our fleet reentering service midway through the year. Our team continually push forward to this challenging transition year, achieving several significant milestones on our road to recovery and preparing for the next chapter of our storied brands. With our full fleet back to the high seas, we significantly ramped up occupancy levels carrying nearly 1.7 million guests welcomed our newest ship, Norwegian Prima to our world-class fleet, reached several critical financial inflection points, maintained our industry-leading pricing and perhaps more telling, ended the year in a record booked position for 2023 and at record prices.These accomplishments are even more impressive when considering they were achieved against the backdrop of lingering COVID-19 impacts as well as ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. I want to take the opportunity to once again thank our entire team, both shore-side and shipboard for their hard work, dedication and tenacity, which has propelled us forward as we strive to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world. I'm incredibly proud, honored and inspired to work alongside each and every one of you. And I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors and all of our stakeholders for their continued support and partnership. Shifting our attention to what is certainly a bright future for our company, let's turn to slide six, which outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we have on the horizon.First, we are encouraged to see that our target consumer, which tends to skew more upmarket in the broader cruise industry, continues to be financially healthy and resilient and is prioritizing consumption of experiences over the purchase of physical goods. We've talked previously about the two high-level indicators we carefully monitor to evaluate the willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel. The first being the length of the booking curve, which is a forward-looking indicator and the second one being onboard revenue, a real-time indicator of a consumer's actual spending, both of which continue to hold strong with no signs of fading. In fact, the booking window in the fourth quarter was well elongated compared to the same quarter in 2019.Onboard revenue also continues to be a bright spot with gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, approximately 25% higher than the comparable 2019 period. The bottom-line is our target consumer continues to be willing to spend on travel and experiences now and in the future. This gives us confidence that not only is the incredible value proposition for cruising resonating with consumers, but the unique and compelling offerings of our three brands are also appealing to their respective markets. Second, we are taking actions across our business to align with our strategic priorities and strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This includes a broad and ongoing initiative we began in the fourth quarter to improve operating efficiencies and to right-size our cost base so that we can rebuild and enhance our margins.You may ask why start this initiative now? While the past few years have been unlike anything we could have imagined. First, we were focused on taking the necessary measures to withstand a prolonged and unprecedented period of disruption by minimizing cash burn, raising capital, enhancing our health and safety programs to adapt to a rapidly evolving public health environment and advocating for the industry to restart cruise operations. We then shifted our focus to relaunching our operations while providing our discerning guests the same unparalleled vacation experience they expect from our leading brands. We also took this unique opportunity to raise the bar on pricing for the long-term. Now that our phased occupancy ramp is nearly complete, and our loyal guests know that cruising in our brands is back and even better than before, we are squarely focused on how to maximize profitability as we embark on a period of transformational growth.Every aspect of our business is being evaluated through the lens of how we can realize our full value potential for all stakeholders. We are exploring further opportunities, first and foremost, to reduce our cost profile and to maximize revenue generation. You've likely seen some of the actions we've already taken to improve our cost structure, including normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone on turn as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities. And of course, we will not lose sight of our guests, the very heart of our business, and we will continue to prioritize delivering an exceptional guest experience and superior service levels.The last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading newbuild pipeline. This year, for the first time in our history, we are gearing up to deliver one newbuild for each of our brands, as shown on slide seven, adding over 5,000 additional berths to our fleet including an over 20% increase in our upscale berths. On a capacity day basis, this will result in approximately 19% growth in 2023 compared to 2019. As you can see on slide eight, we have made some modifications to our newbuild pipeline primarily related to the last two shifts in the Prima Class. These ships have been lengthened in part to accommodate the future use of alternative fuels. We now expect gross tonnage for the third and fourth Prima Class to be approximately 10% larger and the fifth and sixth Pima Class ships to be approximately 20% larger than Norwegian, Prima and Viva.As a result, delivery days have shifted a bit, and we now expect one larger Prima Class ship to be delivered each year from 2025 to 2028. We remain confident in our ability to profitably absorb this capacity with continued consumer demand for travel, our expansion into the many unserved and underserved markets around the world that our brands have not yet tapped into, and on the broader industry's vast under-penetration particularly when compared to land-based vacation alternatives. Shifting our discussion now to our booking, demand and pricing trends. As you can see on slide nine, in the fourth quarter, our load factor reached 87%, in line with guidance. This is approximately 20% below the comparable 2019 quarter, yet demonstrates another sequential improvement in closing the occupancy gap versus 2019.This ramp is continuing through the first quarter of 2023 as we have already achieved 100% occupancy in the quarter, leading to a return to historical levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. In terms of pricing, slide 10, illustrates another strong result in the pricing front with our net per DM growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, up approximately 14% on an as reported basis and up 15% in constant currency over 2019. Turning to slide 11, at year end, our cumulative book position for 2023 was within our optimal range of approximately 60% to 65%. We continue to believe this is our sweet spot as it strikes the delicate balance of encouraging guests to book early while also optimizing pricing. Full year 2023 book position is now ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices.Since we last spoke in November, we have been pleased to see positive booking momentum continue, including a very strong wave season that likely started two months earlier than usual. In fact, November was a record-breaking month for Norwegian Cruise Line as they celebrate a record day, record week and record month of sales boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday push. Subsequently, in January, a strong start to traditional wave led the line of setting another record booking month. Our Regent brand also experienced a similar positive reception to it 2023 wave offer launch, which resulted in a record launch day with net booking volume nearly four times last year's wave launch and 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our current cumulative book position and the strong demand dynamics that we continue to experience across our brands gives us further confidence that we can achieve our 2023 guidance, which Mark will discuss shortly in more detail.I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?Best Places to Live Right Outside NYC with Easiest Commutemandritoiu/Shutterstock.comMark Kempa: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2022 financial results, 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics is on a constant currency basis. Slide 12 outlines key metrics highlighting our fourth quarter results, nearly all of which met or exceeded guidance. Focusing on the top line, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise in the quarter, up approximately 24% versus 2019, with net per diems increasing approximately 15%, continuing the strong pricing performance we have achieved since our re-launch.Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, was in line with expectations, with the second half 2022 decreasing approximately 10% versus the first half as our operations continue to ramp up. As our 2023 guidance indicates, second half 2022 is not representative of a go-forward run rate. For the second half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven. We did, however, achieve another significant milestone in the fourth quarter, generating positive adjusted free cash flow for the first time in three years. This represents another stepping stone as we return to a normalized operating environment. Looking at expectations for the full year 2023 on slide 14. We are pleased to return to our normal cadence of providing annual and quarterly guidance.Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.70 at the midpoint of our guidance. Taking a closer look at the components of this outlook, net per diem growth is expected in the range of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019. This translates to net yield for the year expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6.5%. This stellar top line performance is reflective of our go-to-market strategy and emphasis on price discipline. Moving to costs, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $160 for the full year.This represents a nearly 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. The key drivers of this expected decrease includes the scaling back and normalization of marketing investments, which were elevated in the second half of 2022 as we focused on resetting expectations and raising the bar on pricing during our re-launch; moderation in hyperinflationary pressures in certain areas, including food and logistics; normalization of capacity days as a result of the elimination of previously acquired protocols; timing and optimization of scheduled drydocks; and finally, the results of our operating efficiency and cost minimization efforts as part of our broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative that Frank touched on.Keep in mind that costs are expected to sequentially trend lower over the course of the year as occupancy increases and reduction initiatives are realized, which is expected to lead to a lower cost run rate as we exit 2023 as compared to our full year guidance. As we have consistently communicated, our costs will be elevated when compared to 2019 baseline, both due to normal and hyperinflation over the past three years to four years as well as a mixed headwind as we add higher operating cost capacity, which we do expect will gain a premium on the top-line. I want to reiterate that we are committed to right-sizing our cost base and are taking deliberate actions across our business to best position us for the future as a stronger and leaner organization.There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies, while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience. Our goal is not only to rebuild our margins, but over time, continue to enhance them, and we look forward to demonstrating this improvement over the coming quarters. Now, let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. Compared to 2019 levels, net per diem is expected to increase approximately 6.75% to 7.75%, while net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.25% to 2.25%, primarily as a result of our continued occupancy ramp and with pricing expected to be higher for the remaining quarters of 2023. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 12% below the second half of 2022.First quarter is expected to be the highest cost quarter due to lower occupancy and as actions taken in recent months to reduce costs will not yet be fully realized. When looking at our implied guidance for the remaining quarters of 2023, the expected decrease in cost is approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2022. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $195 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be a loss of approximately $0.45. Moving to our balance sheet. Slide 15 demonstrates the results of our deliberate and opportunistic measures to optimize our debt maturity profile. In 2023, we have approximately $1 billion of scheduled debt service, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing.In recent months, we also addressed a large portion of our 2024 maturities. First, we completed an amendment of our operating credit facility and extended approximately $1.4 billion of this facility by one year to January 2025. Earlier this month, we took advantage of significant improvements in the bond markets to complete a refinancing transaction of the remaining non-extended term loans under the operating credit facility. We issued $600 million of new 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and use the proceeds to repay these term loans, allowing us to de-risk and replace near-term debt maturities with longer-dated debt at only a marginally higher cost. As you can see, with these actions, we have a manageable maturity profile over the course of the next few years.When you look at the totality of our debt, approximately 40% is ECA back debt. This is a unique differentiator of the cruise industry, which is part of a broader connected ecosystem, which includes, among others, the operators, the shipyards and the governments and export credit agencies, all of which rely on shipyards and suppliers for significant economic and employment related benefits. As all of our interests closely align, these partners are incredibly supportive, as demonstrated by the very efficient financing we are able to secure for our new-builds as well as the support they provided during the pandemic. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments, we also provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website.Turning to liquidity, our overall liquidity position remains strong. And just last night, we announced two transactions, which further enhance our liquidity and outlined on page -- on slide 16. First, we revised and extend our existing $1 billion undrawn backstop commitment, as part of the agreement to secure a second year extension option on the commitment, the company issued $250 million of 9.75% notes due 2028. At the same time, we revised the undrawn commitment to reduce the amount to $650 million, with the agreement now extending through February 2024, with the option at our sole election to extend through 2025. We do not currently intend to draw on this commitment. And in total, the combination of these two actions provides the company approximately $900 million of liquidity to the bottom-line.Second, we also entered into a new $300 million unsecured and undrawn backstop commitment. This facility will be available to draw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Securing this facility provides a backstop for the remaining portion of the non-extending operating credit facility which matures in January 2024. Pro forma for these recent transactions, our liquidity position at year-end is approximately $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $650 million, under the available commitment. For housekeeping, this does not include the enhancement to future liquidity we obtained with the $300 million undrawn commitment as it is currently not available to draw. Before handing the call back -- handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate our relentless focus on executing on our medium- and long-term financial strategy, as laid out on slide 18.We will continue to be opportunistic and are committed to delivering value for all stakeholders. But most of all, we are excited to be back in full operation and once again delivering incredible vacation experiences on our three brands to all corners of the globe. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments.Frank Del Rio: Thank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail &amp; Sustain, which slide 19 outlines, a few key highlights. Since we last spoke, we have made meaningful progress to advance our commitment to pursue net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We successfully completed the testing of biodiesel fuel blends on three additional ships in our fleet, a promising potential lever to help reduce emissions on our existing fleet. In addition, we recently modified our contracts to the final two PRIMA Class Ships for Norwegian Cruise Line scheduled for delivery in 2027 and 2028 to reconfigure these ships to accommodate green methanol and as an alternative fuel source in the future.While additional modifications will be needed in the future to fully enable the use of dual fuel, both methanol and diesel, this action reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and represents an important and exciting step forward in our pursuit of net zero. Before turning the call over to Q&amp;A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on slide 20. First, we believe we are well positioned in the current economic environment and our target upmarket consumer remains resilient. This is especially true for the all-import North American consumer from we enjoy an outsized benefit, given our strategic sourcing mix and focus on global versus national brands. Second, booking momentum is positive, buoyed by a strong start to the year with wave season, and we are pleased with our book position and pricing for 2023.Third, we are focused on strengthening the foundation for sustained profitable growth, and we will continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next era. And lastly, our cash generation engine continues to rev up which, along with our transformational new build pipeline provides a path to meet our liquidity needs and to restore our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered quite a bit today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Operator?Operator: Thank you, Frank.Jessica John: Before we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address a top question from our online shareholder Q&amp;A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and upvote questions from management. The top question this quarter was what are our plans to bring in new customers and also reward brand loyalists to entice them to cruise. Frank, do you want to take that one?Frank Del Rio: Sure. I think both past guests and new guests are absolutely critical for our continued growth. We have a great base of loyal guests who love our product because each of our brands have incredibly high repeat rates running anywhere from 45% for the Norwegian brand to as high as 55% for region. And we're always looking for new ways to engage with them, including through our popular loyalty programs that each brand operates. We also have a robust new build pipeline as we just finished discussing. One new build being introduced for each brand this year alone and we all know new ships and above surrounding new ships have historically brought outsized attention to the brand. Just consider the buzz when Katy Perry performed as godmother of Norwegian Prima this past summer.And just recently, Giada De Laurentiis was named Godmother of Oceania upcoming Vista, which highlights the brand's focus on having the fun is to choosing it see. These announcements create excitement, not just among loyal guests, but also to new brand and even new to cruise guests. You've heard us say many times that the cruise industry as a whole is vastly underpenetrated, and we have significantly -- have a significant runway ahead to attract new to cruise guests, creating awareness, drawing buzz, partnering with a traveling community even having investors such as yourselves, deliver the message, of the value and unique experiences that cruises offer is a large part of what we do every single day, and we'll continue to do so to drive that message to as many possible guess as we possibly can.See also 11 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks to Buy and 23 Best Countries in the World to Live in if You're a Woman .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces new industrial-grade SPE products that will help fulfill SPE’s promise, from 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHYs that more easily connect edge IIoT devices to the cloud, to industrial versions of its 100BASE-T1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) Ethernet PHY transceivers and switches that enable higher-speed applications across far-reaching Ethernet networks.“Microchip is helping to fuel the adoption of zonal architectures in industrial applications with our new MAC-PHYs that connect to many of Microchip’s microcontrollers (MCUs) to reduce the design complexity and implementation costs for bringing a host of sensors, actuators and other products into the new 10BASE-T1S network infrastructure,” said Matthias Kaestner, vice president at Microchip. “With these new 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHYs and industrial versions of our 100BASE-T1 TSN products, we are making it easier to connect the physical world to the cloud while enabling a seamless Ethernet architecture throughout the IIoT and other industrial networks.”Microchip’s new LAN8650 and LAN8651 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHY Ethernet Controllers with Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) simplify the implementation of zonal architectures by enabling basic MCUs, rather than higher-level MCUs with a Media Access Controller (MAC), to be used when creating sensors, actuators and other devices for the edge of OT and IT networks. These low-speed devices do not need their own communication system, and Microchip’s MAC-PHYs connect them into a standard Ethernet system all the way to the cloud over simple twisted-pair wiring.Story continuesFor industrial applications that require higher bandwidth, designers can use MCUs with an integrated Ethernet MAC. Microchip now offers an industrial-grade version of its LAN8770 100BASE-T1 Ethernet PHY Transceiver that provides 100 Mbps transmit and receive capability over a single Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable.Microchip’s SPE portfolio is enhanced with industrial-grade versions of its LAN937x and LAN938x Gigabit Ethernet TSN Switches with integrated 100BASE-T1 PHYs. These scalable, secure and compact SPE switches include hardware time-stamping features for supporting IEEE 802.1AS (gPTP) and IEEE 1588v2 (PTP) time synchronization, among other TSN functionality. Energy-efficiency features include ultra-deep-sleep power down with remote wake for battery applications.“Microchip’s industrial-grade 100BASE-T1 offerings reduce cost, wiring and installation complexity by enabling a complete SPE network from device to server,” said Charles Forni, vice president of Microchip’s USB and networking business unit. “Our industrial-grade SPE offerings are built to withstand harsh environmental conditions across an expanded temperature range while delivering enhanced performance, such as safety, security and extended cable reach, to support industrial applications.”Development ToolsTo support the design efforts of these new products a set of network analysis tools and evaluation boards are available including the LAN8651 EVB and EVB-LAN9383. Microchip’s MPLAB® Harmony v3 provides software support to configure, debug and program designs, while the MPLAB Network Creator provides a quick and intuitive graphical interface for switch configuration.Pricing and AvailabilityMicrochip’s LAN8650 and LAN8651 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHYs and its LAN937x and LAN938x 100BASE-T1 Ethernet Switches and LAN8770 100BASE-T1 Ethernet PHY are available for purchase at Microchip’s Purchasing and Client Services website, www.microchipDIRECT.com.For additional information or to purchase, contact a Microchip sales representative or authorized worldwide distributor.ResourcesHigh-res images available through Flickr or editorial contact (feel free to publish):  •  Application image: www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/52645158266/sizes/lAbout Microchip Technology  Microchip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusMetLife (MET) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -4.34% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.5 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.89%. In comparison, the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield is 1.97%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.69%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2 is up 1% from last year. In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.54%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, MetLife's payout ratio is 29%, which means it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.28 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 20.88%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

What’s more, an overwhelming majority of consultants, 93%, have taken some action regarding retirement income options.""Since SECURE 1.0 made it easier to offer retirement income options in DC plans, we’ve seen both consultants and plan sponsors become more comfortable with these solutions,"" says Roberta Rafaloff, vice president, Institutional Income Annuities, MetLife. ""In fact, our study found 60% of consultants say they are likely to consider purchasing an annuity option for themselves, showing they understand the security these solutions offer retirees.""Increasing Activity Around Guaranteed Retirement Income OptionsAmong the actions consultants have taken, 68% have conducted due diligence/evaluated the guaranteed retirement income options available in the DC market, 63% have met with their clients’ investment committees to discuss the addition of a guaranteed retirement income option, and 48% recommended that their clients consider incorporating a guaranteed retirement income option in their DC plan.Consultants report plan sponsors are taking action as well, with 56% of consultants stating their plan sponsor clients have conducted due diligence and 55% state their plan sponsors have met with their investment committees to discuss the addition of a guaranteed retirement income option. Four in ten (40%) consultants say their plan sponsors have issued a Request for Proposal/Request for Information from insurance companies/annuity providers.Story continuesPotential Obstacles with Newer SolutionsEven though consultants and plan sponsors have taken positive steps in incorporating retirement income options into DC plans, some potential challenges remain. While low adoption rates have traditionally been attributed to lack of interest and negative impressions of annuities, 47% of consultants say the biggest issue that stands in the way of their clients implementing these solutions is that these products are complex and difficult for them to explain.In fact, when asked to characterize the new solutions that have been introduced to the market since SECURE 1.0 passed – many of which are investment options with embedded income – 62% of consultants say they are difficult to understand.""It may be tempting to offer products with many features to address the various potential needs of plan participants,"" says Rafaloff. ""But a complex solution may not be successful, creating confusion for plan sponsors and participants. Simplicity should be the guiding principle when looking at these offerings. Immediate income annuities and qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLAC) are products that tend to be much easier to understand.""The Importance of Simplicity and GuaranteesConsultants cite simplicity, along with guarantees, as the most important product attributes for retirement income solutions. According to the study, 96% of consultants state it is important (i.e., critical or very important) that the product guarantees money will not run out and the same percentage, 96%, report a product that is simple and easy for participants to understand is important when evaluating these solutions.The Future of Guaranteed Retirement Income OptionsAs the market continues to evolve, consultants and their plan sponsor clients are showing growing interest in these solutions and are taking steps to offer them in DC plans. To date, one in 10 plan sponsors, 11%, say they have incorporated a guaranteed retirement income option into their DC plan post-SECURE 1.0. Among plan sponsor-clients that aren’t yet making retirement income solutions available to their plan participants, consultants say 27% of their clients are considering offering a retirement income option in their DC plan, many within the next 5 years.About the StudyThe survey was conducted online by Greenwald Research, in partnership with ISS Media, owner of PLANADVISER and PLANSPONSOR magazines, on behalf of MetLife between October 25 and December 9, 2022, among 74 defined contribution (DC) plan consultants. Consultants needed to be at least somewhat knowledgeable about various DC plan retirement income options; at least occasionally recommend DC retirement income options to plan sponsor-clients, or if not, be at least somewhat likely to in the near future; and, have at least one retirement plan client with $500+ million in assets.About MetLifeMetLife, Inc.

(NYSE:MET) shareholders may have reason to be concerned, as several insiders sold their shares over the past year. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for MetLife The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MetLifeIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of Global Technology &amp; Operations, Bill Pappas, sold US$378k worth of shares at a price of US$75.55 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$69.69. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year MetLife insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At MetLife Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of MetLife shares. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; Chief HR Officer Susan Podlogar ditched US$216k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of MetLifeFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. MetLife insiders own about US$88m worth of shares. That equates to 0.2% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At MetLife Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for MetLife you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.But note: MetLife may not be the best stock to buy.

Moreover, MetLife Investment Management has a strong presence in the United States, with a general account portfolio consisting mainly of fixed-income securities and mortgage loans.

Decio Oddone, chief executive of Enauta and former head of Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency, said the tax decision represents a departure from the country’s tradition of respecting contracts.Oddone said, as quoted by Reuters, that this tradition has been essential for the success of recent oil and gas tenders, which in turn have led to an increase in oil and gas investments.""This was fundamental for us to be able to attract that amount of investment that we attracted between 2017 and 2020, which allowed the resumption of production,"" he said.Even Petrobras, the state energy major, is not a fan of the new levy. Speaking on the sidelines of CERAWeek, the company’s Jean Paul Prates said, as quoted by Bloomberg, that this was not a smart way to solve Brazil’s money problems and that Petrobras exports would suffer from it.Story continuesBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Are Set To Rise Throughout 2023Shell Is Reviewing Its Plan To Reduce Oil Production This DecadeOPEC Officials And U.S. Shale Executives Discuss Global Oil SupplyRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The ban on Russian oil by Europe forces Moscow's exports to travel further to reach buyers.""That means more miles traveling in the water,"" Torbjorn Tornqvist, co-founder of the Gunvor Group, a trading company, said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. ""Ship rates have been very elevated and have stayed elevated.""Since the invasion, ""we have seen a fundamental shift that is unlikely to revert anytime soon,"" said Jose Fernandez, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department.Many expect lasting changes.""What I think will last very long is  the fundamental distrust and the fundamental decision to not depend on Russian energy for a very long time in Europe,"" said Eirik Waerness, chief economist at Equinor. ""That will have long-term implications.""Story continues- A 'tight' market -The flux in the wake of the Russian invasion has also strengthened the position of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Burkhard said Saudi Arabia's spare capacity continues to give the exporters group unique clout.But the situation has changed significantly compared with late 2016 when the Vienna-based cartel began coordinating policy with Russia.""Russia today cannot really manage its production because it faces sanctions,"" leading to production below Russia's quota under the ""OPEC+"" policy, Burkhard said.""OPEC is still very important, but OPEC+ right now is not what it was before the war,"" he said.The United States' role on international markets has also been reinforced.The world's biggest oil producer, the United States last week set a new record for crude exports of 5.6 million barrels per day, almost twice the level in 2021.Still, US production has not returned to its pre-pandemic level. Key factors that have weighed on output include the strategy of US shale producers to use excess cash to bolster balance sheets rather than increase capital spending; and shortages of key oilfield materials and personnel.""The volumes continue to increase, but they could probably have increased even more,"" Waerness said of the United States.Globally, markets continue to feel the effects of the decision by OPEC in October to trim production by two million barrels per day.""The fundamentals are relatively tight,"" Waerness said. ""The extra capacity to deliver new supplies into markets, whether we're talking about gas or oil, is very low.""Waerness said there are also questions about the sustainability of Russian production given the exodus of Western oilfield suppliers and service companies.""We don't know how long Russia can continue to produce 11 million barrel and 12 million barrels a day,"" Waerness said. ""Will they be able to replace that type of competence?""The situation is further complicated by the focus on the energy transition, which experts believe exacerbates under-investment in conventional petroleum.The upshot, according to Burkhard, is a higher baseline for crude prices.""We will have cycles, but the center of gravity for oil prices we think will be around $70 or $80,"" he said. ""That's higher than what we've typically seen over the last 20-30 years.""tu-jmb/dw]"

But those higher rates increase consumer borrowing costs, which can slow the economy.""The Fed is continuing to come ... for inflation and that is translating into fears over lower oil demand down the road because of a possible recession,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at investment advisory Again Capital LLC in New York.Brent futures fell $1.07, or 1.3%, to settle at $81.59 a barrel, their lowest close since Feb. 22.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 94 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $75.72, their lowest close since Feb. 27.That put both benchmarks down for a third day in a row with WTI down about 6% and Brent down about 5% during that time.The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased by the most in five months last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market.""Decelerating growth continues to weigh on crude prices,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA.Renewed hawkishness from the Fed is pushing investors to game out how a regime of “higher for longer” interest rates could weigh on U.S. stocks with some market watchers saying the combination of higher bond yields and sticky inflation bodes poorly for equity returns.Kilduff noted that the U.S. bond auction Thursday afternoon ""spooked the market"" and ""was the catalyst for the risk off sentiment"" for the oil and stock market declines.Crude futures and Wall Street stocks were both trading higher Thursday morning on thoughts the U.S. unemployment data could push the Fed to slow the pace of future interest rate hikes.Story continuesWall Street stocks fell on Thursday, with all three major stock indexes down as investors worried that a jobs report on Friday could spur aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Analysts expect the U.S. economy to have added 205,000 jobs last month - a sharp deceleration from January - and see the unemployment rate holding firm at 3.4%.Also supporting oil prices earlier on Thursday, TotalEnergies was unable to make deliveries from its French refineries on Thursday because of continued strike action a day after data showed an unexpected decline in U.S. crude inventories last week. [EIA/S]""The halt in deliveries from TotalEnergies' French refineries due to the nationwide strikes together with the slight weakness in the dollar might attract some shorts to cover part of their positions,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM told Reuters.(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in London, Stephanie Kelly in New York and Emily Chow in Singapore; Editing by David Goodman, Shounak Dasgupta, Paul Simao and Cynthia Osterman)]"

But arrivals of iron ore—the key steel-manufacturing material—jumped as steel mills stocked up in expectation of a government push to boost the economy via infrastructure projects.Despite weaker crude oil and natural gas imports early into the year and just after the Chinese reopening after nearly three years of strict Covid measures, analysts expect China’s oil imports to accelerate later this year and support global oil demand growth.China’s crude oil imports averaged 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in January and February, down by 1.3% compared to the same months in 2022, according to official Chinese data in tons estimated in barrels by Reuters’ Asia Commodities and Energy Columnist Clyde Russell. The imports were also below the more than 11.3 million bpd in crude imports in November and December last year.The weaker crude oil import levels could be due, in part, to the Lunar New Year holiday at the end of January and the fact that crude cargoes are typically arranged months ahead of their actual arrival and customs clearance.Related: Germany May Not Use All Its New LNG Capacity, But It Is Still Necessary“The latest trade data from China shows that crude oil imports in the nation remained weak at the start of the year as refiners eased purchases ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said on Tuesday, commenting on the import data.“China’s latest oil trade data hints at softer domestic demand which could weigh on sentiment in the short-to-medium term if imports do not recover,” they added.Story continuesThe economic momentum is expected to accelerate and lift crude oil demand as the year progresses, analysts say. That’s despite the fact that China set this week its lowest annual GDP growth target in decades. China aims for roughly 5% growth this year, lower than last year’s target and at the low end of analyst expectations.“Looking ahead, China’s crude oil imports could recover over the next quarter as industrial activity picks up and refiners rebuild their stocks,” ING said.The Chinese reopening and new refineries coming online are set to raise the imports in the world’s top crude oil importer to a record high this year, industry consultants told Reuters last month.Chinese crude oil imports could increase to an average as high as 11.8 million bpd this year, rising by between 500,000 bpd and 1 million bpd, according to Energy Aspects, FGE, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, and Wood Mackenzie. This would reverse the decline of 2021 and 2022 and beat the record of an average 10.8 million bpd in yearly crude oil imports from 2020.China’s resurgent oil demand—with growth seen at 900,000 bpd this year—along with demand in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region will dominate global oil demand growth in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its latest Oil Market Report in February.China’s demand for oil and gas could be one of the biggest annual growth stories, according to Mike Muller, head of Asia at the world’s largest independent oil trader, Vitol.“Most analysts have been revising their estimates for Chinese oil and gas consumption up, for the balance of this year, which will make 2023 one of the biggest year-on-year demand growth stories that we’ve seen, next to  2001-2002 and 2009,” Muller said on a Gulf Intelligence podcast this week.According to Victor Yang, senior analyst at JLC Network Technology, it doesn’t matter if China sets its GDP growth target at 5% or 5.5% as “international estimates are showing more optimistic growth.”“This is because we are now seeing oil demand in China growing significantly,” Yang told Gulf Intelligence this week.“In February, we imported about 11.8mn bd, a significant jump from the last quarter of last year, and demand is still on the rise.”China’s demand could be a major bullish factor for the oil market and prices this year, but the latest comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday dampened the bull market story after he said the Fed “would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes” if inflation continues to run hot. The market started pricing in again a stronger possibility of a 0.5 percentage point hike later this month.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Are Set To Rise Throughout 2023Shell Is Reviewing Its Plan To Reduce Oil Production This DecadeOPEC Officials And U.S. Shale Executives Discuss Global Oil SupplyRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. IPG, Omnicom Group Inc. OMC, WPP plc WPP, AdTheorent Holding Co. Inc. ADTH and Stagwell Inc. STGW.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Advertising Spending Likely to Remain Firm in 2023: 5 PicksThe U.S. economy has recovered impressively from pandemic-related setbacks buoyed by unprecedented fiscal and monetary support. However, the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and rock-solid demand supported by government stimuli resulted in both cost-push and demand-pull inflation. The inflation rate reached a 40-year high in June 2022.Consequently, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by a massive 4.25% in 2022. Market participants were thinking of a maximum 75 basis point rate hike in 2023. However, an unexpected spike in the inflation rate in January after three consecutive months of decline and several strong economic data have raised concerns that the Fed will continue its rigorous rate hike stance.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned of a possible recession in 2023. Several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched a big chunk of manpower especially in the high-income segment. The overall earnings of the broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to be down 9% year over year in first-quarter 2023 after declining 5.6% year over year in fourth-quarter 2022.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, several market research agencies have predicted that advertising and marketing spending is likely to remain firm in 2023. Therefore, it should be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank in this industry.Ad Spending to Stay SolidOn Dec 8, 2022, Forbes reported that advertisement spending is likely to increase year over year in 2023 in the United States and globally. However, the rate of increase will be subdued compared to the past two years.Story continuesMagna Global anticipates the U.S. ad spending to grow 3.7% in 2023 compared to an estimated 8% in 2022. Forrester projects U.S. ad spending to grow 4.6% in 2023 compared to an estimated 10.2% in 2022. Zenith expects the U.S. advertising spending to grow by $66 billion from 2022 to 2025. The U.S. market will account for nearly 44% of the global ad spending market size.BIA Advisory Services estimates that the U.S. ad market will total around $165.7 billion in 2023. The absolute figure remains solid despite a 0.5% decline year over year. Finally, Statista forecasts that U.S. digital ad spending will increase by 13.9% year over year to $297.4 billion in 2023.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five advertising and marketing stocks that have strong growth potential for 2023.

112,d00d3e45-ec3a-3714-818a-5431443acf41,OMC,2023-03-09,Advertisement Spending Likely to Remain Firm in 2023: 5 Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advertisement-spending-likely-remain-firm-130401236.html,1678107841,STORY,"['WPP.L', 'IPG', 'WPP', 'OMC']","[The U.S. economy has recovered impressively from pandemic-related setbacks buoyed by unprecedented fiscal and monetary support. However, the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and rock-solid demand supported by government stimuli resulted in both cost-push and demand-pull inflation. The inflation rate reached a 40-year high in June 2022.Consequently, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by a massive 4.25% in 2022. Market participants were thinking of a maximum 75 basis point rate hike in 2023. However, an unexpected spike in the inflation rate in January after three consecutive months of decline and several strong economic data have raised concerns that the Fed will continue its rigorous rate hike stance.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned of a possible recession in 2023. Several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched a big chunk of manpower especially in the high-income segment. The overall earnings of the broad-market S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to be down 9% year over year in first-quarter 2023 after declining 5.6% year over year in fourth-quarter 2022.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, several market research agencies have predicted that advertising and marketing spending is likely to remain firm in 2023. Therefore, it should be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank in this industry.Ad Spending to Stay SolidOn Dec 8, 2022, Forbes reported that advertisement spending is likely to increase year over year in 2023 in the United States and globally. However, the rate of increase will be subdued compared to the past two years.Magna Global anticipates the U.S. ad spending to grow 3.7% in 2023 compared to an estimated 8% in 2022. Forrester projects U.S. ad spending to grow 4.6% in 2023 compared to an estimated 10.2% in 2022. Zenith expects the U.S. advertising spending to grow by $66 billion from 2022 to 2025. The U.S. market will account for nearly 44% of the global ad spending market size.Story continuesBIA Advisory Services estimates that the U.S. ad market will total around $165.7 billion in 2023. The absolute figure remains solid despite a 0.5% decline year over year. Finally, Statista forecasts that U.S. digital ad spending will increase by 13.9% year over year to $297.4 billion in 2023.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five advertising and marketing stocks that have strong growth potential for 2023.

(NYSE: FE) has demolished three emissions stacks at the former Hatfield's Ferry Power Station near Masontown, Pennsylvania, a key milestone in preparing the 236-acre site of the retired coal-fired plant for future development. FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)On March 4, a specialized demolition contractor used strategically placed charges around the bases of the three stacks, safely bringing them down in a controlled implosion. The twin stacks immediately adjacent to the boiler house stood about 700 feet tall. The other 540-foot stack, connected to the plant's environmental scrubbers, was the only one in operation at the time of Hatfield's closure in 2013.""The safe removal of the stacks is an important step in positioning this Greene County site for future economic productivity,"" said Samuel L. Belcher, senior vice president of Operations for FirstEnergy. ""Once demolition activities are complete, the site will feature attractive attributes for energy-intensive and water-intensive industries. Level tracts of vacant land along navigable rivers are a rarity in southwestern Pennsylvania.""FirstEnergy subsidiaries will continue to own and maintain the site as an open grassy area until a use is identified. This includes an operational high-voltage electric substation at the site, which would give a future business access to power from the regional transmission network. The property will also retain a water-intake structure on the Monongahela River.North American Dismantling Corporation (NADC), the primary demolition contractor, began work at the sprawling plant last year and has made significant headway, removing smaller structures and ductwork. Steel and other metals are hauled from the site for recycling. Power-generation turbines and other equipment are being removed from the boiler house and other buildings for reclamation.Demolition of the plant will also help eliminate a public safety risk. Break-ins and thefts have occurred at the plant, and trespassing could result in serious injury or death.Story continuesThe plant's two massive cement hyperbolic cooling towers are scheduled for demolition later this summer, followed by the boiler house in the fall. Demolition activities should be completed in early 2024.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate approximately 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Salesforce.com (CRM) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this customer-management software developer a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 23.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 32.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 14.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 13.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Salesforce.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 54.9% over the past month.Bottom LineSalesforce.com has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Salesforce.com is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While the stock has been gaining lately, the trend might continue since its earnings outlook is still improving.The rising trend in estimate revisions, which is a result of growing analyst optimism on the earnings prospects of this customer-management software developer, should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This insight is at the core of our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank.The five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.For Salesforce.com, strong agreement among the covering analysts in revising earnings estimates upward has resulted in meaningful improvement in consensus estimates for the next quarter and full year.The chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSCurrent-Quarter Estimate RevisionsThe earnings estimate of $1.59 per share for the current quarter represents a change of +62.24% from the number reported a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Salesforce.com has increased 61.63% over the last 30 days, as 13 estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revisions.Current-Year Estimate RevisionsThe company is expected to earn $6.96 per share for the full year, which represents a change of +32.82% from the prior-year number.There has been an encouraging trend in estimate revisions for the current year as well.

120,ccbc0d5f-0063-31c7-b9e6-16881ea8ebc6,CRM,2023-03-09,30 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-biggest-saas-companies-world-164842565.html,1678294122,STORY,"['NOW', 'ADBE', 'INTU', 'OKTA', 'RMD', 'CRM', 'DOCU', 'DDOG', 'NET', 'ZM', 'MDB', 'PAYX', 'TWLO', 'PTC', 'PLTR', 'HUBS', 'CRWD', 'ZS', 'SPLK', 'ADSK', 'VEEV', 'PAYC']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 30 biggest SaaS companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 10 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World. The software as a service (SaaS) industry is one of the hottest sectors in the technology sector right now. The growth of the Internet and connectivity in general has created new business models and allowed existing businesses to transform their operations and take advantage of external products and processes without having to deal with large capital investment for their own systems. This allows firms to streamline their daily processes such as human resources and payroll and take advantage of specialized services. At the same time, it generates new business models where entire businesses are set up to facilitate other businesses or professionals at carrying out their operations.These diverse use cases and the fact that the industry itself still hasn't fully matured lead to some optimistic valuations and growth estimates for the SaaS sector. One such estimate comes from Market Research Future, with the firm estimating that the SaaS industry is estimated to grow to $381 billion by the end of this decade from the start and through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3%. This growth and the strong valuation for a software subscription platform that does not have the luxury of high product prices like the hardware industry does is still unsurprising given that some of the biggest technology companies in the world such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) have dedicated cloud computing divisions. This growth is also fueled by the relatively easier adaptability of the SaaS platforms, as Market Research Future points out that firms find it easier to access complex software products via the cloud instead of spending heavily to develop such capabilities in house.Another more optimistic estimate for the SaaS industry comes from FinancialNewsMedia. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $121 billion in 2020 and from then until it will grow at a stronger CAGR of 18.8% to be worth $702 billion by the end of 2023.Story continuesHowever, despite these rosy estimates, the SaaS sector is still a technology industry and as such is subject to macroeconomic pitfalls. These days inflation and high interest rates are restricting corporate budgets and cloud computing spending is also dropping as a result. Yet, SaaS companies are adamant that their business is growing, with ServiceNow, Inc.

PG&amp;E's meteorology department is warning of another challenge for customers and PG&amp;E crews – flooding due to melting snow.""The upcoming storm will be a strong and much warmer event. Significant rain, which could total three to seven inches in the mountains, on top of the existing snowpack, will present flooding risks,"" said Scott Strenfel, PG&amp;E Director of Meteorology and Fire Science. ""The wind combined with heavy rain and flooding risks can lead to access issues for our crews if trees fail and roadways flood, which can result in longer outage durations for some customers.""Poised to respond to outages are PG&amp;E electric crews, troublemen, distribution line technicians and system inspectors who serve as the utility's first responders, along with personnel who will monitor electric incidents for public safety.In addition, PG&amp;E has opened its Emergency Operations Center and local operations emergency centers in impacted regions to more efficiently allocate crews, materials and other resources to restoration efforts. The company is using its storm outage prediction models that help determine the potential timing, location, and number of power outages. The models allow the company to have extra crews on standby to deploy to areas hard hit by the storm. PG&amp;E is also prestaging power poles, powerlines, transformers, and other electric equipment at yards throughout its service area to restore power to affected areas safely and as quickly as possible.Story continuesPredictions for Incoming WeatherWarmer and wet conditions are expected to return to the region Thursday as a moderately strong atmospheric river storm takes aim at the territory. Precipitation and wind then look to pick up in intensity Thursday afternoon and evening across Northern California and will spread southeast across the remainder of the state into early Friday.Moderate to heavy rainfall with breezy to gusty winds and possibly isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue through Friday. Winds, and thunderstorm threats will then diminish during the afternoon and evening, with scattered precipitation continuing into early Saturday.Snow levels look to raise above 5,000 feet across the North and possibly up to 8,000 to 10,000 feet across the central/southern Sierra Thursday evening into Friday. This could lead to a major snowmelt event across the state on top of flash flooding threats from new rainfall.Keeping Customers InformedCustomers can view real-time outage information at PG&amp;E's online outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email, or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action Center.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Robert Piconi.Story continuesRobert Allen PiconiLaurence, thank you, and thanks to everybody for joining the call today. Just a few weeks ago we finished our first year as a publicly listed company, a year that saw us launch in February while delivering our first $146 million in revenue throughout the year, $100 million of which was achieved in Q4 alone due to strong execution and customer focus by our people in our first start to deployments and project revenue. I was on the floor of the NYSE 2 weeks ago with Judy Shaw from the New York Stock Exchange, who was interviewing me for a year-in review perspective, as we have met the year before during the IPO. And it really struck me to step back and look at all that was accomplished.Starting the year, having strategic investors like Korea Zinc and Atlas Renewable step into the IPO with an additional $100 million of investment from the start to then immediately breaking ground on our first EVx gravity system outside of Shanghai in March 2022 for the highlights of the first quarter. Note that this first 25-megawatt, 100-megawatt-hour system once operating this year will be only 1 of 2 operating long-duration energy storage systems at this scale that is not a pump hydroelectric facility. And it really just shows you that the energy storage industry is still in its infancy, particularly for longer duration, which is in its own early development stages. We're really excited to show the world what we're capable of here as the EVx system comes online this year.Sticking with gravity, we broke ground in Snyder, Texas in September with Enel Green Power with our first U.S.-based EVx system. And we finished the year signing more territory expansions and license royalty agreement territories outside the United States, in Europe and the Middle East, all of which set the platform for future builds and subsequent high-margin royalty streams as the longer duration storage markets develop and become more important as renewables become a greater portion of our power generation.Turning to where there is much larger and immediate demand in the short duration energy storage market, our EVS team executed with velocity and quality and development of our energy management system, enabling the signing of about 1.6 gigawatt hours of battery, hybrid and green hydrogen energy storage projects with multiple regulated utility companies and some of the largest leading independent power players in the world. This is further proof that customers see and value not only our differentiation and unique hardware architectures and software design, but perhaps most importantly, they recognize the seasoned operational and prior energy storage project experience of our team, trusting us to deliver on very large scale and complex projects as we will be turning over this year. The type of customers that we are working with do not take risks on execution, full-stop. Their jobs are mission-critical, providing power and our energy storage needs, therefore, have to support that. And we are excited this year to turn over our first systems.Our current backlog and awarded contracts now exceeds 5 gigawatt hours and approximately $2 billion. And I could not be more proud in supporting the team here at Energy Vault. We set some benchmarks in 2022, while executing well with a strong Q4 finish, demonstrating significant market validation via our strategy across short, long and ultra-long-duration storage wins across multiple storage mediums, enabled through our software and innovative energy management system. And we look to continue to build upon this momentum in 2023.Let's spend a minute here on Q4. And regarding Q4, we announced our 2022 revenue of approximately $146 million, which is within the midpoint of our preannounced higher range of revenue with gross margins of approximately 16%, reflecting a mix of gravity license revenue from regional expansions in Europe and the Middle East and execution on battery-related projects in the United States.Our adjusted EBITDA of approximately negative $11.4 million was slightly under our prior guidance, driven by upticks in investments in employees in Q4 to support the aggressive projects ramping into 2023 as well as some compensation-related expense given the overperformance achieved in Q4 and the year. Jan Kees will be reviewing more financial details of the Q4 performance shortly.Before we get there, I do want to talk in some detail about the 2023 forecast, which I know many of you are very interested to understand. As we had already announced and preannounced a stronger-than-expected Q4 revenue, I would like to spend some time talking about that forecast. And before jumping into the specifics and our financial guidance, I first want to outline our framework and philosophical approach as we begin to share more financial details with investors, transitioning from a first year in 2022, marked by large contract wins, announcements and deployment starts with top utilities and global independent power providers to now in 2023 where we will be commissioning and turning over our first gravity and battery energy storage systems globally.Let me first talk a little bit about the shape of the year and how we see our progress ramping. As we saw in Q4 with a significant revenue upside achieved through executing ahead of schedule for a 275 megawatt hour California deployment, we continue to expect a level of lumpiness in our results, which could result in potential timing shift quarter-to-quarter and really not unusual at all given our stage of executing on our first deployments as a company. Our out-performance in the fourth quarter is expected to result in successive quarterly growth ramps starting low double-digit million revenue to high double-digit revenue into Q2 and getting quickly into triple-digit revenue quarter-over-quarter in the second half of the year. Our second half of 2023 will thus represent our largest quarterly revenues in Q3 and Q4, coincident with our first project turnovers as expected and for contractual commitments to a progressive build to our year based on contracted bookings from 2022.I want to talk a little bit about the macro factors and talk about how those could potentially impact our forecast as well. We are approaching the revenue forecast that we've given and specifically our cash and operating expense management with the level of tightness and conservatism as we prudently plan for: one, continued uncertainty in the macro interest rate inflationary environment and does general financial market volatility; two, the potential for further regional impact of COVID-related pandemic issues and work stoppages. Three, general supply chain and labor tightness. And four, the potential for geopolitical and unforeseen escalation that may occur.At the same time, and given our strong liquidity and cash position with no debt, we are well-positioned and poised to take advantage of the industry growth tailwinds for energy storage globally. And specific growth in economic accelerators in the U.S. market driven by the passage of the IRA. And we'll talk more about that in just a minute.Third, let's talk about how we're playing to our strengths. Compounding the momentum we're seeing across our business is our portfolio of proprietary and differentiated storage solutions that is unmatched in the market. And our unique ability to address short-, long- and ultra-long-duration needs across multiple customer use cases under the same asset management digital platform. The perspectives that we garner from our customers from their short-term shifting needs given peak demand cycles to fossil fuel asset retirement tied to longer-duration needs and even very specific regional needs for backup and microgrid solutions requiring ultra-long or multi-day storage are all contributing to fortify Energy Vault's role as a true strategic partner, helping our customers manage through this complexity. In fact, we're very proud to have recently had our energy management system selected by one of the largest U.S. public utilities over other current leading platforms, which we believe demonstrates our innovation, our advantaged economics, and the velocity of our Energy Vault Solutions team.Fourth, I'd like to talk about the IRA, which was really a game-changer to our industry and just really refreshing to see the United States lead in this area given the priority on solving the climate change problem. And first to note that we haven't baked any of its expected benefits into our current forecast. In the U.S. market, in particular, we uniquely can take direct advantage of the IRA monetizing, one, the ITC, which represents up to 50% CapEx reduction, thanks to our domestic content and project site in energy communities as defined.For our gravity projects in particular, given we can be 100% domestic content and for the projects that we initially own for gravity. But in addition, the advanced manufacturing credit, which is a $45 per kilowatt hour for our hybrid green hydrogen storage solutions that we integrate, deliver under EPC contracts. While the general energy storage market is made up of players that are more single-threaded in their technology and selling into broader growth trends, Energy Vault uniquely can capture significant direct benefits on top of the broader market growth for projects we may initially own. And we have optimized our strategy to do just that, pending the Treasury guidance that we expected forthcoming, especially with our gravity energy storage portfolio given its optimal positioning enabled through the IRA for the U.S. market.Just to remind, we are not currently including these benefits in our forecast for revenue, cash or margin as we await final guidance from the Treasury Department on the actual mechanics. But we strongly believe the legislation, as intended, can and will have significant benefits to our company in an outsized way.Fifth, I'd like to dig in a bit more on the unit economics for our business, which is an area that many of you have asked about as we began our project deployments in 2022. And as evidenced in our 2022 project wins, we will continue to generate higher returns than the industry average because we are continuing to focus on large projects with unique needs that we can match with our high-energy storage solutions from a megawatt hour per acre, high density, and more efficient design for augmentation, as was the case with batteries, no degradation in the storage medium as is the case for our gravity energy storage solution and for ultra-long-duration in small footprint as we did with our hybrid green hydrogen solution for PG&amp;E.Generally, this means a move from the mid- to high single gross margin percentages on our initial projects to mid-teen gross margin percentages across the board on all content and value added that we supply. And in fact, our 2023 gross margins will reflect this as our projection reflects of 10% to 15%. This includes allowing customers who wish to do so or if we strategically decide to contract directly with suppliers to pass through products such as battery packages and utilize the Energy Vault to deliver our proprietary hardware architecture across the gravity, battery and hybrid systems, coupled with our energy management system.Importantly, our business model and approach, flexible to be able to adapt to each specific customer and project whether customers choose to procure batteries on their own or not, for example. This may result in lower total revenues for some projects, but importantly, in those cases, we will be exclusively focused on the higher-margin opportunity set associated with the project development, which we target in the mid-teens to 20% margin range.While our revenue will be growing in the 2 to 3x range year-over-year, we are holding our operating expense flat off of our annualized Q4 2022 run rate as we exit the year. This will allow us the potential to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 as we exit the year, assuming that we execute within the high end of the revenue range, and perhaps more importantly, allow us subsequently to enter 2024 on pace to achieve positive operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024 results.Now back to the specific 2023 guidance that we highlighted in our earnings announcement sent out just 30 minutes ago. We hold all of the factors above to influence our 2023 outlook, but have taken a very conservative baseline approach that we're adopting in how we forecast our business and felt it most prudent to take a very measured approach to 2023, especially given the significant second half revenue ramp that constitutes our range of $325 million to $425 million for the year. At the low end, our updated 2023 revenue forecast of $325 million reflects only contracted revenues already under execution with planned CODs within 2023. At the upper end of our range captures the potential associated with projects forecasted to be placed in service later in the year. Some pending gravity and technology portfolio license agreements that are underway, other territory expansions and other potential projects within the short listing or submission phase of our sales funnel.Importantly, we'd emphasize that even at the high end we have adopted a level of conservatism that does not full capture the various projects and discussions our team is working on. We plan to update this and refine this range throughout the year as we gain greater visibility on the development and completion of our large-scale projects. Additionally, as I noted earlier, our forecast does not assume any benefits as well from the pending IRA legislation pending the Treasury guidance.Based upon the revenue forecast above and projects contracted and under development and deployment, we are projecting gross margins in the range of 10% to 15% for 2023. This expected gross margin outcome reflects the blend across our wide-ranging project slate, including gravity, battery and hybrid green hydrogen projects. Further, we believe it evidences our thoughtful approach to managing returns of our business, as well as our ability to remain nimble and flexible in developing the right solution to our customer's energy storage needs.As mentioned above, we are holding our OpEx, our total operating expense relatively flat to our fourth quarter 2022 annualized run rate, given the growth investments made in 2022. While this might be surprising, given the 2 to 3x revenue ramp from 2022 to 2023, we believe this will enable more flexibility as we ramp the year and ability to continue to invest in the most attractive opportunities that prevent themselves. Taken together, we're currently forecasting adjusted EBITDA in the range of minus $50 million to $70 million in 2023. Importantly, however, there is a significant amount of leverage within our range as we ramp into the second half of the year of between minus $15 million to positive $1.1 million, allowing us to potentially be adjusted EBITDA positive as we exit the year if revenue approaches the higher end of the range and thus entering 2024 with a platform for positive operating cash flow.One thing I want to iterate here at the end of some of the specific guidance is our primary focus for this year, which really hasn't changed on our focus from last year, which is executing to customer needs. This year becomes even more critical in that regard as we will be turning over our first systems to customers and demonstrating not only our innovation and the development of technology, our innovation and execution capabilities to deliver on time and on budget, but delivering a quality technical performance and operating performance for our customers for our initial gravity and battery energy storage systems that will be delivered and turned over this year.I want to talk also a little bit now about EVx and turning to some project-specific progress updates. Let's start in China, which is where we broke ground in March of last year with the first 100 megawatt hour system. And China continues to progress. And this success is leading to more opportunities for us in the Asia market, as you may have seen announced. I'm really proud of the Atlas Renewable and the team from China Tianying as they worked through 2 long COVID-related shutdowns, in particular in the Shanghai area, which is where Rudong is located, approximately 45 minutes outside of Shanghai. We've included in the investor presentation some additional pictures from Rudong. And you can see the extraordinary progress being made in such a short period of time.This is also further validation of EVx's economic and technological viability. In a few short years from 2017 and '18, when we built the first 5-megawatt system in Switzerland, we have been able to develop the new EVx system and a new form factor, leveraging all of what was proven in Switzerland with a 5 megawatt system to an interconnected grid system and to now to be close to be commercially developed in our first 25 megawatt and 100 megawatt hour unit in Rudong, China, that, as I mentioned earlier, will be one of the first systems in the world in long duration at that scale that's not pumped hydro. We continue to be very excited about that and excited also about what we're implementing in that system.Let me give you a little bit of a higher level of context as well as we see the present and future market segments for our EVx and how we are maximizing our opportunities for success. Let's start by segmenting the EVx market into 2 end-use types. The first segment is the utility grid uses and the second being the industrial and microgrid uses. The first segment for utility grids continues to be heavily biased in the current time to shorter duration needs and use cases that are currently being served as we are serving them with lithium-ion solutions.As time goes by and renewable power reaches a larger percentage of the overall power pool, the need for long duration will drive broader adoption of solutions like EVx in broader deployments. And to address these market realities for establishing strategic relations early on with these same utilities that we're currently integrating some of the shorter-duration projects where we've gained installed footprint. Our strategy is to expand these relationships in the future to include the EVx as their long-duration storage needs emerge and progress. And in fact, most of the utilities we're working with have those needs as they were shutting down some of their existing fossil fuel assets over time and will require longer duration storage solutions at the end of the existing grid.Shifting to the industrial and microgrid applications, we see a lot of strong interest today that requires durations of 8 to 12 hour and use cases accordingly and are not well-suited for existing shorter-duration technologies like lithium-ion. We've talked a lot about our metals and mining investors and operations are great examples as they electrify their operations, and this has enabled us to work with our strategic partners such as Korea Zinc and BHP to develop ways to implement the EVx to decarbonize their operations. Other segments such as green hydrogen that are emerging as well as the strong demand required to meet the need for sustainable aviation fuel, which is a market that we believe is going to be in the multibillions in the coming 5 to 10 years. In parallel with how we are addressing these segments, we are also executing 3 initiatives for us to extract both near-term and longer-term economic benefits from EVx. The first, as you might expect, is our continued cost reduction programs.With the feedback design and construction of the EVx in Rudong, China, which follows all the learnings from Switzerland on our first grid-interconnected 5 megawatt system in our Arbedo-Castione, coupled again with the R&amp;D efforts with our team in Switzerland and the United States led by Andrea Pedretti and Chris Wiese, we continue to design, test and validate the latest innovations to increase the economics of the EVx system. This includes leadership from Dr. Jose Andrade, who was a former PhD and Head of the seismic studies department at Caltech and joined us over 1 year ago, bringing tremendous expertise and research to help us continue to optimize the performance of that system.I'm also pleased to share with you that we have retained the services of William Baker, the renowned engineer of the Burj Khalifa Tower in Dubai, which is the world's largest building at the height of over 2,700 feet. Bill will be applying his past expertise in development of the world's most innovative high-rise structures to our optimization efforts, but also to specific customer opportunities where his presence and expertise will be welcomed and will also help us accelerate the permitting of the existing range of height of our structures and the potential to even accelerate those same heights of those same structures. Within our gravity focus, we have a team that's supported by over 70 team members. And we're excited to see the development they are able to make throughout 2023 and look forward to share the details of their progress in the coming quarters.Another initiative associated with our EVx systems, as we previously announced, our continued licenses and royalty programs that give us the opportunity for attractive recurring revenue at very high margins that will materially and positively impact our overall company blended margins. In addition to the announced opportunities in China and the follow-on opportunities alone in China of up to 6 gigawatt hours as have been announced in the last 6 to 8 months, I am pleased to announce today 2 new EVx licensing partners in CITC based in the UAE for Egypt and also [New Energy Keepers] based in Greece to also develop the Cypress market, which were signed in the fourth quarter. We will continue to pursue these types of businesses globally to make EVx a meaningful margin contributor to the bottom line today while bridging to the future state of broader market adoption of longer-duration systems as the grid develops with more renewable power generation and therefore the need to address the increased intermittency that comes with renewables.The third initiative is leveraging the IRA as another amplifier and accelerator for our EVx business within the United States, as we've discussed above. And perhaps globally, as other nations and even regions may follow suit on the leadership the U.S. has provided in developing incentives to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and renewable storage. While the legislation has not yet been fully defined at a detailed implementation level, we believe that it will come to market more or less in the same form and function as currently understood. We currently believe that both the advanced manufacturing credit and project investment tax credits could significantly and positively impact the economics of the EVx in particular for the coming years. We believe that the local manufacturing construction of EVx would make it suitable to receive advanced manufacturing credits of perhaps as much as $45 a kilowatt hour.An attractive design and draw of the EVx is the ability to locally source material and label that would enable the system to take advantage of many of the domestic content portions of the ITC as well. You can expect a lot of focus and continued updates in this regard on EVx, the U.S. market and development of the IRA in the coming quarters.Just to highlight a few of the commercial activities and progress as we came out of Q4. We have 1.6 gigawatt hour of signed contracts and booked orders in the backlog. This is a more than 3x increase from the third quarter of 2022 where we exited with 495 megawatt hour. This includes 275 megawatt hour with Wellhead Electric, 220 megawatt hour with Jupiter Power, which was acquired by BlackRock Infrastructure in Q4, 440 megawatt hour with Nevada Energy and up to 700 megawatt hour with PG&amp;E in California.Our submitted proposal pipeline grew more than 50% quarter-over-quarter as energy storage demands and needs as we see, remain robust and we remain with a seat at the table in making proposals. Our awarded category shifted by approximately 17% for the quarter-over-quarter, driven by positive factors as projects were converted that were sitting in the awarded category into booked orders.As I mentioned before, the primary focus of 2023 will be on project execution. We are currently on track to deliver all of our signed projects on time, and our team is working very hard to navigate the supply chain, permitting and interconnection delays that are prevalent in the industry, but thus far have been able to manage through and working both with our customers and with our supply chain partners. Given the rapid pace that we are seeing with the energy transition and all the unique use cases and solutions required to meet our customer needs, we continue to believe our differentiated holistic solutions-based energy storage approach is the best one suited for this market and will set up Energy Vault for a very large and unique future as a major leading player over the next 5 to 10 years.One last comment on the project we signed with PG&amp;E for hybrid green hydrogen plus battery storage solution in January really showcases the differing needs of our customers and our ability to deliver on them. In this case, and this is the case in California, they needed a product which could provide a minimum of 48-hour-long duration energy storage to address needs in the event of a power safety shutdown as was evidenced by the wildfires that impacted the utility industry in California some years back. But they also required black start and grid forming capabilities in the event that there was a public safety shutoff event. And given our technology-agnostic approach with our software, we were able to engineer, design, integrate and will, in the future, operate the system with our proprietary software that will actually enable up to 700 megawatt hour or almost 4 days of long-duration energy storage. We're very excited to bring and demonstrate and showcase our broad technology expertise to be able to design and architect this solution with our partners and to progress on this project to completion planned in the second quarter of 2024 and to continue an even broaden this partnership with PG&amp;E and the city of Calistoga.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jan Kees van Gaalen, who can provide more details into our financial results from Q4.Jan Kees van GaalenThanks, Rob.Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue in the quarter was $100.3 million, primarily reflecting $84.5 million in revenue earned from our battery storage projects and $15.6 million from EVx licensing deals. Wellhead construction began in Q4, and we began recognizing revenue for that project during the quarter. Revenue from Wellhead drove battery storage project revenue during the fourth quarter.Licensing revenue in the fourth quarter was driven by $9.7 million in revenue from the Egypt EVx licensing deal and $5.9 million from the Atlas licensing deal. For the full year 2022, Revenue was $145.9 million, primarily reflecting $85.6 million in revenue earned from our battery storage projects and $58.5 million from EVx licensing deals. Fourth quarter 2022 gross profit was $15.9 million, driven by licensing revenue recognized during the quarter, bringing full year 2022 gross profit to $59.3 million. Total operating expenses, excluding cost of sales, were $41.7 million in Q4, up $5.4 million versus the $36.3 million we reported in Q3 of this year.Stock-based compensation was $14.3 million in Q4, up $3.4 million versus Q3 2022. Depreciation expense in Q4 was $0.2 million compared to $5.2 million in Q3. Excluding these noncash charges, operating expenses were up $7 million versus the third quarter, mainly driven by an increase in headcount. This brings total operating expenses to $122.4 million in 2022 and $81.3 million if we exclude stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing costs for the first -- for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $4.3 million compared to $3.8 million in Q3 of this year. Excluding stock-based compensation, sales and marketing expenses were up $0.6 million sequentially.2022 total sales and marketing costs were $12.6 million. Excluding stock-based compensation, sales and marketing expenses were up $6.7 million year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in head count and an increase in marketing and public relations costs.Now turning to research and development costs. For the fourth quarter of 2022 they were $13.9 million compared to $16.7 million in the third quarter of this year. Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, R&amp;D expenses were up $2.7 million versus Q3, driven by an increase in R&amp;D activities and STIP that accounted for $1.9 million. Total R&amp;D expenses for the year were $50.1 million, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation. R&amp;D expenses were up $20.3 million versus 2021, primarily due to higher R&amp;D activity levels. G&amp;A for the fourth quarter increased to $23.5 million compared to $13 million in Q3 of this year. Excluding stock-based compensation, G&amp;A was up $6.6 million versus Q3, driven primarily by an increase in headcount, with STIP accounting for $3.5 million of the $6.6 million increase. Year-over-year, G&amp;A increased from $18.1 million in 2021 to $56.9 million in 2022.In line with our business plan, we will exercise continued focus on our operating expenses as we selectively expand globally and position the company for the overall growth of the business. Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $25.7 million compared to an operating loss of $36 million sequentially. This brings total operating loss for 2022 to $63.1 million. Fourth quarter '22 adjusted EBITDA was negative $11.2 million, bringing total full year '22 adjusted EBITDA to a negative $11.4 million in 2022. Our earnings release, which we filed this afternoon includes a bridge from net income to adjusted EBITDA. The key noncash or nonrecurring items that we added back were $41.1 million of stock-based compensation, $20.6 million in merger transaction costs, $7.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense and $2.8 million in asset impairment charges. The key noncash or nonrecurring items that we deducted were $3.7 million in interest income net and $2.3 million gain from the change in the fair value of our warrants.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $286.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, leaving us well positioned to continue to progress towards our growth objectives in '23 and beyond. As of December 31, 2022, we still have $5.1 million outstanding private warrants, which are required to be remeasured to fair value each period.I would like to reiterate the 2023 financial guidance that Rob introduced earlier in the call. For 2023, we expect revenue guidance to be in the range of $325 million to $425 million. Our latest forecast reflects more than doubling year-over-year growth at the midpoint, evidencing the strong commercial and financial momentum our team continues to achieve. With that said, our 2023 guidance reflects a more conservative approach to our financial expectation for the year. We have taken a philosophical relook at how we forecast our business better, to better-account for the inherent lumpiness associated with our large-scale projects and their development, compounded by the back-end weighted nature of our expected financial results this year. We remain relentlessly focused on continued measured growth of our infrastructure and organization to further results of our business and that of our customers. We will also target adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $50 million and negative $70 million with year-over-year difference, a result of the change in revenue mix as we roll off the margin tailwinds from the licensing and royalty deal signed in the first quarter of 2022. And as we continue to build and develop our infrastructure, hiring key resources for the delivery of our projects and expanding in international markets.And with this, I will now turn the call back over to Rob.Robert Allen PiconiThank you, Jan Kees. And I would like to also welcome and thank Jan Kees for his first quarter under his belt here at Energy Vault. And he's a great addition to our team. And as we're looking at the business, given the growth, we're going to be taking on his global experience let alone his length of tenure across multiple public companies across the world is going to serve us very well.Jan Kees van GaalenThank you.Robert Allen PiconiLook here, we're at the end of the call. A few things I want to reiterate here before we turn it over for questions and a few data points I'll point to. We really tried at this point as we're digging into the forecast for this year to begin to share more information as we now have more visibility with executed contracts and booked orders. And a few data points I want to highlight and reiterate with you. One is on the funnel metrics. We shifted to a more near-term 12-month funnel approach and segmented it in 4 sections. There is a page within our investor deck that's on the website that summarizes that funnel. I want to point you to a 50% increase in the number of proposal submissions that we've made from 13 gigawatt hour last quarter, now up to 20 gigawatt hour, which is a massive number. I think it's a great leading indicator of what's to come. Not suggesting we're going to be batting 1,000 on those or win all of them. But you can count on the fact that we're going to win some of them. And I think that's a great leading indicator on that front end of that funnel as we move from those submitted proposals to shortlist to project awards and then into bookings. And we've, I think, demonstrated an ability to move that forward with velocity.The other thing I want to highlight, as Jan Kees mentioned right at the end of his review of the results, is liquidity. I think we're in just a fantastic position with no debt on the balance sheet and finishing with actually growing cash quarter-over-quarter is just a fantastic data point and puts us in a great position to now, as we evolve the business, entertain and have discussions as we are to get surety and bonding capacity, for example, for these larger projects and with non-collateralized solutions. So really avoiding letters of credit that require us to restrict cash, but we're working in a very positive way with Marsh, which is one of the largest players in the United States, and bringing solutions together for noncollateralized bonding capacity as well as noncollateralized letters of credit. And that's going to serve us well as we will not restrict cash on our balance sheet.The other thing that I want to highlight and emphasize is, for the first time we shared information about our gross margins and unit economics but also spent some time about our philosophical approach to how we contract our deals and the blend of our portfolio as well as the mix across customers that we work with where they want us to integrate 100% through our books of all the third-party equipment and others where we choose not to and focus on the integration component. We're very sensitive about that because we want the highest returns on the work we're doing. It demonstrates value. We should be generating the high returns on what we're doing that shows we are differentiated. And in some cases can command a price and even a premium because of the nature of that differentiation. So it's a very important strategic area for us. It is an incentive for the entire company. So gross margin performance is one of the key incentives this year tied to compensation of our executive team and all of the employees in the company.I also want to highlight here at the end that hopefully you can appreciate a much more conservative nature a bit and as we look at our forecast for 2023. And this is just a function of, one, the world we live in as 2022 demonstrated as the last few years. We joke with the team a bit that as we sit here today, we know that as we sit here a year from now we're going to look back and see that the year went completely different than we thought. Obviously certain things we know will go as we expect them to in terms of delivery to our customers of projects underway. But in terms of what we're going to book this year, the new things that pop into our funnel that we don't see today, maybe some things would fall out. We're very excited about that, and we'll continue to capitalize what we believe is a very differentiated solution. However, we have taken an approach and have attempted to share with a lot of you on this call, being sensitive to factors that are a part also of our current growth phase of the company. We're turning over first projects. We're going to be starting more projects the second half of the year. This is the first year we're turning over projects and systems. And so there are certain things we outlined that I encourage you to think about and hopefully appreciate as that's reflected in the current forecast we've given. We feel very, very good about the low end of that forecast because it's made up of what's already contracted and booked. And we feel very good about where we are in that execution. And thus, we feel very good about executing toward the higher end of that forecast.And as we mentioned, there are certain things that are not included in that forecast like the potential benefits, which we believe will be positive of the IRA legislation. Finally, I just want to always thank the employees of this company where our days begin and end every day. I cannot be more humbled and excited about continuing to support this team. We do not limit our thinking because of the talent that we attract to this company, which is why in Q4 you saw us continue to add at a little greater rate to set ourselves up well for good execution here in 2023 to deliver on our goals. And we will continue to make strategic adjustments and strategic additions to the team as we evolve the company.With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We take our first question from the line of Thomas Boyes with TD Cowen.Thomas Gordon BoyesGreat to see the progress, especially on the gravity storage front with the additional licensing agreements. I just wonder if you could dig a little bit deeper there on just how they're structured? Is this going to be similar to the agreement that you used in China? I think I remember a $15 million licensing payment that was associated with that agreement. Could you just kind of walk us through some of the mechanisms there? That would be great.Robert Allen PiconiSure. The structure of those agreements, number one, varies depending on a few factors, some that would include exclusivity. Some of them are structured over years that could be as short as 7.5 years as an example and up to 10 years plus. So they'll vary both in length of time, inclusion of certain terms like exclusivity and also in payment structures. But generally, what is common across them is there is a license component that is paid, that is typically tied only to the right to deploy the technology. So that is not tied to volume deployment. Typically, that license, and it would be the case here, would involve an exclusivity for these regions. That exclusivity comes though with commitments on volume to retain that exclusivity regardless of the license payment. So that's required in any event. And then following that as deployments get started in those regions, comes a royalty stream. We've been public with the royalty percentage as a part of our first deal, which is 5% on total project revenue on volume deployments. And we -- essentially, from these new agreements, you can expect that they would be in that same range.Thomas Gordon BoyesPerfect. That's very helpful. And then maybe just as my second, it sounds like obviously to a certain degree, you're still going to be procuring battery storage hardware for some of your customers. Can you talk about the sourcing strategy there? Or how far are you looking to contract supply? Are you contracted throughout for 2023 for projects that you are being required to deliver on now? Or are you even looking further out?Robert Allen PiconiSure. We have a few different approaches relative to working with our customers on battery deployments. First of all, like with everything we do, we seek to innovate and differentiate around how we think about deployment, integration, software performance and optimization around the economics for our customers. So fundamentally, it really starts there. And if you look at the first deals we've won, they were not because we had the lowest price. In one of the cases, it was because we were able to achieve an energy density that was not able to be achieved by any competitor, and this was specific to the Wellhead deal in Stanton, where they needed to generate a little over 68 megawatts, but current solutions would only allow them to generate 50 megawatts over a 4-hour period. So that's one example. Another example is PG&amp;E where we integrated and responded to a proposal that didn't envision a renewable solution to solve a problem that could have only been solved with natural gas, for example, for multi-day storage. We developed a solution to integrate batteries with green hydrogen in that case to provide renewable solutions. So I would say, first of all, we -- from a battery and sourcing perspective, we work on ways to innovate with our hardware architecture and unique designs for optimization, whether that be with energy density, that could be with performance, that could be with safety. So ways that with our specific architectures, if there is a shutdown, for example, we can enable ongoing performance of a system, even if some specific modules may be shut down. That's not the case in a lot of battery systems where if there is a fire or a safety problem, the entire system shuts down. So there's a level of differentiation we look to achieve in implementation and that impacts our sourcing. Our team is led by Akshay Ladwa, who is based on the East Coast with our Energy Vault Solutions team, spend significant time with battery suppliers and looking at qualifying even new and upcoming suppliers to focus on differentiation of their specific cell development in batteries with our hardware design and our software design to deliver potential performance benefits that don't exist in the market. So our sourcing strategy will involve some of that direct engagement with suppliers that may not be, for example, some of the largest names in the world. So we work, I would say, with and develop with a few suppliers to try to tie differentiation into our solutions. The other way we work with customers, in some cases is with customers that have pre-existing relationships with very large battery suppliers. And in some cases, they may even dictate the choice of that battery supplier. In which case, we may choose, as we have been chosen, to be an integrator directly and work directly with that customer-chosen supplier or, and we referenced this on our earnings today, we may work with that supplier and integrate their solution but have it directly procured by the customer, in which case the customer takes the risk on the working capital on delivery, any associated liquidated damages, et cetera. And as I said, we talked a little bit about that today. So the last thing I'd share about, our sourcing strategy for batteries, which is very important, is we are not standing by and just waiting for domestic battery production to come in the United States. We are evaluating the players that are looking to build in the United States. We are active, not just as a potential customer, but as a potential participant in the development of that value chain. We're there because we believe that can be valuable to achieve some sustainable differentiation in terms of both availability and pricing and therefore margin as the domestic supply chain will now be developed very aggressively given the incentives under the IRA. And we'll be sharing publicly here in the very near term some of the results of some of those efforts. So I'd say across those -- that portfolio of areas of battery suppliers is how we're currently working and developing in with in what today is 95% of all energy storage that is being deployed is shorter duration lithium-ion battery. And let's not forget that.Thomas Gordon BoyesExcellent. No, I really appreciate the insight. I'll drop back in queue. If I could just sneak one more in. Just for the domestic sourcing that you're talking to for lithium-ion batteries. Do you have a sense on when that type of capacity would be coming online? Is that a 2025 event, do you think? Or could that happen quicker?Robert Allen PiconiWe're seeing some coming online as early as the second half of 2024, but in real volumes, 2025-plus. So that's from our work in the sector and working with players that are looking to build roughly what we see.OperatorWe take the next question from the line of Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners.Joseph Amil OshaTwo questions. First, I greatly appreciate the detail in terms of the composition of revenue in the fourth quarter. Looking into 2023, it kind of broadly seems like there are 3 buckets. You've got your BESS revenue. You've got anything that might potentially come from delivery of EVx systems and then EVx licensing. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how 2023 revenue might fall into those buckets, assuming that I'm thinking of it correctly.Robert Allen PiconiSure. Yes, I think you've got the right buckets there. And there's a sort of a fourth bucket that I can give you a little bit of a flavor of, Joe. I think as we've announced, we have 3 larger shorter duration projects that are going to be turned over in 2023 that make up a good chunk of that revenue on the battery side. And when I say batteries, some of those are hybrid-related systems but include lithium-ion battery. For EVx and EVx licensing, we're expecting to continue, let me start with the licenses, we're expecting to continue to develop, in particular, in the international markets, obviously we don't expect this in the U.S., for example. But given EVx is a, primarily a building, right, a foundation of fixed frame lifting systems and power electronics, because of the local nature of that and the local suppliers that have to deploy that in local EPC companies, the licensing model is a very interesting business model for us. It also enables us to give the flexibility to the local suppliers without us having to invest in local feet on the street and infrastructure. They are the most knowledgeable in any event, based on the type of construction this is. It is, as you know, primarily a local build. And that model and allowing for domestic jobs and domestic content, which as we know in the market, most countries are trying to pursue independence in energy, and that means energy storage if they're going to use renewables. So the model we're finding is a lot of interest in this model, which is, let's say, beneficial for both sides and creates a platform for future and very high-margin royalty streams to come as things get deployed. So we are expecting to have a percentage of our revenue. I wouldn't say it's a large percentage. For example, it's not going to be triple-digit million, although I never rule some large deals that comes as we had with Atlas Renewables, for example. But that will be a -- you can consider it something that most likely could be a double-digit million type of revenue stream in 2023. Let me talk about EVx. Interestingly, our first EVx deployments either are going to be done through the royalty license agreement model as Atlas is building out or projects that we are going to own initially in particular in the U.S. market, where, as I mentioned, Joe, we see a lot of interesting upside from the IRA tied to gravity because it's on lithium for all the things I mentioned on the call that I know you know very well about the benefits of that and the economics that the IRA can help accelerate and create. So our ability to develop those projects, find points of interconnection and now, I think, a way to monetize EVx in an accelerated way as long-duration needs become more prevalent is going to be very interesting. However, for this year, for 2023, given the nature of both the licensing side as well as the ownership of systems, initially, for example, we were looking at ENEL as something that was going to be our standard EPC. And that has shifted to a project we're actually going to own, for other reasons, that has a lot of benefits for us, I think, on the -- from a potential IRA perspective, and because it's a first system with -- and with the ITCs. But what that does mean as revenue recognition obviously is going to come later in a tolling agreement, so after we build it. So you aren't going to see revenue impact on that in the United States this year. So those are on the 3 questions you raised. I would share that as you think about systems like what we announced, for example, with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric or hybrid systems, unique things we're doing that the PG&amp;E system is one has announced that we're owning as an example. And in those cases, we definitely plan to get those projects developed and built. We may convert those to where we're into an EPC agreement where we build them. In all cases, we will be the asset manager which is interesting. And at another -- we'll schedule another call, I think, with you, to take you through a little bit of our thinking around the asset management space. But that is an area of growth and an area that we're definitely going to be a player in relative to operating systems on behalf of large IPPs or on behalf of large infrastructure funds. So that would be just an area that I just tease you a little bit relative to something that we've already announced and will be developed as we progress the year.Joseph Amil OshaOkay. And just a quick much shorter follow up on the IRA. One thing that we've heard some BES system integrators talk about is the idea of not making cells on store necessarily, but potentially doing pack assembly, right? And there is a manufacturing tax credit associated with that. Any thoughts on whether we might see Energy Vault involved in battery pack manufacturing in the U.S.?Robert Allen PiconiOkay. Sorry, I was just -- your question is specifically in and around just assembling integration in the United States versus actual manufacturing?Joseph Amil OshaWell, no, no, pack manufacturing because there's a cell credit and then there's a pack -- there's a module credit, right? And so we've seen some -- one of your competitors, for example, talk about sourcing cells, but actually doing module assembly in the U.S. where there is an associated credit.Robert Allen PiconiOkay. Sorry about that. Yes, I understand the question. So the answer is yes, in terms of our involvement. And we had announced, as an example, with Jupiter Power, an agreement to work with them, it was 2.4 gigawatt hour of sourcing that we announced to work with them on around domestic content that will be up to and including looking at leveraging the energy communities' aspect but as well as sourcing, whether that be in the direct manufacturing area or in the packaging and integration area.OperatorWe'll take a next question from the line of Chris Ellinghaus with Siebert Williams Shank.Christopher Ronald EllinghausRob, can you talk about the change in the 2-year revenue guidance and sort of how you have made that more conservative in terms of your view of revenue recognition for this year?Robert Allen PiconiSure. Yes, there were 3 main factors that I tried to be as explicit as I could in the announcement. So one of them had to do initially with just our acceleration from what was planned in Q1 this year and due to faster execution went into Q4 of an amount of revenue. So that was one impact that we entered the year with. Secondly, and this is the primary impact, has to do with a very large customer that is roughly about a gigawatt hour that initially we were going to be integrating the entire scope through our balance sheet. So as a project where we would contract directly, for example, for the battery packages, in particular. What we chose to do with that customer is have the customer contract directly for that portion of the equipment. We are still the integrator, for example, of that solution and other aspects of balance of plant. So it's still a very large deal for us. But as you know, I believe the battery modules themselves typically would make up anywhere from 55% to up to 70% of these deals. So if you remove that, while that's going to reduce the revenue, what's very interesting about that for us is it means the mid- to high teens in gross margins for us, which we're very happy to do. I've mentioned this on an earlier question I had about our battery sourcing strategy, but generally if it's a certain supplier that we're working with where we're including differentiation and how we optimize the solution, which means, I'll translate that differentiation, lower cost for us and therefore generally higher margin for an integrated solution that we own all components of. There are customers that have existing relationships, and they're with very large, some of the largest battery players, where there's not a lot of value add we put on top beyond being a single throat to choke from the customer. So specifically, the second area, back to your question of with the revenue, the 2-year revenue, it was specifically that primary gap, I mean, almost that entire gap was just related to the choice for us to focus on an integrated and balance of plant capability and scope versus the battery aspect of it. And there is a third factor that we hit on here is we have a massive second half ramp coming in the business in terms of we're turning over almost a gigawatt hour of systems in the second half. 2 of those actually in Q3 plan and then a larger one in Q4. In addition, we're going to be starting projects. And so as you know can happen, especially if you have a large part of your revenue that's in the fourth quarter, as an example, as we do this year, we have a triple-digit million revenue in Q4 this year. If anything moves a little bit, we just wanted to safeguard if there was any portion of revenue that should shift from Q4 to Q1, which we haven't lost anything. It just means something shifts a quarter. We took a little more conservative approach in terms of as we looked at full revenue recognition in that quarter, even for things that are contracted. So it's the second half ramp of this year that we wanted to provide a level of both visibility as I'm doing now and transparency on that revenue. And therefore, coming up with something that I'd say we feel extremely comfortable with our low to even the mid part of our range we provided because of where we stand with visibility and where we are with customers, we're also quite confident about executing well as we did last year. Just to share an example, we contracted in the summer last year, in July and August last year, so actually signed deals. One of those deals that we signed that we signed in August ended up with over $80 million of revenue in Q4 last year. So within 4 months, we actually were able to recognize revenue on almost $80 million. And we didn't contract those and book those until the summer. So now am I saying we're going to do that every time, am I saying we're going to -- things are going to execute ahead of plan every time? No. So I'm sharing that level of detail with you so you know that while we've taken a more conservative approach, as we've outlined on this call, in particular, given the second half ramp, we're confident in our ability to execute to the mid- to upper part of that range. And as I said, with IRA and given what we did in our first year of almost $150 million of revenue and 2 gigawatt hours in book deals and up to 5 in awards total of booked and awards, we have a lot, I think we're going to be able to do in the year regardless.OperatorWe'll take the next question from the line of Brian Dobson with Chardan Capital Markets.Brian H. DobsonSo just returning to the guidance issue for 2023. As you're thinking about it, would you say it's fair to characterize, call it, the bottom half of your guidance as a conservative approach in that there is a potential for revenue slip into 2024 and that you're fairly confident as things stand right now that you could be at the mid to high end?Robert Allen PiconiYes. I would say that's roughly right. We started with a buildup approach of a low end that is booked and we're executing toward and as I mentioned, on track and on schedule to deliver. So that we consider in the bank. And as you move to that mid part and even to the upper part of the range, we have things in play that are well in hand to get there, again leave the IRA aside. So I realize that this may appear as obviously lower than what, in some cases, expectation with something up to $500 million this year as we looked at our 2-year view before. I mentioned the one deal where we're taking a much lower part of the content, but higher gross margin, which I think is important. But yes, I think your characterization and in terms of the lower end of the range, we feel obviously quite good about given the nature of where it started from. And then I think a very strong confidence in getting the mid- to upper part of that range here as we progress a year. And our view on that is to also with every quarter we're going to be much more knowledgeable. We're going to have another 60 to 90 days of bookings, of seeing how we're executing and seeing things that pop in maybe that we didn't even see that could be things we could turn around for rev rec in year. So we designed the forecast to essentially every quarter tighten that range up and just build that range. And obviously, in an ideal world, you -- because of the nature of being conservative here, is that we're going to be able to tighten to the mid- to higher end of that range with every quarter. That was the intention of how we built this forecast. And obviously, as we get into the second half of the year, be executing strongly toward, ideally toward the higher end. And if the IRA things come in as planned, I think we're going to have an excellent year.Brian H. DobsonRight. Understood. And I understand your desire not to include IRA benefits in the guidance range. But do you think you could potentially perhaps draw a range around what that could potentially look like?Robert Allen PiconiYes I would say we have 2 projects in particular that could garner some benefits and even in the year, depending on the way the Treasury mechanics come out. So I would say there are some benefits that are definitely in the double-digit millions of benefit. Now how much could we get in the year versus would go into 2024? That's another question. There are ways to monetize those benefits earlier. So I would say -- if I had to tell you today and assuming the IRA come through, there may be more cash-related benefits this year versus revenue recognition benefit, okay? Those revenue recognition benefits may come next year. But given, I think, some of the alternative structures we're going to look at and taking advantage of it, we may very well see a good, strong double-digit million type of cash benefit potentially this year that we wouldn't have in our forecast. And of course we like that. We like the cash flexibility. And we, as I said, we're trying to be now as we have more information and data, be more transparent and sharing with the market so people would understand that we're very happy to take the cash even if the revenue recognition may come later. So those benefits, anything that gets in double-digit million is significant. I think whether that's cash or even potential rev rec.Brian H. DobsonYes. That's helpful. And then just stepping away from the mechanics of the guidance for a moment and taking, I'd call it, a 30,000-foot view. As you look around the world at different regions, where do you see the most opportunity? Which regions are you most excited about?Robert Allen PiconiSure. Well, I have to start in the U.S. because it's definitely -- with the IRA, I think the U.S. has done something to keep a lot of focus here. So that's -- I think that has a lot of upside and is one of the -- as you know, one of the largest storage markets. I think Australia is going to be an interesting and important market for us specifically because of the nature of some of our investors. Two of our largest investors have significant operations there. I think the green hydrogen market given its desire and requirement in electrolysis and running electrolyzers for long-duration storage. I think that market and where Australia is going to play a strong role there will be important. I think moving to the European theater, Scotland is ahead of the game and with its offshore wind investments generally. And I think there's large needs and I think a lot of opportunities there that we see as opportunities definitely for us. I'd say also, I'd be remised if I didn't talk about the Middle East, given what -- not only we've just announced with a license partner, but we're looking at the region very strategically for very large things. As you know, in the Middle East, nothing is done small. If it's done, it's large and it's done big. And I think as you're aware, we have Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures on our cap table. So I think that in that relationship and looking at now how we're thinking about leveraging that, I think that's very interesting to us. Our company has done some more recent development, I'd say there. And then I'd leave you with -- I think those are the primary main regions that we're excited about. We've announced some things in India that we continue to develop. We had announced an MOU with NTPC, which is the largest public utility and one of the largest power players there, I think, over 60 gigawatts of generation and a large coal plant infrastructure. So I think looking at alternatives to -- for uses of coal ash and ways we can use waste materials with our EVx, we have a few interactions there right now and looking at how we could deploy and deploy quickly there and even start some initial projects this year. So that's what I'd say generally on some of the new regions. I wouldn't -- I'd be remised if I didn't talk about also our existing customers that given how we execute with them and assuming we continue to execute well, we are in discussions with some of the same customers we've announced on follow-on projects because of how we're performing. Obviously we need to keep up the good performance from an execution perspective. Follow-on good performance will mean that we're going to be perceived well for new deals. We're really excited about that. An example is with Jupiter, we announced a first project, actually 2 projects with them. They're the largest in ERCOT, but we announced 2 projects, one in California, one in Texas. But in addition, we had announced with them a sourcing collaboration around 2.4 gigawatt hours of batteries for them together. And those are customers. And Jupiter, as you know, was acquired by BlackRock's infrastructure group back in Q4. And so obviously no shortage of capital there. But you can assume that our existing customers where we're going to execute well, there are follow-on discussions ongoing with those same customers that will represent a strength and upside for us.Brian H. DobsonWe'll take your next question from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.Brian K. LeeIn the interest of time, maybe just one question from my end. Can you guys give us a sense of the margin differential between EVx and EVS? And are you currently profitable on EVS? Or if not, what's sort of the path forward to become profitable on selling EVS.Robert Allen PiconiOkay. We don't sell EVS, so let me just clarify some things. The Energy Vault Solution is actually a group, it's not a product itself, so. But just to be clear, I think what you're asking is, are there any things not profitable across between -- or anything not profitable specifically. I think when you say EVS, I think you're referring to some of the battery deployments where they've been leading with software. So to be clear, everything we're doing is profitable on a unit economic basis. Otherwise, there would be no way for us to talk about 10% to 50% gross margins. So there's not one project we've done or taken with a negative gross margin. And for us to forecast here with the visibility we have now of 10% to 15% and given our nature of being conservative relative to as we were looking at our 2023 forecast, we're from a profitability perspective, we have unit economics across the board. We're going to have a range of that percentage gross margin pending on things like, for example, are we taking batteries through our balance sheet at a, like a mid-single digit or not. If we're not, we're absolutely in the mid- to high teens, relative to just our own straight solutions, and that's today. And if we're on looking at EVx, for example, and solutions on where we're going to be deploying that project as well on the initial deployment, so before we get to volumes or any optimization. As an example, we're testing a lot of a lot of new cost reduction on the system in China in EVx that all the future systems will benefit from. That range of 10% to 15%, I think, is a good range, Brian, for you to use relative to your modeling. And then the last thing I'd share is it's really the use case that's the driver. So let me give you the example of PG&amp;E where they -- it was an RFP for this multiday and they were thinking they were only going to have natural gas as an option. We've proactively given, we actually have expertise in hydrogen, both liquid and gas and or gas because of some engineering folks that we've hired in the team. So we proposed an architecture that integrated lithium-ion and green hydrogen. You can assume that because we were unique in being able to do that, obviously, that's going to be something that we don't take lightly relative to our pricing expectations and therefore the margins. And obviously it's a public utility. So that means that we have to provide a certain level of value to the utility if they -- is what they budgeted to deliver that. So those solutions where we're uniquely bringing hybrid solutions to the table as we did there, those are things that are going to be a good part of our profit stream as well. Is that helpful?OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'd now like to turn the call back over to Robert Piconi for closing remarks. Over to you, sir.Robert Allen PiconiOkay. Look, thanks everyone who joined the call today, and we'll look forward to further updates going forward. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.]"

In fact, during 2022, PG&amp;E received nearly 23,000 reports from customers who were targeted by scammers impersonating the company, and customers lost approximately $946,000 in fraudulent payments. Unfortunately, this number is likely just the tip of the iceberg for overall scam attempts, as many go unreported. The number of reports is continuing at a high level thus far in 2023, as PG&amp;E received 4,800 reports of attempted scams in January alone, with customers paying scammers over $126,000 during the month.""If you ever receive a call threatening disconnection if you do not make immediate payment, hang up and either call PG&amp;E to confirm your account details or log onto your account on PGE.com. Remember, PG&amp;E will never ask for you for your financial information over the phone or via email, nor will we request payment via pre-paid debit cards or other payment services like Zelle,"" said Matt Foley, lead customer scam investigator for PG&amp;E.Scammers are opportunistic and look for times when customers may be distracted or stressed, as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, scammers have increased calls, texts, emails, and in-person tactics and are constantly contacting utility customers asking for immediate payment to avoid service disconnection. As a reminder, PG&amp;E will never send a single notification to a customer within one hour of a service interruption, and we will never ask customers to make payments with a pre-paid debit card, gift card, any form of cryptocurrency, or third-party digital payment mobile applications.Story continuesScammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams.Signs of a potential scamThreat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively demand immediate payment for an alleged past due bill.Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to purchase a prepaid card then call them back supposedly to make a bill payment.Request for prepaid card: When the customer calls back, the caller asks the customer for the prepaid card's number, which grants the scammer instant access to the card's funds.Refund or rebate offers: Scammers may say that your utility company overbilled you and owes you a refund, or that you are entitled to a rebate.How customers can protect themselvesCustomers should never purchase a prepaid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&amp;E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person.If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill.Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts.Scammers Impersonating Trusted Phone Numbers: Scammers are now able to create authentic-looking 800 numbers which appear on your phone display. The numbers don't lead back to PG&amp;E if called back, however, so if you have doubts, hang up and call PG&amp;E at 1-833-500-SCAM. If customers ever feel that they are in physical danger, they should call 911.Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with one of these scammers, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission's website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information.For more information about scams, visit pge.com/scams or consumer.ftc.org.

135,32698cb0-965e-3af9-bec6-6ca35078eed7,MSI,2023-03-09,There's A Lot To Like About Motorola Solutions' (NYSE:MSI) Upcoming US$0.88 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-motorola-solutions-nyse-102229750.html,1678357349,STORY,['MSI'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Motorola Solutions investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.88 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.52 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Motorola Solutions has a trailing yield of 1.3% on the current stock price of $267.59. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Motorola Solutions has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Motorola Solutions's payout ratio is modest, at just 40% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 34% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Motorola Solutions's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 29% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Motorola Solutions has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Motorola Solutions worth buying for its dividend? We love that Motorola Solutions is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Motorola Solutions looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Motorola Solutions for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Motorola Solutions you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

136,3afbaec6-4884-3865-9978-2c5b7b346647,MSI,2023-03-09,Ericsson (ERIC) to Pay $206M Fine for Corruption Violations,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ericsson-eric-pay-206m-fine-151503098.html,1678202103,STORY,"['ERIC-B.ST', 'IDCC', 'MSI', 'JNPR', 'ERIC']","[Ericsson ERIC has brokered a truce with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DoJ”) over alleged charges of bribery and falsifying records in countries from China to Kuwait by agreeing to pay a fine of $206 million. In addition, the company has agreed to plead guilty to U.S. foreign corruption violations.The U.S. DoJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) conducted separate investigations against Ericsson, with the former pursuing criminal charges and the latter civil charges related to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The charges, pertaining to a period spanning 2000-2016, relate to offering bribes, falsifying books and records through sophisticated schemes and failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls to safeguard the ethical business policies of the company.The recent fine pertains to the charges that Ericsson has failed to “truthfully disclose"" all information and evidence in the Djibouti and China cases and in other potential bribery or accounting violations.This follows a separate news a few days earlier that revealed that Ericsson has decided to trim its global workforce by about 8% to reduce costs. The company intends to lay off about 8,500 employees to reduce operating costs by 9 billion Swedish kronor ($857 million) by the end of this year.It appears that the company is burdened with problems as it expects a substantially lower market share in China. It had warned that Sweden’s decision to exclude Chinese vendors from Swedish 5G networks might adversely impact its business in the East Asian country. The company is witnessing a sales decline in China in the Networks and Digital Services segments.Ericsson expects some impact on sales from disturbances in the supply chain as well. It expects a negative impact from IPR renewals and investments to strengthen its business in the long term. Ericsson’s business is also likely to be hurt by the political and economic uncertainties in its operating countries.Other notable players in the industry include Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR, InterDigital, Inc. IDCC and Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI.Juniper has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 7% and delivered an earnings surprise of 1.6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. The company is leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center. Juniper is set to capitalize on the increasing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence.InterDigital is focused on pursuing agreements with unlicensed customers in the handset and consumer electronics markets. The company aims to become a leading designer and developer of technology solutions and innovation for the mobile industry, IoT and allied technology areas by leveraging its research and development capabilities, technological know-how and rich industry experience. At the same time, InterDigital intends to enhance its licensing revenue base by adding licensees and expanding into adjacent technology areas that align with its intellectual property position.As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market. The communications equipment maker intends to boost its position in the public safety domain by entering into strategic alliances with other players in the ecosystem. Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. The buyout of 911 Datamaster, Inc. is likely to reinforce its position as a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday withdrew a $54 million contract with Walgreens after the pharmacy giant indicated it would not sell an abortion pill by mail in some conservative-led states.Newsom on Wednesday ordered state officials to not renew a contract with Walgreens to purchase specialty pharmacy prescription drugs for California's prison health care system, including antiviral and antifungal drugs and medication used for congestive heart failure. Walgreens has gotten about $54 million from the contract, which expires April 30.Newsom's office said the state will buy the drugs somewhere else.“California will not stand by as corporations cave to extremists and cut off critical access to reproductive care and freedom,” Newsom said in a news release. “California is on track to be the fourth largest economy in the world and we will leverage our market power to defend the right to choose.”Walgreens representative Fraser Engerman said the company was “deeply disappointed by the decision by the state of California not to renew our longstanding contract due to false and misleading information.""“Walgreens is facing the same circumstances as all retail pharmacies, and no other pharmacies have said that they would approach this situation differently, so it's unclear where this contract would not be moved,” Engerman said. “Our position has always been that, once we are certified by the FDA, Walgreens plans to dispense Mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so, including the state of California.”Mifepristone is a pill that when combined with another pill will end a pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the pill in 2000 for use in up to the 10th week of pregnancy. Today, more than half of all abortions in the U.S. are done by pills, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.After the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned the federal right to an abortion, more than a dozen states have restricted the use of abortion pills. But those restrictions are being challenged in court.Story continuesAttorneys general in 20 states, mostly with Republican governors, have warned Walgreens and CVS they could face legal consequences if they sell abortion pills in their states. Last week, Walgreens confirmed it sent a response to each attorney general saying it would not dispense the drug in their states.Newsom responded to that news on Monday, posting in a message on Twitter that California won't be doing business with Walgreens “or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women's lives at risk.”“We're done,” Newsom said.Losing the California contract will have a small impact on Walgreens' revenues, as the company reported $132.7 billion in sales for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31.But for Newsom, the move is more about solidifying California's role as a leader in what he has called “reproductive freedom.”Newsom has vowed to make California a sanctuary for people in other states where abortion is illegal or severely restricted. Last year, Newsom signed more than a dozen new laws aiming to protect abortion rights, including signing off on $20 million in new spending to help pay for the travel and lodging expenses for people to come to California from other states to get an abortion.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -7.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which Walgreens falls in, has lost 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share, indicating a change of -30.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.83 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walgreens.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $134.51 billion and $139.9 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $33.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

148,b4f89a47-b686-3eec-adb7-410b6118cdee,WBA,2023-03-09,Editorial: Walgreens is despicable for bowing to pressure not to sell abortion pills in some states,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/editorial-walgreens-despicable-bowing-pressure-110047902.html,1678273247.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens announced it won't sell abortion medication in 20 states, only half of which have full bans on abortion. (Associated Press)When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced earlier this year that it would allow drugstore chains to sell mifepristone, the highly regulated first drug taken in a two-drug regimen for medication abortion, Walgreens and other pharmacy chains eagerly stepped up and said they would go through the required certification process.But after attorneys general in 20 Republican-led states wrote an ominous letter to Walgreens' executive vice president reminding her of abortion laws and warning — questionably — that it was illegal to mail abortion pills in the U.S., the company told several news outlets that it would not sell in those states. The company received a similar letter from Kansas Atty. Gen. Kris Kobach — and wrote back saying it wouldn’t sell the drug in Kansas.Walgreens insisted in statements in recent days that once it was certified, it would sell the abortion pills in states where it was legal. But the retailer's statements to the general public conflict with what it has told those conservative states. Abortion — including medication abortion — is legal in half of the 21 states that wrote to Walgreens and later received assurances the retailer would not sell in those states. And most of those states where it’s legal allow people to take abortion medication outside of a provider’s office — which means Walgreens can sell in those states. In the rest of those states abortion is banned with limited exceptions or, in one case, unavailable because there is no abortion clinic.The one thing that all the 21 states have in common are elected officials hostile to abortion rights.It would be understandable if Walgreens officials put out a statement saying their hands were tied in the 10 states where abortion is banned. But instead the pharmacy chain caved to political pressure, and that is despicable.No wonder California Gov. Gavin Newsom exploded on Twitter on Monday, declaring, “California won’t be doing business with Walgreens — or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk. We’re done.” It's still not clear whether the state of California can be “done” with Walgreens, and what it might mean for government-subsidized prescriptions. The relationship is more complicated than Newsom's statement suggests, but we certainly understand his frustration.Story continuesIn a post-Roe era when states are trying to restrict abortion, including medication abortion, which is more easily available than a surgical abortion, it’s outrageous for a drugstore chain to be in any way connected to thwarting access. Abortion care is healthcare, and that should be Walgreens’ primary concern.It also sets a dangerous example that could induce more people to try to bully businesses into taking away people’s right to healthcare. In states where abortion is precariously available and constantly under attack, chains like Walgreens are lifelines for pregnant people with limited resources to travel to a clinic.When Walgreens capitulated to Kobach's letter warning the company not to send mail-order mifepristone into Kansas — where access to medication abortion is under attack — and assured him that it would not sell the drug at all in the state, the attorney general chortled in a news release that Walgreens’ decision was “a significant victory for the pro-life cause and for women’s health.” Medication abortion is extremely safe. This was nothing more than a political scare tactic — and the fact that Walgreens fell for it is deeply disturbing.Shame on Walgreens executives who have rewarded years of support from customers with a cold shoulder just when they need help most. This spineless betrayal has already caused the company's stock to dip amid understandable calls for boycotts. Walgreens should reverse course, take back promises made to antiabortion politicians and loudly affirm that the chain will indeed sell mifepristone in every state where abortion is legal.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Meanwhile, in a memo to employees obtained by Yahoo Finance, CEO Roz Brewer tried to assure them that the company would, as it has done all along, consider selling mifepristone in states where it is legal.In a separate, but similar, controversial letter to Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, Walgreens said it ""does not intend to dispense mifepristone within your state and does not intend to ship Mifepristone into your state from any of our pharmacies. If this approach changes, we will be sure to notify you.""But the response, similarly sent to the 20 other AGs in Republican-lead states, according to a report by Politico, has spurred criticism ranging from calls to withdraw its decision from U.S. lawmakers and an all out boycott of the drug chain giant on social media.Various reports have erroneously said that Walgreens will stop dispensing the drug. In reality, it has not begun that process. Furthermore, it would not be legally allowed to sell the drug in states with abortion bans in place.""What we're talking about hasn't even happened. This is more about how will this affect access in the future,"" said Alina Salganicoff, a senior vice president and the director of Women's Health Policy at Kaiser Family Foundation.The FDA decision in January to allow retail pharmacies to apply for approval to dispense the pill, known generically as mifepristone — a process which could take several months— is the reason behind the backlash. During the pandemic, the Biden administration temporarily waived restrictions on mail order for the pill, and in January made the change permanent.In the internal memo, Brewer expressed an understanding of the sensitive issue.""I understand that our team members, patients and customers have deeply-held beliefs on this issue, and we must be very respectful of those beliefs,"" Brewer said, adding that other retailers like CVS (CVS) and Rite Aid (RAD) are also applying to distribute the pill.Story continues""I want to be very clear about what our position has been all along: Walgreens plans to dispense mifepristone where it is legal, and not to dispense mifepristone where it is illegal,"" Brewer, a former executive of Walmart and Starbucks, said.The FDA decision follows the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Mifepristone is one of two pills used for early-stage abortion, up to 10 weeks, which blocks a hormone that would allow the pregnancy to continue. It is considered an oral contraceptive but has been highly regulated by the FDA, requiring a doctor's consultation to use. The second pill is misoprostol, which is commonly used to prevent stomach ulcers, but also helps relax the uterus, and is already available at any pharmacy.Legal issues aheadThe exchange with Kansas is a preview of what other pharmacies are set to contend with as a slew of court cases and legislation could impact their potential market share — and whether or not they end up dispensing it all.This includes a case in Texas that threatens the use of mifepristone. The lawsuit alleges the FDA did not conduct proper testing of its use, and is one KFF and clinics like Planned Parenthood are monitoring closely.While Kansas does allow the use of mifepristone for abortions, it has strict access rules. The state is currently in the process of banning tele-health abortion visits — which would take mail order off the table.""At this time, we are working through the certification process, which includes the evaluation of our pharmacy network to determine where we will dispense Mifepristone and training protocols and updates for our pharmacists,"" the company said in its response to Kansas.""Walgreens has not made any representations about using our mail order pharmacy business to dispense this drug,"" it added.A hasty decision on mifepristone? A Walgreens store in Chicago. REUTERS/Eileen T. MeslarOf the 20 states which signed on the separate letter, abortion is still legal in a few — but some of those could face legal challenges or are at various stages of restricting access to abortion.The 20 include Missouri, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.Florida, where abortion is legal, just introduced legislation Tuesday that would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. This legislation mimics Texas's prior law, which was the strictest in the country short of a full ban, because it left women with an unreasonably tight window to find out they are pregnant and schedule the abortion. One study, for example, showed at least 33% of women find out they are pregnant after six weeks.All told the situation remains dynamic, and any pharmacy, whether retail or online, is contending with the same uncertainty.DiRx, an online pharmacy dealing in generics that is licensed in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., is doing the same thing Walgreens intends to do.""This came up even earlier when the Roe v. Wade overturning was happening. We do ship oral contraceptives to states where it is legally OK to do so, without getting into the politics of it. Wherever there are question marks, we always make sure we check on the compliance aspects,"" said DiRx CEO Satish Srinivasan.Walgreens is doing no different.""Once we are certified by the FDA, we will dispense this medication consistent with federal and state laws. Providing legally approved medications to patients is what pharmacies do, and is rooted in our commitment to the communities in which we operate,"" the company said Monday.BacklashDespite the nuance involved, the response from Walgreens to the Attorneys General has caused significant backlash, with top U.S. lawmakers calling for a reversal of the decision as well as a boycott of the pharmacy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is threatening to not do business with Walgreens.California won't be doing business with @walgreens -- or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women's lives at risk.We're done.https://t.co/OB10cYfm8H— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) March 6, 2023California has been working on creating a generic drug manufacturing strategy for its residents, and the clash with Walgreens means it could be cut out of the distribution process if Newsom holds to the threat.In addition, Walgreens is currently doing business with the state through its Medicaid and other government-run health services. It is not clear if Newsom's threat extends to the Medicaid program.But the situation has still caught the attention of U.S. lawmakers and advocacy groups alike.“This is the exact result anti-abortion actors want from their intimidation tactics. When politicians have the ability to interfere in the patient-provider relationship — in defiance of well-established science and medical evidence — people seeking access to timely, essential health care suffer,"" said Danika Wynn, vice president of abortion access at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement.U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), meanwhile, expressed similar outrage on social media.""It’s outrageous for MAGA extremists to intimidate pharmacies into refusing to dispense a medication that FDA deemed safe &amp; effective over two decades ago,"" she said in a tweet, adding that all pharmacies should not be intimidated, including Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Now, the pharmacy giant says it will provide those medications in jurisdictions where it's permissible. But it seems the damage has already been done. There's a lot to unpack here.Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani has the latest for us here. You know what? Rather than start with California, I'm gonna start with Walgreens.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: OK.JULIE HYMAN: I'm gonna flip it on its head here.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Fine.JULIE HYMAN: Because what is Walgreens doing?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: OK. So here's where the story kind of got mixed. Last week, we got a report from the Kansas attorney general who released a statement saying that Walgreens has agreed not to sell the abortion pill, one of the two abortion pills that are used, mifepristone, in Kansas. That is important because that is just Walgreens response saying, we acknowledge your state law and that we're not going to then sell in your state because it is illegal and there was threats of lawsuits.So what Walgreens is saying is, we are not selling in states where it is already illegal and where there are abortion bans. However, we are going to be applying to dispense in states where it is legal. And that includes not using mail order for those states where it is illegal. That's what Walgreens has said.And you can see it clearly. We obtained an internal memo that CEO Roz Brewer sent to employees. And it does say very clearly, ""We want to be clear about what our position has always been. Walgreens plans to dispense in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible.""And then saying that once they're certified by the FDA, which could take several months, by the way, they do intend to then be in those states where, again, where it's legal, but also saying that they, quote, ""Do not dispense where it is illegal."" So they're being very clear that they're just trying to follow state law.Story continuesNow, here's where the issue kind of splits. Some are wondering whether or not, because the mail is under the federal jurisdiction, they could, in fact, go around that. That's not clear. And that's part of where some of these lawsuits come in that have been going on. And so that's the question that is still really on the table is, what can be done? What options do Walgreens and CVS have when it comes to states where the abortion bans are in place and potentially going to be in place?JARED BLIKRE: So it sounds like they're not trying to take a political stance. But nevertheless, that is the interpretation because we're all human here. And how does this fit into what California is doing?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So that's where California comes in. That's where Governor Newsom read the headlines, which said that Walgreens was stopping dispensing, which they already are not. So that's the first problem. But he did say, quote, ""That he will not do business with Walgreens or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women lives at risk.""Now, Walgreens is-- like we just mentioned, not, not doing something. It's just, you know, trying to follow state laws. Now, what Governor Newsom is saying is that because of that stance, because the headlines are reading that Walgreens is stopping and responded to their attorney generals in the affirmative, sounding like they were acquiescing to the threats, that the Governor is now going to look at all the business that does.That includes through Medi-Cal, the local-- the Medicaid insurance. As well as potentially, this could affect in the long run if this does stay in place, if he makes good on the threat, the drug manufacturing business that they're trying to stand up, which is that generic drug production that California has been looking at for the past year or so. And so once that builds up, obviously, they will look at the Walgreens and the CVSes of the role to be part of that distribution process, and this could affect that in the future.Now, that's where sort of the long term view is. Now, Walgreens is not the only player in this. Obviously, we know CVS, Rite Aid, Target, Walmart, and the like, potentially even other mail order services, like we know Hims &amp; Hers. And we haven't heard from any of these.So the question is, where do they all fit into this? How many other online pharmacies are going to be able to bypass some of these state laws if they are able to and what the process will be there? So it's really, like we said yesterday, developing story. Still a lot of time-- [CLEARS THROAT] sorry, on the table-- because of the FDA certification.JULIE HYMAN: All right, well, we'll be checking back in with you then, Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: See you tomorrow.[LAUGHTER]JULIE HYMAN: Anjalee Khemlani, appreciate it.]"

For more companies, head on over to 10 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World. The software as a service (SaaS) industry is one of the hottest sectors in the technology sector right now. The growth of the Internet and connectivity in general has created new business models and allowed existing businesses to transform their operations and take advantage of external products and processes without having to deal with large capital investment for their own systems. This allows firms to streamline their daily processes such as human resources and payroll and take advantage of specialized services. At the same time, it generates new business models where entire businesses are set up to facilitate other businesses or professionals at carrying out their operations.These diverse use cases and the fact that the industry itself still hasn't fully matured lead to some optimistic valuations and growth estimates for the SaaS sector. One such estimate comes from Market Research Future, with the firm estimating that the SaaS industry is estimated to grow to $381 billion by the end of this decade from the start and through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3%. This growth and the strong valuation for a software subscription platform that does not have the luxury of high product prices like the hardware industry does is still unsurprising given that some of the biggest technology companies in the world such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) have dedicated cloud computing divisions. This growth is also fueled by the relatively easier adaptability of the SaaS platforms, as Market Research Future points out that firms find it easier to access complex software products via the cloud instead of spending heavily to develop such capabilities in house.Another more optimistic estimate for the SaaS industry comes from FinancialNewsMedia. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $121 billion in 2020 and from then until it will grow at a stronger CAGR of 18.8% to be worth $702 billion by the end of 2023.Story continuesHowever, despite these rosy estimates, the SaaS sector is still a technology industry and as such is subject to macroeconomic pitfalls. These days inflation and high interest rates are restricting corporate budgets and cloud computing spending is also dropping as a result. Yet, SaaS companies are adamant that their business is growing, with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s chief executive officer Mr. William McDermott highlighting during a recent earnings call that:C-level buyers don’t want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, “We can’t afford 1,000 points of We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.” So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow. This begins with our business model. ServiceNow with born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world.Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation. . . . .Right now, many technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest SaaS companies in the world, out of which the top picks are Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).30 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World in 2023Our Methodology We started to compile our list by searching for the largest SaaS companies that operate in North America, Australia, China, and Europe after which they were ranked through their market capitalization or estimated valuation. All of these companies generate the bulk of their revenue from providing software platforms, but in rare cases, companies for which SaaS is integral to their business model and their scope is too big to exclude are also included.30 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World in 202330.

Interim Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will testify at a Senate hearing on Mar. 29 about the company’s apparent union-busting tactics after being subpoenaed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.Schultz initially declined an invitation to appear in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Thursday (March 9), prompting Sanders to compel his attendance. Sanders, the chair of the committee, said Starbucks defied a number of other congressional oversight inquiries, including additional meetings and requested documents.Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?Starbucks has been accused of violating federal labor law on a number of different fronts.The general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed over 500 unfair labor practice charges against the company, according to a spokesperson for the board. And, just last week, a judge ruled that Starbucks violated federal labor laws in union negotiations with workers. Specifically, the rulings found that the company had engaged in “egregious and widespread misconduct” in its response to the labor campaign.After Sanders first notified Starbucks of his intention to subpoena Schultz, Zabrina Jenkins, the company’s general counsel, said she was “shocked and deeply concerned” at the request, adding that Schultz had not been involved in labor negotiations and was due to step down in the coming months.Sanders responded the same day: “Schultz is the founder of Starbucks, he is the CEO of Starbucks, he is the spokesperson for Starbucks, and he will continue to be on the board of directors at Starbucks well into the future… Mr. Schultz has made it clear that he is the driving force of labor policy at Starbucks.”Schultz is set to resign from his position as CEO for the third time on April 1, with former Pepsi chief commercial officer Laxman Narasimhan due to succeed him.

After 30 years in Congress, as well as two presidential bids, Sanders may have the most powerful position of his career as chairman of the senate labor committee, and he knows it.Sanders has been aggressive right out of the gate, saying some corporations “should be nervous,” and vowing to take on pharmaceutical companies and the country’s “dysfunctional” healthcare system. While it is unclear how much actual legislation he will get passed with a Republican-led House, (or, for that matter, a Democratic-controlled Senate), Sanders understands his new position gives him a highly-visible role in Washington.“I am chairman of the committee and I want to accomplish as much as I can,” Sanders said. “On the other hand, there are issues out there that I do not expect will be passed in this Congress, but are very important and they have to be talked about.”For instance, last month Sanders hosted a press conference alongside railroad unions to demand a minimum of seven guaranteed paid sick days for rail workers. A week later he invited public school employees and representatives from teacher’s unions to the capitol for a town hall on teacher pay.Fellow committee member Mitt Romney, a Republican senator from Utah, has criticized Sanders’ approach to the chairmanship, dismissing it as “a lot of storm and fury” while predicting that “very little [legislation] will reach the floor.”Related stories🗺️Find the closest unionized Starbucks to you with this map☕Starbucks’ union-busting tactics are facing the heat📈 The growing US labor movement in 3 chartsMore from QuartzWhat higher H-1B fees will mean for Indians hoping to work in the USMore than half of US nursing homes are unprofitable—and it's about to get a lot worseSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

(Associated Press)Few American companies strive to project as warm and welcoming an image as Starbucks, in its treatment of customers and workers alike.That may have ended with a ruling last week by a National Labor Relations Board judge, who cited the coffeehouse chain for ""hundreds of unfair labor practices"" amounting to ""egregious and widespread misconduct demonstrating a general disregard for the employees' fundamental rights.""Administrative Law Judge Michael Rosas' ruling related to the company's response to an organizing drive by Starbucks Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, in Buffalo, N.Y.Starbucks is the poster child of union-busting in the United States.Starbucks Union official Gary Bonadonna Jr.That region became the epicenter of a movement that has now held successful union votes at 289 of the company's roughly 9,000 locations.One would have to look far and wide for as uncompromising a condemnation of union-busting as the 218-page ruling issued March 1 by Rosas, or the extraordinary remedies he ordered from the company.These include mandates that Starbucks rehire scores of Buffalo-area workers Rosas found to have been fired for union activities, restoring back pay to many more whose hours were cut, allegedly for participation in or support of the unionization drive, and the reopening of at least one location allegedly shuttered to hobble unionization.Most remarkably, Rosas ordered Chief Executive Howard Schultz and Denise Nelson, the company's senior vice president for U.S. operations, to read out (or have it read out in their presence) a 13-page statement detailing workers' unionization rights, all the ways they were violated and all the remedies he specified.The notice must also be posted in every Starbucks store where it can be seen by employees, whom the company invariably describes as ""partners.""This is strong medicine for Schultz, who is in his third stint as CEO. (He's stepping down from that role this month but will remain on the board.) After resisting an invitation to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Schultz agreed to appear when committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) threatened to seek a subpoena. Schultz's testimony is scheduled for March 29.Story continuesThe company has maintained that Schultz hasn't been involved in union issues at Starbucks, but that's nonsense. The anti-union stance at Starbucks must be laid at his door. As we reported in April, after becoming ""interim CEO"" in March 2022 he made himself the face and voice of the company's ferocious counterattack on the unionization drive.Schultz appeared in videotaped town hall presentations and put his name to written communications to workers and managers. There and in group meetings with workers around the country, he repeatedly characterized unions as a menace to the company’s economics and culture.“Outside labor unions are attempting to sell a very different view of what Starbucks should be,” he wrote in an open letter posted on the company’s website April 10. Employees “supporting unionization are colluding with outside union forces. ... I do not believe conflict, division and dissension — which has been a focus of union organizing — benefits Starbucks or our partners.”Starbucks has also hired Littler Mendelson, a law firm that boasts of guiding companies “in developing and initiating strategies that lawfully avoid unions.”These include advising management on “precise and compliant messaging to employees ... that may include informational signs and posters, home letters, meeting materials, testimonial videos, social media postings, handouts and campaign websites.”Rosas' ruling is subject to review by the National Labor Relations Board, which has a Biden-appointed Democratic majority and a Biden-appointed general counsel, a powerful administrative post, after years in which it was under the sway of a worker-hostile Trump majority and general counsel.The order can be appealed by Starbucks, which has said it will seek to ""obtain further legal review."" Rosas' ruling applies to 20 Buffalo-area locations and one in Rochester, N.Y.What's fascinating about the ruling is how the judge laid out the road map of methods, from subtle to naked, followed by employers determined to bust unions in the modern age. Many of these are disguised as agreeable efforts to foster cooperation and collaboration between management and employees, but they're illegal nonetheless.The company told me by email, “We believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter and are considering all options to obtain further legal review.”Judging from Rosas' descriptions, Starbucks followed the union-busting playbook to the letter. Union-busters advise managements to paint the unions as “outsiders,"" say that they’ll disrupt the smooth working of the company or even drive it out of business, and that unions will make it impossible for workers to deal directly with management.The company ""blitzed the Buffalo market with an extraordinary number of corporate officials, managers and others"" who staged ""listening sessions"" with groups of local employees to solicit their views about adverse working conditions and pledging, sometimes only implicitly, to rectify them, Rosas observed. Schultz personally participated in some of these meetings.Superficially, these appeared to be responsible queries by management. But none of them had occurred before Buffalo workers announced the first unionization drive with a tweet and open letter Aug. 23, 2021, addressed to then-CEO Kevin Johnson.The letter shifted the ground beneath management's feet, for NLRB standards hold that soliciting grievances or promising benefits during a union campaign is illegal because that ""improperly influences employees' choices"" and can be ""timed to discourage union support,"" Rosas wrote.Starbucks also announced a company-wide pay increase; because that came after the open letter, Rosas judged it ""coercive,"" especially because employees at the listening sessions had complained about pay.The company took less covert steps to quash union activity. Some union advocates were fired or had their hours cut. Some stores where employees demonstrated clear union sympathies were closed, temporarily or permanently.Supervisors worked inside the stores to an unprecedented extent, leading workers to believe they were under surveillance for union activities.Some of the company's actions seemed to be wholly cynical. After workers at one store complained of its being chronically understaffed, management inundated the location with new and transferred workers. That created overcrowding behind the counter and operational chaos, while reducing the incumbent workers' share of tips and reducing the percentage of the store's pro-union vote.The company's efforts ""had their intended effect,"" Rosas noted, pointing to the sharp decline of union support at one store where 16 employees had signed union authorization cards in the first week of the organizing campaign, but only eight were still supporting the union by the time votes were counted.After successful union votes at several stores, Starbucks slow-walked contract negotiations. Accordingly, Rosas ordered the company to start contract bargaining at three stores, including the one where he found that the anti-union campaign had undermined union support.Rosas' ruling underscores the difficulty of union organizing. Corporate managements have a multitude of ways to discourage unionization, not always through threats.Timely wage increases, for example, can be terrifically effective at diluting unions' appeal because they can be made to look like expressions of pure corporate benevolence, when they're really stratagems aimed at depriving employees the long-term voice on workplace conditions that they can seldom achieve except through collective bargaining.It's tempting to see the organizing success of Starbucks Workers United as a herald of worker power and the NLRB ruling as a sign that the regulatory tide has finally turned in labor's favor.But that would be a mistake. Management still holds most of the cards, abetted by anti-union federal laws such as the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.Although union membership increased last year by 273,000 to 14.3 million, the union membership rate fell to 10.1% from 10.3% in 2021.And it would only take a turn of the presidential electoral wheel in 2024 to convert the National Labor Relations Board from a protector of collective bargaining rights back into a sedulous guardian of management prerogatives.It may be true, for the moment, that ""Starbucks is the poster child of union-busting in the United States,"" in the words of Starbucks Workers United official Gary Bonadonna Jr. But the fight is not nearly over.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Founder and CEO Howard Schultz is no longer refusing to testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee over the company's labor practices. Now, Committee Chair Senator Bernie Sanders announcing earlier today that he's, quote, ""happy that Schultz finally agreed,"" in his words, to appear. Senator Sanders is investigating a number of complaints that Starbucks violated federal labor laws under Schultz's leadership. Now, on Twitter earlier today, Senator Sanders wrote, quote, ""I look forward to hearing from him as to when he intends to end his illegal anti-union activities and begin signing fair first contracts with the unions.""Now, Starbucks employees have been voting to unionize at very quick speeds here. Just the past two years, employees at more than 280 locations have done just that, with calls for better pay and benefits, and also improved safety conditions. Now, even though they have voted to unionize, those unions have yet to reach an agreement with Starbucks. So Schultz under fire there from many of these employees that have voted to unionize. Getting some pressure also from certain members of Congress. We'll see what he has to say later on this month.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I'm curious how he's going to come across because this is a very sensitive subject right now and something that we're seeing throughout corporate America. Amazon pushing for unions. Disney pushing for a unions. Starbucks is not alone in this. Apparently, Starbucks' general counsel wrote to the committee that another executive should testify and not Schultz, since he'll be stepping down as interim CEO this month.But Sanders very adamant that he wanted to be-- that he wanted it to be Schultz, considering his policies have been the one that's really been criticized. And if you take a look back since Schultz took over last April, there has been this big non-union push with raising wages and benefits for non-union members. So again, we'll have to see how he comes across.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Two big questions as he's out the door, to your point. One is related to unions. The other one is related to olive oil. And that's the real question I have.SEANA SMITH: That's what everyone wants--DAVE BRIGGS: Look, the unions will hash this out. I'm not sure where that eventually goes. But this Oleato line of olive oil-infused drinks from--ALEXANDRA CANAL: We've got to try it.DAVE BRIGGS: --Howard Schultz and Starbucks-- well, we don't have access to them yet.SEANA SMITH: But when we do.DAVE BRIGGS: That just sounds like an odd pairing that I can't quite swallow. But we are going to try to make it here. What's your vote? I mean, yay or nay?SEANA SMITH: [STAMMERS]DAVE BRIGGS: It sounds like a nay.SEANA SMITH: Nay, yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: Allie?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I feel like I get--SEANA SMITH: I want to like it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --my olive oil in other places, like my salads.

Schultz, who is stepping down from his post this month, had earlier declined an invitation from 11 senators to testify before the panel on March 9.Committee Democrats had scheduled a vote for Wednesday - canceled after Schultz agreed to testify - on issuing a subpoena to compel Schultz's appearance. The company previously offered other executives to speak instead.Over the years, Schultz helped Starbucks build a reputation as a progressive employer, offering higher salaries and more benefits - including company stock and health insurance - than other restaurant chains.But the company's response to a growing union campaign, as well some of Schultz's public comments, have been described by some critics, including some shareholders, as overly aggressive.Democratic lawmakers have accused Starbucks of illegally firing pro-union employees and shuttering freshly unionized stores, which the company denies.""Despite the fact that over 280 Starbucks coffee shops have successfully voted to form a union over the past year, Starbucks has refused to negotiate in good faith to sign a single first contract with their employees,"" Sanders said in a statement.At its March 23 annual shareholder meeting, Starbucks investors will vote on a proposal for an external audit of the chain's labor policies. Two top proxy advisers have recommended 'yes' votes on the proposal, and Starbucks has since said it is conducting its own review.Story continuesUNION POLICIESAs head of the company, Schultz was not involved in making decisions about labor law, instead delegating them to other executives, Starbucks' Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer AJ Jones II said in an interview.The company had made 17 requests in the past to meet with Sanders' staff to discuss unions, before finally being granted a meeting on Feb. 17, he said.Jones said he and other Starbucks representatives met again with Sanders' staff on Monday.Schultz plans to testify about how Starbucks has led the industry in offering higher wages and better benefits, and will discuss ""who we are as a company... and what we stand for,"" he said.In a statement, Starbucks Workers United, the Service Employees International Affiliate organizing most of the newly unionized Starbucks cafes, said it looked forward to hearing from Schultz.""As the architect of Starbucks' unprecedented anti-union campaign, it is high time for him to be held accountable for his actions,"" the union said.Employees at more than 280 of Starbucks' roughly 9,000 company-operated U.S. locations have voted to join a labor union since 2021. The union is seeking better pay and benefits, improved health and safety conditions and protections against unfair dismissal and discipline.Sanders said that the U.S. National Labor Relations Board has issued more than 80 complaints against Starbucks for violating federal labor law. Sanders also noted that an administrative law judge in New York has ruled that the company engaged in ""egregious and widespread misconduct"" in the union organizing campaign.(Reporting by Kanishka Singh and David Shepardson in Washington and Hilary Russ in New York; Editing by Will Dunham, Tim Ahmann and Rosalba O'Brien)]"

Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Tuesday that Schultz has agreed to testify before the committee on March 29.Sanders had been asking Schultz to testify for several weeks, but Schultz had previously refused, saying the company's chief public affairs officer would be better equipped to discuss the company's labor record. But the committee disagreed and had scheduled a Wednesday vote to subpoena Schultz in an effort to force him to testify.“I look forward to hearing from Mr. Schultz as to when he intends to end his illegal anti-union activities and begin signing fair first contracts with the unions,” Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.In a letter to the committee, Starbucks said it looks forward to “productive dialogue” with the committee.“We will endeavor to provide a deeper understanding of our culture and priorities, including our industry leading benefits offerings and our long-standing commitment to support the shared success of our more than 450,000 global partners,” Starbucks’ Chief Counsel Zabrina Jenkins wrote.At least 290 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Workers are asking for better pay, more consistent schedules and safer stores, among other things. Starbucks and the union have not yet reached a contract agreement at any of those stores.The company opposes unionization, saying it already provides industry-leading benefits and its stores function better when it works directly with its employees.The effort has been contentious. Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing workers, has filed 509 unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of firing union organizers, spying on workers and taking other actions to hinder the union campaign. The company has filed 102 charges against the union and says it's failing to bargain in good faith.Last week, a federal labor judge found that the company violated U.S. labor laws ""hundreds of times"" during the unionization campaign in Buffalo, New York. The judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven fired workers and required Schultz to read or be present at a reading of employee rights and distribute a recording of the reading to all of Starbucks' U.S. employees.Schultz is a longtime Starbucks CEO who built the company from a small Seattle chain into a global coffee giant. He came out of retirement last year to assume the interim CEO job after Starbucks' previous CEO retired. Laxman Narasimhan, a former PepsiCo executive, will become Starbucks’ new CEO on April 1, but Schultz plans to remain on the company’s board.]"

The stock hit a new 52-week high of $364.26 in the previous session. Parker-Hannifin has gained 23.9% since the start of the year compared to the 7.8% move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 10.2% return for the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 2, 2023, Parker-Hannifin reported EPS of $4.76 versus consensus estimate of $4.45 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.78%.For the current fiscal year, Parker-Hannifin is expected to post earnings of $19.60 per share on $18.47 billion in revenues. This represents a 4.7% change in EPS on a 16.46% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $21.06 per share on $19.24 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 7.43% and 4.14%, respectively.Valuation MetricsParker-Hannifin may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Parker-Hannifin has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 20.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.4X versus its peer group's average of 13.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Parker-Hannifin currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Parker-Hannifin meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Parker-Hannifin shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While raw material cost inflation poses a threat to the bottom line, pricing actions augur well for the company’s top-line growth.Strength in long-cycle businesses is driving growth in Honeywell’s commercial aviation, building products, advanced materials and UOP businesses. Despite cost inflation, pricing actions and cost-control measures are driving the company’s margin performance. For 2022, operating margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) year over year while the segment margin expanded 70 bps. For 2023, the company expects a segment margin of 22.2-22.6%, indicating a year-over-year rise of 50-90 bps.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s bullish 2023 guidance holds promise. For 2023, the company expects sales of $36-$37 billion, which reflects an organic sales growth of 2-5%. The company anticipates adjusted earnings of $9.35-$9.75 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 7-11%. The company expects moderation in raw material inflation (thanks to deceleration in inflation) and improved supply chains to drive top-line growth in 2023.While Honeywell’s Safety and Productivity Solutions segment is experiencing weakness due to lower personal protective equipment and warehouse automation volume, its Aerospace segment is witnessing robust growth on the back of strong commercial aftermarket demand. Continued improvement in flight hours, especially in wide body, should continue to drive the segment’s performance. For 2023, the company expects segmental organic growth to be in the high single-digit to the low double-digit range.Strength in advanced materials business and UOP operations is fueling growth of HON’s Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT) segment. An improvement in the process technologies business, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter, robust catalyst shipments and demand for energy capacity should drive the PMT segment’s growth in 2023. Within PMT, growth in the advanced materials business is expected to continue owing to strong demand for solstice products. For 2023, the company expects sales to improve in the mid-single digits for PMT.Honeywell has been committed to handsomely rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In 2022, HON rewarded shareholders with $2.7 billion in dividends and $4.2 billion in share buybacks. The quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 5.1% in September 2022. Strong free cash flow generation supports the company’s shareholder-friendly activities. The company expects an operating cash flow of $4.9-$5.3 billion for 2023, while the free cash flow is anticipated to be $3.9-$4.3 billion.Backed by these tailwinds, shares of Honeywell have gained 8.1% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 4.2% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks worth considering are as follows:Deere &amp; Company DE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The guidance includes the expectations of macroeconomic volatility and a potential decline in food-away-from-home demand.Other Players Grappling With InflationMany consumer staple companies are bearing the brunt of cost inflation. For instance, Campbell Soup CPB has been battling major cost hurdles. CPB expects to keep witnessing cost inflation throughout fiscal 2023. Campbell Soup’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 30 basis points (bps) to 32.2% in the first quarter due to continued cost inflation and increased other supply-chain costs and an unfavorable volume/ mix.B&amp;G Foods BGS has been battling cost inflation, which is weighing on its gross margin. On its last earnings call, management stated that it anticipates inflation to linger in fiscal 2023 but at reduced rates (5-6%). It expects increased pressure on the prices of tomatoes and glass, among others. Also, B&amp;G Foods continues to see increased prices of core commodities, such as soybean oil, wheat and corn to name a few.Flowers Foods FLO is battling major hurdles due to cost inflation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, FLO’s materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) escalated by bps to 53.2% on rising input cost inflation. Flowers Foods expects inflation to continue in 2023 at a declining pace.Story continuesSysco’s Recipe for Growth a BreatherSysco’s Recipe for Growth program involves five strategic priorities aimed at enabling the company to grow 1.5 times faster than the market by FY24 end.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Companies that Just Started Paying DividendsMotley Fool's High Growth Stock Picks13 High Growth Consumer Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

Southwest will use AWS to power elements of its website and mobile app, store data and run internal analytics. The companies declined to discuss financial terms of the multiyear deal.Southwest already runs some software on AWS, including gate management and departure control programs, said Lauren Woods, the low-cost airline’s chief information officer. “We definitely have plans to do other critical-for-operations and future required-to-fly applications, bringing those into AWS,” Woods said.Southwest faced widespread criticism from customers and industry regulators and was called before a congressional committee after it scrubbed more than 16,700 flights in the final 10 days of December. At the time, the Dallas-based airline was contending with a powerful winter storm that moved across the northern US, grounding flights and causing Southwest to lose track of its aircraft and flight crews.The situation became so bad that the airline canceled the majority of its schedule over several days to reset its flight network, affecting more than 2 million passengers. The meltdown will cost the airline at least $1.15 billion over two quarters due to scrapped reservations, reduced bookings and higher costs.Story continuesAmazon and Southwest were having talks to expand their relationship before the scheduling fiasco, said Matt Garman, AWS’s senior vice president of sales and marketing. “It’s not like this stuff happened in December and they jumped with us,” he said. “It’s really kind of a full modernization of a lot of their flight operations.”AWS is the world’s largest cloud provider, selling rented computing power, data storage and software services to businesses — including some that have decommissioned their own data centers in favor of Amazon’s server farms. The company often touts deals with marquee customers like airlines. United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. also named AWS their preferred cloud partner in recent years.Southwest has said that its existing technology didn’t fail during the December disruptions, but that cancellations built so rapidly that crew scheduling software from GE Digital, a unit of General Electric Co., was overwhelmed. That software was upgraded in February to correct the deficiency. Woods was named Southwest’s CIO on Feb. 1.Southwest is the target of a federal probe into whether the carrier’s scheduling violated rules forbidding unfair and deceptive practices when it left millions stranded. The airline is awaiting the results of a report it commissioned from consultant Oliver Wyman on what went wrong.Woods said Southwest plans to maintain its own data center, in part to keep its options open to run some of the applications from its wide range of software vendors.“The footprint may get smaller,” she said. “I just don’t see it going to zero.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNext Big Job Cuts Will Be in Finance and Health Care, Data ShowThe Digital Age Ushers in a Speedier, More Viral Breed of Bank RunThe Biggest Winner of the Gas Stove Fight Is Induction RangesThe Promise of Higher Pay Woos MBAs, Yet Earnings Haven’t Kept Up With InflationEven Wealthy Landlords Are Skipping Payments on Office Buildings©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

""With the help of AWS’s leading cloud technology and expertise, we will launch improved digital solutions, responsive customer support, and streamlined operations as we deliver on our digital transformation initiatives.""Deepening Value for CustomersSouthwest uses their website and app to directly reach passengers, resulting in more than 83% of revenue coming from these channels. Using AWS, the airline will harness the automatic scaling capabilities of cloud technology to more efficiently process real-time fare searches on its website and mobile app. This helps customers easily and securely find and book fares quickly, even during periods of peak traffic.The airline aims to provide next-generation customer service and employee tools in a test-and-learn capacity through their Innovation Lab powered by AWS.

Utilizing AWS’s leading availability and reliability, the new system was able to handle the scale and processing needed to offer competitive fare recommendations to customers across partner and Southwest digital properties.Story continuesIn the future, Southwest also plans to leverage AWS technologies, such as analytics and machine learning, to improve the speed to market of new digital innovations to best support customers from shopping for fares to arrival at their destination.Optimizing Flight OperationsSouthwest plans to utilize the full power of AWS as a development platform to deliver automated, scalable, and secure solutions. The airline is implementing a modernized data architecture using Amazon Redshift, a cloud data warehouse, to deliver analytics capabilities for analysts, data scientists, and business users to gain real-time and predictive insights across its entire operations. To better harness this data, Southwest developers are creating a self-service machine learning platform using Amazon SageMaker to enable data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. The internal platform will provide additional insights to expedite the development of new tools and products for employees and customers. In addition, the airline will use AWS storage, container, and serverless compute services to optimize operational applications that support gate assignments, ground operations, flight operations, and aircraft maintenance. All of this will mean a more seamless and enjoyable travel experience for Southwest’s customers.""Southwest Airlines is one of the world’s largest low-cost carriers, operating 4,000 flights daily during peak travel season,"" said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at AWS. ""AWS’s proven experience in the travel industry, coupled with our vast portfolio of cloud technologies, empowers Southwest to increase operational resiliency, drive cost efficiency, and deliver exceptional experiences for its employees and customers. Our shared culture of customer obsession will help Southwest innovate new travel solutions that will enhance customer touchpoints, flight operations, and airplane and crew scheduling, to keep air travel affordable and enjoyable for passengers.""About Amazon Web ServicesSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Companies that Just Started Paying DividendsMotley Fool's High Growth Stock Picks13 High Growth Consumer Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) share price is up 22% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. In the last year the stock has gained 6.4%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Philip Morris International achieved compound earnings per share growth of 8.1% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Philip Morris International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Philip Morris International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Philip Morris International, it has a TSR of 44% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Philip Morris International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The money could be received by Cuba inhabitants from three of the country’s government-operated banks – Banco Popular de Ahorro, Banco Metropolitano S.A. and Banco de Credito y Comercio.Earlier restricted to a limited group, over 4,400 retail locations throughout the United States and Puerto Rico are now equipped to send remittances to Cuba with the latest program expansion. However, only consumer money transfers can be conducted between the United States and Cuba for the time being.Also, the latest announcement kept the maximum remittance that a U.S. customer can transfer to Cuba by furnishing valid government-issued identification unaltered at $2,000 per transaction.Through WesternUnion.com or the Western Union mobile app, U.S. customers are now empowered to send money digitally to Cuba. This lucrative opportunity of digital money transfer comes as a benefit of the significant program expansion. Consequent to such a promising expansion, WU holds plans to further bolster the program reach in 2023. Western Union seems prudent in resorting to reactivation of services to Cuba since discontinuation of money transfer services might reduce the consideration that WU receives from customers for transferring money. Money transfer revenues account for a significant chunk of WU’s top line.The recent announcement serves a dual purpose of easing Cuba’s families to receive economic support in form of remittances through one of the world’s leading money movement companies and provide some respite to WU’s revenues in the days ahead.A solid cross-border money transfer platform built on the back of several partnerships and significant investments enables Western Union in bringing about seamless money movement to and from any corner of the world.Story continuesThe platform reaches more than 200 countries and territories, further reinstating the belief that individuals from all across the globe put on Western Union while engaging in remittances. Despite being in possession of a credible money transfer platform, WU leaves no stone unturned to collaborate with retail chains or financial service providers with an aim to further fortify its worldwide network.Shares of Western Union have lost 26.8% in a year against the industry’s 8.1% growth.

TransDigm Group has gained 22.3% since the start of the year compared to the 1.9% move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the 7.2% return for the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 7, 2023, TransDigm reported EPS of $4.58 versus consensus estimate of $4.31.For the current fiscal year, TransDigm is expected to post earnings of $22.26 per share on $6.14 billion in revenues. This represents a 29.87% change in EPS on a 13.18% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $26 per share on $6.67 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.83% and 8.56%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTransDigm may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.TransDigm has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 34.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 23X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 37.9X versus its peer group's average of 15.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.91. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, TransDigm currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if TransDigm meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though TransDigm shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.28bUS$1.59bUS$1.81bUS$1.93bUS$2.02bUS$2.09bUS$2.15bUS$2.21bUS$2.26bUS$2.32bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 3.43%Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$41bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$41b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$19bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$32b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$770, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TransDigm Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.977. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TransDigm GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For TransDigm Group, there are three additional aspects you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Simon Property Group How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Simon Property Group is:64% = US$2.5b ÷ US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.64 in profit.Does Simon Property Group Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Simon Property Group has a better ROE than the average (6.7%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Simon Property Group's Debt And Its 64% Return On EquityIt appears that Simon Property Group makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 6.53. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Simon Property Group may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:HCA) looks like a potentially compelling opportunity. As a prominent operator of hospital chains in the U.S., the company should maintain consistent returns regardless of market conditions since medical care cannot always be deferred.Therefore, HCA's prospects may remain favorable even during a recession, making it a potentially attractive investment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with XOM. Click here to check it out. HCA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HCAPeter Lynch Chart of HCASo far this year, however, the stock has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 as rising wages have pressured the company's financial results. With the labor market continuing to be tight, investors, understandably, are on the fence.HCA Healthcare Is Set for Secular GrowthThere are some factors working in its favor, however.An aging populationAs a leading provider of health care services, HCA Healthcare is well positioned to take advantage of the aging population. The U.S. has been experiencing a demographic shift, with a growing proportion comprised of individuals aged 65 and over. This group tends to require more health care services than younger individuals due to the higher incidence of chronic conditions and age-related ailments. As a result, health care spending is expected to rise in the coming years.Moreover, HCA has been proactively investing in new facilities and technologies to cater to the specific needs of this population. For example, the company has been expanding its geriatric psychiatry services to meet the growing demand for mental health care among the elderly as well as developing specialized programs for treating Alzheimer's and dementia patients.Further, HCA recently launched two initiatives to improve patient outcomes and boost its bottom line.The first initiative is the Enhanced Surgical Recovery program, which takes a multidisciplinary approach to surgical recovery. The program has shown remarkable improvements in surgical recovery, resulting in a 44% decrease in opioid usage following surgeries.Story continuesWhile a decrease in the length of hospital stays could mean lower spending, the Enhanced Surgical Recovery program is designed to improve the patient experience, which can lead to a significant percentage of customer retention.The second initiative is the adoption of Azra AI technology as a vendor for artificial intelligence technologies that can help decrease the time between cancer diagnosis and the first treatment. The technology can reduce the wait time from weeks to days, which can be critical for patients with aggressive forms of cancer.Both of these initiatives can potentially improve patient outcomes and boost the company's bottom line. By adopting innovative technologies and a patient-centered approach, HCA Healthcare can establish a competitive advantage in the health care industry and attract more patients in the long run. Further, these initiatives demonstrate the company's commitment to meeting the evolving health care needs of the aging population and positioning itself as a leading provider of health care services.Labor costs are likely to go down this yearHCA Healthcare has been facing significant challenges due to the rising labor costs in recent quarters. During the last fiscal year, salaries and benefits rose 3.33% to $27.68 billion, representing 46% of sales.The company has been struggling to keep its labor costs in check as inflation has been driving up the cost of everything, including wages, benefits and other employee-related expenses. In addition, the labor shortage for hospital staff is crippling.Labor costs are a significant portion of HCA Healthcare's expenses, and any increase in these costs can significantly impact the company's bottom line. This is because, unlike other businesses, hospitals cannot change their prices frequently. Based on negotiations with insurers and Medicare, they are locked in for several months or even a year.The rising labor costs have been putting pressure on HCA Healthcare's profitability, as the company has had to spend more on employee wages and benefits. As a result, the company has been forced to implement cost-cutting measures and other initiatives to improve its financial performance.Despite a challenging first half of 2022, HCA's second half was decent due to decreased wage pressure and moderating contract labor costs. The company's full-year 2022 revenue totaled $60.23 billion, compared to $58.75 billion in 2021; its net income dropped to $5.64 billion from the previous year's $6.95 billion.To address the issue of rising labor costs, HCA Healthcare has been focusing on increasing efficiency and productivity across its operations. The company has been investing in technology and other initiatives to streamline its processes and reduce its reliance on labor-intensive tasks.In addition, HCA Healthcare's labor costs are predicted to decline as the pandemic subsides and inflation gradually improves, though the company has no control over those two factors. Larger macroeconomic trends are at play that are expected to cool the labor market. For instance, the Federal Reserve has taken measures to address inflation and job market issues by increasing interest rates.Despite this, the job market has remained strong, with the economy adding 568,000 more jobs in the 12 months through March 2022 and nonfarm payrolls increasing by 517,000 in January. The unemployment rate has also decreased to 3.4%, while average hourly earnings have increased by 0.3% and 4.4% year over year.Using cash effectivelyHCA's dividend yield is lower than that of the health care sector, standing at 0.89% (as of writing) compared to the sector's average yield of 1.92%. However, despite the challenging economic environment, the company has demonstrated an ability to increase its dividend yield for the past three years. HCA increased its quarterly dividend from 56 cents per share to 60 cents on Jan. 27.While HCA has a track record of paying special dividends, share repurchases have been a better source of shareholder returns. Share repurchases help to improve the company's return on assets, provide tax benefits and ultimately lead to a higher share price - especially if the repurchased shares are retired.In the fourth quarter of 2022, HCA repurchased $1.51 billion worth of stock, leaving $1.586 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program as of Dec. 31. For the entire fiscal year, the company's board of directors authorized an additional buyback program worth $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock without an expiration date.Since December 2013, HCA has bought back more than 45% of its outstanding share capital, significantly contributing to its long-term earnings per share growth. Despite margin pressures, the company's financial results continue to remain strong.These measures, along with the company's increasing dividend yield, bode well for HCA's shareholders and its financial performance in the future.TakeawayHCA Healthcare appears to be a compelling option for investors looking for exposure to a company that will benefit from a decelerating labor market and has limited cyclical risk while actively repurchasing its stock.Although the industry may continue to experience challenges in short to medium term, value investors may find HCA Healthcare's current share price attractive. Despite the rally over the last six months, shares of the company appear undervalued and recent declines could be viewed as a potential opportunity.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

A credible healthcare services portfolio that can be availed at ACHC’s acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, specialty treatment facilities, comprehensive treatment centers (CTCs) and residential treatment centers are likely to pave long-term growth for ACHC.Continued incidence of mental health issues among Americans is expected to sustain the solid demand for behavioral healthcare services.

Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year.

Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector.

Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.14%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.18%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.54%.Heading into today, shares of the investment bank had lost 7.56% over the past month, lagging the Finance sector's loss of 4.43% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.07% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Goldman Sachs as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Goldman Sachs to post earnings of $8.62 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 19.89%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.28 billion, up 2.69% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $32.95 per share and revenue of $50.37 billion, which would represent changes of +9.61% and +6.34%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.94% higher. Goldman Sachs is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Looking at its valuation, Goldman Sachs is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 10.5. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.61, which means Goldman Sachs is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that GS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.33.

198,00a4e368-d744-36fb-b682-e799fcdb170d,GS,2023-03-09,Why Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-goldman-sachs-gs-great-164504691.html,1678293904,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Goldman Sachs in FocusGoldman Sachs (GS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 0.79% since the start of the year. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $2.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.89% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.39% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.69%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.39%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Goldman's payout ratio is 33%, which means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.GS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $32.95 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 9.61%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

199,077a75db-c40d-3d45-9bbc-6b8933d6150a,GS,2023-03-09,Goldman Sachs raises rate estimates following Fed Chair Powell’s testimony,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/goldman-sachs-raises-rate-estimates-141808443.html,1678285088,VIDEO,['GS'],"[Yahoo Finance Live’s Julie Hyman and Ines Ferre discuss how banks are reacting to Fed Chair Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of bigger interest rate hikes as the central bank looks to tackle stubborn inflation. His hawkish comments were made at a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday.JEROME POWELL: Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous FOMC meeting. The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If a totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we'd be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes. Congress really needs to raise the debt ceiling. That's the only way out.JOHN KENNEDY: You're raising interest rates to slow the economy. Are you not?JEROME POWELL: Yes, to cool the economy off.JOHN KENNEDY: So in effect-- I'm not being critical. When you're slowing the economy, you're trying to put people out of work. That's your job. Is it not?JEROME POWELL: Not really. We're trying to restore price stability. I think nothing about the data suggests to me that we've tightened too much. Indeed, it suggests that we still have work to do.ELIZABETH WARREN: How would you explain your view that they need to lose their jobs?JEROME POWELL: I would explain to people, more broadly, that inflation is extremely high, and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. We are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down.ELIZABETH WARREN: And putting 2 million people out of work is just part of the cost, and they just have to bear it?JEROME POWELL: Well, they-- will working people be better off if we just walk away from our jobs and inflation remains 5%, 6%?ELIZABETH WARREN: Well, let me--JULIE HYMAN: Well, that gives you a little summary, set to music, with what we heard from Powell. That was before the Senate Banking Committee, as you saw Senator Elizabeth Warren there questioning Powell. He's heading back to Capitol Hill today for the second round of hearings before the House Financial Services Committee. And Ines, in the wake of his comments yesterday, we have seen a number of banks raise their rate estimates, not necessarily for the meetings incrementally, but the terminal rate as it's called, the place where the Fed is going to end up.Story continuesINES FERRE: Yeah, and one of them being Goldman Sachs basically saying that this-- Powell's testimony is pointing to higher terminal rate, and that opens the door to a faster hiking pace. So Goldman Sachs raising its terminal rate forecast to 5.5% to 5.75%. The Fed policy rate right now is currently at 4 and 1/2% to 4.75% that range. But certainly it's significant that Goldman has increased its forecasts for the terminal rate. It's significant that banks are sort of forecasting like, well, could he now-- could Powell-- could the Fed increase rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting? We had thought it would be 25 basis points.So there's a debate going on on whether or not it will be 50, it'll be 25. Citi was actually fading the 50 basis point hike narrative, saying that we like to fade the 50 basis point hike narrative as, in our view, it would essentially mean that the Fed is giving up on a soft landing. And that goes in part with what Jerome Powell was saying yesterday, as well, when he was really being pressed about the unemployment. So unemployment has to go up. So people have to lose their jobs. You're saying 2 million people have to lose their jobs. So by them raising by 50 basis points, are they giving up on that soft landing narrative?JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And then he, of course, pushed back against that and saying, well, these people are losing their jobs, but what's better, for them to be continuing to pay ever higher rates of inflation, right? So it's obviously a dilemma. One other quick note here as we talk about rates going higher for longer and the expectations were hard or soft landing is that we now have a yield curve steeper in inversion, or deeper in inversion, I should say. That means the yield on the 10 year minus the yield on the 2 year as an indicator of recession. We're going to talk more about this later in the show. But it is something that economists and strategists are watching very closely.]"

""With more limited take rate upside and deteriorating buyer trends, we see downside to consensus from slowing top line and moderating margin expansion.""Colantuoni slashed his price target on Etsy to $85 from $150.

Used vehicle seller CarMax is summarizing thousands of customer reviews with the same “generative” AI technology that powers the popular chatbot ChatGPT.Meanwhile, Snapchat is bringing a chatbot to its messaging service. And the grocery delivery company Instacart is integrating ChatGPT to answer customers' food questions.Coca-Cola plans to use generative AI to help create new marketing content. And while the company hasn’t detailed exactly how it plans to deploy the technology, the move reflects the growing pressure on businesses to harness tools that many of their employees and consumers are already trying on their own.“We must embrace the risks,” said Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey in a recent video announcing a partnership with startup OpenAI — maker of both DALL-E and ChatGPT — through an alliance led by the consulting firm Bain. “We need to embrace those risks intelligently, experiment, build on those experiments, drive scale, but not taking those risks is a hopeless point of view to start from.”Indeed, some AI experts warn that businesses should carefully consider potential harms to customers, society and their own reputations before rushing to embrace ChatGPT and similar products in the workplace.“I want people to think deeply before deploying this technology,” said Claire Leibowicz of The Partnership on AI, a nonprofit group founded and sponsored by the major tech providers that recently released a set of recommendations for companies producing AI-generated synthetic imagery, audio and other media. “They should play around and tinker, but we should also think, what purpose are these tools serving in the first place?”Story continuesSome companies have been experimenting with AI for a while. Mattel revealed its use of OpenAI’s image generator in October as a client of Microsoft, which has a partnership with OpenAI that enables it to integrate its technology into Microsoft’s cloud computing platform.But it wasn’t until the November 30 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a free public tool, that widespread interest in generative AI tools began seeping into workplaces and executive suites.“ChatGPT really sort of brought it home how powerful they were,” said Eric Boyd, a Microsoft executive who leads its AI platform. ”That’s changed the conversation in a lot of people’s minds where they really get it on a deeper level. My kids use it and my parents use it.”There is reason for caution, however. While text generators like ChatGPT and Microsoft's Bing chatbot can make the process of writing emails, presentations and marketing pitches faster and easier, they also have a tendency to confidently present misinformation as fact. Image generators trained on a huge trove of digital art and photography have raised copyright concerns from the original creators of those works.“For companies that are really in the creative industry, if they want to make sure that they have copyright protection for (the outputs of) those models, that’s still an open question,” said attorney Anna Gressel of the law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, which advises businesses on how to use AI.A safer use has been thinking of the tools as a brainstorming “thought partner” that won’t produce the final product, Gressel said.“It helps create mock ups that then are going to be turned by a human into something that is more concrete,” she said.And that also helps ensure that humans don't get replaced by AI. Forrester analyst Rowan Curran said the tools should speed up some of the “nitty-gritty” of office tasks — much like previous innovations such as word processors and spell checkers — rather than putting people out of work, as some fear.“Ultimately it’s part of the workflow,"" Curran said. ""It’s not like we’re talking about having a large language model just generate an entire marketing campaign and have that launch without expert senior marketers and all kinds of other controls.”For consumer-facing chatbots getting integrated into smartphone apps, it gets a little trickier, Curran said, with a need for guardrails around technology that can respond to users' questions in unexpected ways.Public awareness fueled growing competition between cloud computing providers Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which sell their services to big organizations and have the massive computing power needed to train and operate AI models. Microsoft announced earlier this year it was investing billions more dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, though it also competes with the startup as a direct provider of AI tools.Google, which pioneered advancements in generative AI but has been cautious about introducing them to the public, is now playing catch up to capture its commercial possibilities including an upcoming Bard chatbot. Facebook parent Meta, another AI research leader, builds similar technology but doesn't sell it to businesses in the same way as its big tech peers.Amazon has taken a more muted tone, but makes its ambitions clear through its partnerships — most recently an expanded collaboration between its cloud computing division AWS and the startup Hugging Face, maker of a ChatGPT rival called Bloom.Hugging Face decided to double down on its Amazon partnership after seeing the explosion of demand for generative AI products, said Clement Delangue, the startup's co-founder and CEO. But Delangue contrasted his approach with competitors such as OpenAI, which doesn’t disclose its code and datasets.Hugging Face hosts a platform that allows developers to share open-source AI models for text, image and audio tools, which can lay the foundation for building different products. That transparency is ""really important because that’s the way for regulators, for example, to understand these models and be able to regulate,” he said.It is also a way for “underrepresented people to understand where the biases can be (and) how the models have been trained,” so that the bias can be mitigated, Delangue said.]"

""STEM is a field where women are severely underrepresented, and our hope is that honoring these seven leaders in science and technology will encourage girls to follow their passion in this field. This International Women’s Day, we’re proud to continue our work in closing the Dream Gap and reminding girls of their limitless potential.""The Barbie brand’s lineup of global female role models includes three exceptional sisters from the United States – Susan, Anne, and Janet Wojcicki – who can serve as inspiration in a variety of STEM fields for the next generation of women leaders. The full global lineup being honored with one-of-a-kind Barbie dolls made in their likeness includes:Story continuesSusan Wojcicki (United States): Longtime YouTube CEOAnne Wojcicki (United States): Co-Founder and CEO of 23andMEJanet Wojcicki (United States): Professor of Pediatrics and Epidemiology at the University of California, San FranciscoKatya Echazarreta (Mexico): Electrical Engineer and Science Show HostDr Maggie Aderin-Pocock (United Kingdom): Space Scientist and Science EducatorProf Dr Antje Boetius (DE): Marine Researcher and MicrobiologistYinuo Li (China): Co-Founder of ETU Education""It feels surreal that my family’s stories might interest and impact the lives of girls worldwide. My sisters were some of my strongest role models growing up and we all built careers based on our interest in STEM. Our parents fostered independence and a belief that we could truly be anything we wanted to be when I grew up, but most important was to pursue a passion,"" said Anne Wojcicki, Co-Founder and CEO of 23andME. ""I’m honored to celebrate International Women’s Day this year with Barbie alongside my family and these other powerful women in STEM leadership roles. I hope that sharing our stories encourages young girls to try something new, face something that may scare them, and look at challenges as exciting opportunities.""""I understand firsthand that role models are essential for young girls to see what’s possible. When I was starting my career, I struggled to find inspiring stories of other women excelling in STEM – and especially in epidemiology,"" said Janet Wojcicki, Professor of Pediatrics and Epidemiology, UCSF. ""I have been impressed with the increasing global relevance of Barbies for girls from all communities and seen firsthand through my work the relevance of Barbie for sub-Saharan African and Latinx girls. I’m honored to serve as a Barbie role model this year and help children worldwide see women in places that they might want to be in one day.""""Growing up, I didn’t imagine that I would have a career in tech,"" said Susan Wojcicki, Longtime YouTube CEO. ""My sisters and I found jobs we love and discovered how creative and fulfilling careers in STEM can be for women. I spent nearly 25 years working at Google and nine years as the CEO of YouTube, and it was an incredible experience. I hope Barbie’s International Women’s Day celebration will remind girls around the world that they can do anything.""Barbie worked with Susan Wojcicki on a YouTube-produced custom ""Short"" content. In the video, Susan answers questions on empowerment and shares the lessons she’s learned along the way to becoming a top tech CEO.In addition, Barbie will pay tribute to all these global role models through a special episode of the Barbie You Can Be Anything Series – an inspiring digital series featuring conversations with female role models – with Anne Wojcicki as she shares the fun of science, genetics, and DNA with kids from the Boys and Girls Club.In further commitment to leveling the playing field for girls globally, Barbie established the Barbie Dream Gap Project in 2018, a multi-year global initiative created to raise awareness around limiting factors that prevent girls from reaching their full potential. Since launching, the brand has committed over 1.5 million dollars through the Barbie Dream Gap Project to nonprofit partners on a mission to achieve equality by fueling education, leadership skills and mentorship opportunities for girls.* According to the United States Census Bureau ** According to the American Association of University WomenAbout MattelMattel is a leading global toy company and owner of one of the strongest catalogs of children’s and family entertainment franchises in the world.

209,d07995b2-d04c-3daf-ade8-2679fedccf62,SLB,2023-03-09,Is Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-nyse-slb-using-too-110027242.html,1678359627,STORY,['SLB'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Much Debt Does Schlumberger Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Schlumberger had debt of US$12.2b at the end of December 2022, a reduction from US$14.2b over a year. However, it also had US$2.89b in cash, and so its net debt is US$9.33b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Schlumberger's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Schlumberger had liabilities of US$12.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.89b and US$7.03b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$15.2b.Since publicly traded Schlumberger shares are worth a very impressive total of US$76.4b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Schlumberger's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.6), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 10.6 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. On top of that, Schlumberger grew its EBIT by 50% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Schlumberger can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Schlumberger produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 68% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewThe good news is that Schlumberger's demonstrated ability to grow its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its interest cover also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Schlumberger's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Schlumberger .When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.47%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had gained 6.36% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 2.44% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2% in that time.Schlumberger will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Schlumberger to post earnings of $0.60 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 76.47%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.55 billion, up 26.64% from the prior-year quarter.SLB's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.02 per share and revenue of $32.74 billion.

211,dff4ce10-13b0-3f51-b8cd-9a7a17ec4039,SLB,2023-03-09,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limited-slb-attracting-investor-140002975.html,1678111202,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.5%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +25.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Schlumberger is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +26.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.74 billion and $36.4 billion estimates indicate +16.5% and +11.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.6%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was +2.9%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This innovative technology eliminates up to 85 percent of embodied CO2 emissions compared with conventional well cementing systems, which include portland cement. The EcoShield system has the potential to avoid up to 5 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually—the equivalent of removing 1.1 million cars from the road each year.""Decarbonizing the well construction process while ensuring safety and performance standards is critical to our industry’s pathway to net zero,"" said Jesus Lamas, SLB’s president of Well Construction. ""The cement-free EcoShield system is a breakthrough that delivers industry-standard zonal isolation capabilities while significantly minimizing impact from upstream oil and gas production.""In addition to its embodied CO2 emissions, portland cement creates significant transportation-related emissions from manufacture to deployment. The EcoShield system uses locally sourced natural materials and industrial waste streams in its composition, making this a far more sustainable well integrity method.The cement-free system can be deployed throughout various phases of the well life cycle including abandonment. It can also be deployed across a range of field applications, including corrosive environments.In the Permian Basin, Pioneer Natural Resources successfully deployed SLB’s novel cement-free technology on an 18-well field testing campaign and continues with its use. This successful pilot program in North America proved the performance of this unique cement free solution while substantially reducing the CO2 footprint in the well construction process. Field trials validated the ability of the technology to fit within standard oilfield cementing workflows without major changes to the design process, onsite execution, or post-job evaluation.Story continuesThe EcoShield system is part of the SLB Transition Technologies™ portfolio, which includes proven technologies that drive high performance while reducing CO2 emissions. Today’s announcement was made as part of CERAWeek, the world’s premier energy event taking place in Houston through March 10. Many of this week’s topics are centered on the energy transition and the challenges surrounding scalability.""EcoShield is an example of forward-thinking, innovative solutions that will be able to be scaled and deployed in order to help continue the decarbonization of the oil and gas industry,"" Katharina Beumelburg, SLB’s Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer said. ""These types of more sustainable, lower-carbon technologies are critically important today as we continue to discover and develop the new energy solutions of tomorrow.""About SLBSLB (NYSE: SLB) is a global technology company that drives energy innovation for a balanced planet.

Our financial strength gives us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate challenging markets while investing in long-term opportunities.”Quarter in DetailsLeggett reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share, which lagged the consensus estimate of 48 cents by 18.8% and decreased 49% from 77 cents reported a year ago. Lower EBIT, a higher tax rate and higher interest expenses affected the bottom line.Net trade sales of $1.196 billion also missed the consensus mark of $1.22 billion by 2% and declined 10% from the prior-year quarter’s levels of $1.33 billion. Organically, sales were down 12% year over year. Raw material-related selling prices added 2% and acquisitions, net of small divestitures, contributed 2% to sales growth. Volume declined by 12% due to continued demand softness in residential end markets, partially offset by growth in the Automotive, Aerospace, and Hydraulic Cylinders businesses. Currency also impacted sales by 2%.Adjusted EBIT declined 40.1% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $91.2 million. The downside was due to lower volume and reduced overhead absorption as LEG intentionally cut production in the Steel Rod business to reduce inventory levels.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 380 basis points (bps) to 7.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin also declined 350 bps to 11.4%.Story continuesSegment DetailsNet trade sales in Bedding Products (excluding intersegment sales) decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $522.4 million. A volume decline of 19% was caused by softness in the United States and European demand as well as lower demand in the Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses. Increased prices contributed 1% amid a 1% decline from currency fluctuation. Organically, sales were down 19% year over year.Adjusted EBIT margin fell 590 bps to 5.8%. Adjusted EBITDA margin also fell 510 bps year over year to 10.8%.The Specialized Products segment's trade sales rose 15% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $302.8 million. Volume increased by 10% across the segment. A favorable selling price increased sales by 4% and Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition contributed 10%. Currency impact lowered sales by 9%. Organically, sales were up 5% year over year.EBIT margin contracted by 300 bps to 8.7%. EBITDA margin plunged 330 bps year over year to 12.1%.Trade sales in the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment rose 3% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $370.6 million. Volume was down 6%, mainly due to declines in Home Furniture, Fabric Converting and Flooring, partially offset growth in Work Furniture. Raw material-related selling price added 10% to sales, but currency declined sales by 1%. Organically, sales were down 13% year over year.EBIT margin of 8.8% was down 200 bps from the prior year. EBITDA margin also contracted 180 bps to 10.4%.2022 HighlightsNet revenues for the year totaled $5.15 billion, up 1% from $5.07 billion and flat organically year over year. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.27 per share compared with $2.78 in the previous year.Adjusted EBIT fell 14.6% from the prior year to $485 million, owing to lower volume and overhead absorption from reduced production, operational inefficiencies in Specialty Foam and Automotive, and higher raw material and transportation costs. Adjusted EBIT margin also contracted 180 bps from the year-ago figure to 9.4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 200 bps to 12.9%.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $1 billion in liquidity. It had $316.5 million of cash and equivalents in 2022-end compared with $361.7 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt at the 2022-end was $2.07 billion, up 16% from $1.79 from 2021-end. The trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.66x in 2022 versus 2.29x in 2021.Cash from operations for 2022 totaled $441.4 million versus $271.3 million in the prior year.

In 2022, Leggett repurchased 1.7 million shares at an average price of $35.94 and issued 0.9 million shares through employee benefit plans. At the end of 2022, it had 132.6 million outstanding under the repurchase program.Q1 GuidanceFor the first quarter of 2023, earnings per share are anticipated to be down significantly from previous quarter mainly owing to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals and normal seasonality in some of its businesses.2023 GuidanceLeggett expects sales in the range of $4.8–$5.2 billion. This indicates a 7% decline to 1% growth year over year. The raw material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits. Sales are likely to be down low single digit in Bedding Products, up high single digit in Specialized Products and down low single digit in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment. In 2022, acquisitions are expected to add nearly 3% to sales.Earnings are expected to be between $1.50 and $1.90 per share down from 2022 level due to lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, lower volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. The company expects an EBIT margin of 7.5-8%.Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization costs, and operating cash flow are estimated at $100 million, $200 million and $450–500 million, respectively. Dividend and net interest expenses are likely to be $240 million and $85 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year is projected at 24%. Fully diluted shares are projected to be approximately 137 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -46.47% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Legget &amp; Platt has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Packaging Corporation of America's shares on or after the 14th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Packaging Corporation of America stock has a trailing yield of around 3.6% on the current share price of $138.07. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Packaging Corporation of America paid out a comfortable 43% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 63% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Packaging Corporation of America's earnings per share have been growing at 10% a year for the past five years. Packaging Corporation of America has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Packaging Corporation of America has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpHas Packaging Corporation of America got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Packaging Corporation of America paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Packaging Corporation of America looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

215,c4788fe6-1181-3485-8d26-2249ba39458b,APTV,2023-03-09,Nov Inc. (NOV) Down 2.1% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nov-inc-nov-down-2-163004318.html,1678293004,STORY,"['NOV', 'APTV']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nov Inc. (NOV). Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nov Inc. due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.NOV Inc. Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat Estimates in Q4NOV Inc. posted fourth-quarter net income of 26 cents per share, which was 3 cents better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a turnaround from the year-ago loss of 6 cents. The outperformance reflects improving momentum in international markets.NOV’s total revenues of $2.1 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5% and rose 36.7% from the year-ago sales of $1.5 billion.Segment PerformancesRig Technologies: The unit produced $620 million in fourth-quarter revenues, which comfortably went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $550 million and also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $431 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $88 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $62 million and more than quadrupled from the fourth-quarter 2021 figure of $21 million. The segment’s results were buoyed by strong aftermarket operations in tandem with the recovery in global supply chains, plus higher capital equipment deliveries.Wellbore Technologies: NOV’s Wellbore Technologies segment’s revenues of $762 million increased 32.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022 but fell marginally short of the consensus mark (by 0.8%). While the unit’s adjusted EBITDA of $146 million was up 65.9% from the year-earlier quarter’s profit of $88 million, the same missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $162 million. The mixed comparisons could be attributed to solid improvements in the international markets, offset by plateauing North America results, the delayed shipments of drill pipe and motors, plus the related cost escalation to speed up client orders.  Completion &amp; Production Solutions: Compared to a year ago, the segment’s revenues improved 34.4% to $738 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $684 million. Moreover, the unit’s adjusted EBITDA of $66 million skyrocketed from the year-ago quarter’s income of $2 million and came well ahead of the consensus mark of $50 million, primarily due to elevated completion equipment demand, improved response to the supply chain-reply issues, better pricing and the segment’s growing backlog of offshore projects.Story continuesBacklogAt the end of 2022, NOV’s capital equipment order backlog for Rig Technologies was $2.79 billion, including $254 million worth of new orders. The company’s Completion &amp; Production Solutions operations currently have a $1.6 billion backlog, comprising $557 million of new orders.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and long-term debt of $1.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 25.1%.OutlookNOV, which budgeted a capital spending of $275 million this year, remains optimistic about the improving outlook for international and offshore markets in particular. As a result, the company's longer-cycle business orders will likely perk up in 2023 and beyond. Agreed, the current weakness in North American natural gas prices and recession-related headwinds might hinder oilfield activity. However, years of underinvestment and the focus on demand for capacity expansion across oil and gas plays, should stand players like NOV in good stead. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Nov Inc. has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookNov Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNov Inc. is part of the Zacks Technology Services industry. Over the past month, Aptiv PLC (APTV), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Aptiv PLC reported revenues of $4.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $1.27 for the same period compares with $0.56 a year ago.For the current quarter, Aptiv PLC is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, indicating a change of +44.4% from the year-ago quarter.

AIZ is well-poised for growth, driven by increased mobile subscribers in North America, inorganic and organic growth strategies, higher average insured values and effective capital deployment.Continued organic growth across distribution channels, better loss experience from select ancillary products and higher investment income should drive Global Automotive of the Global Lifestyle segment. Connected Living is likely to gain from higher trade-in volumes, higher international earnings and continued mobile subscriber growth in North America.Adjusted EBITDA in Global Lifestyle is expected to grow on the back of increased mobile subscribers in North America and more favorable mobile loss experience in Connected Living as well as higher investment income and favorable loss experience in select ancillary products in Global Automotive.Assurant has adopted inorganic and organic growth strategies to drive the Global Lifestyle segment. In September 2022, Assurant entered into a new multi-year agreement to extend its longstanding partnership with T-Mobile. This contract extension provides it with increased long-term visibility in U.S. mobile business. It gives a greater opportunity to increase repair volumes through more than 500 Cell Phone Repair locations along with the ability to leverage this capability with other U.S. clients.The Global Housing segment should gain from the higher average insured values, policies in force and premium rates in Lender-placed Insurance business, including contributions from a new client.Net investment income is expected to gain from higher income from higher yields on fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents and increased income from commercial mortgage loans on real estate due to a rise in invested assets.Assurant has a strong capital management policy in place. Its solid capital position supports effective capital deployment. At present, $274.5 million remains unused under the repurchase authorization. AIZ expects to deploy capital primarily to support business growth by funding investments, mergers and acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.The multi-line insurer has been experiencing an increase in operating expenses driven by higher policyholder benefits, underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses and goodwill impairment. Such expenses continue to weigh on margin expansion.Story continues2023 GuidanceAssurant expects adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, to increase by low single-digits, with results improving as the year progresses, led by improved performance in Global Housing and more modest growth in Global Lifestyle.Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, is expected to grow from revised 2022 results of $417.4 million.Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow modestly from revised 2022 results of $809.4 million. Lower contributions from international, including the impact of continued foreign exchange headwinds, are expected to pressure results particularly in the first half of 2023.  Assurant expects adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, per diluted share growth rate to be lower than Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes growth. This is due to higher depreciation expense of approximately $114 million and a higher effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 24%, following a $9 million benefit in 2022.Other Industry PlayersOther players in the multi-line insurance industry include Radian Group Inc. RDN, American International Group, Inc. AIG and EverQuote, Inc. EVER.Radian’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 38.62%.Radian remains focused on improving its mortgage insurance portfolio, growing the Homegenius business and managing capital resources. Continued high levels of the new mortgage insurance business, as well as an increase in persistency, is likely to drive the primary insurance in force, the main driver of future earnings for Radian Group.American International’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed in one, the average earnings surprise being 6.94%.American International is well-poised to grow on the back of acquisitions and prudent capital allocation. Improving travel and warranty operations are likely to drive AIG’s personal lines insurance business. Strategic business de-risking and acquisitions, cost-control efforts and accelerated capital deployment will drive American International’s growth.EverQuote’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 39.08%.EverQuote is well-poised for growth owing to the solid performance of automotive and other insurance marketplace verticals. EVER remains focused on rapidly expanding into new verticals. Increasing consumer traffic, higher quote request volume and innovating advertiser products and services will continue to boost revenues.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CAH recently announced its collaboration with Signify Health, Inc. SGFY. The partnership is expected to offer in-home clinical and medication management services via Cardinal Health’s Outcomes business.The collaboration will initially focus on addressing interventions recommended for Medicare Advantage members of joint clients and may expand into additional services (such as population health programs) and clinical interventions.The latest tie-up is expected to significantly strengthen Cardinal Health's medication therapy management services, which is a component of its broader Pharmaceutical segment, on a national scale.Rationale Behind the CollaborationPer Cardinal Health, studies have shown that many members do not take their medications as prescribed. This collaboration is expected to bring together Signify Health's mobile network of credentialed clinicians and Outcomes' OutcomesOne clinical care platform and omnichannel network of pharmacies and payers. This will likely help address medication management challenges for health plan members by offering coordinated care from Signify Health clinicians, who also perform evaluations of those members at home.Cardinal Health’s collaboration with Signify Health will likely aid in reducing costs and eradicate gaps in care for members nationwide to support their treatment journey from prescription to pharmacy and, ultimately, home.Per Cardinal Health’s management, as more patients recover and manage their chronic illnesses from home, the partnership with Signify Health will likely aid in driving more powerful connections across transitions of care. This is expected to enable pharmacies and payers to reach patients requiring additional support.Signify Health’s management believes the tie-up with Cardinal Health will enable it to make the vital service of medication management more convenient, accessible and connected to daily life. It will also likely improve medication safety and adherence and drive more value for the people currently being served by it.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Stratview Research, the global medication management market is projected to grow from $1.68 billion in 2020 to $5.41 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of approximately 21.5%. Factors like the increasing elderly population, increasing adoption of IT in healthcare and a surge in the incidence of chronic and infectious diseases are expected to drive the market.Given the growing market potential, the new collaboration seems to have been timed well.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Cardinal Health announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, where it recorded a solid uptick in its overall top line. Its Pharmaceutical segment’s revenues were also robust, which highlighted branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. The segment also recorded a solid uptick in its profit, driven by generics program performance and a higher contribution from the brand sales mix.In January, Cardinal Health announced its entry into a strategic collaboration with Palantir Technologies Inc. to design a solution that will give health systems and hospitals dynamic purchase decision insights to quickly improve their bottom line.In November 2022, Cardinal Health announced the launch of Velocare, a supply chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution capable of reaching patients in a few hours with critical products and services required for hospital-level care at home.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 37.2% in the past year against the industry’s 6.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500’s 8.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Cardinal Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a few regulatory approvals, is expected to contribute further. Forex woes and significant consolidation persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 10.8% compared with 6.3% decline of the industry and 8.4% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical technology company has a market capitalization of $67.06 billion. It projects 7.8% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. BD has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.5% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Regulatory Approvals: BD has been progressing impressively on the regulatory front, raising our optimism. Last month, the company received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV (human papillomavirus) Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test.The same month, BD received the FDA’s EUA for a new molecular diagnostic combination test for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A + B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus — BD Respiratory Viral Panel assay for BD MAX System.Product Launches: We are upbeat about BD’s slew of product launches in recent times. Last month, the company announced a new instrument for single-cell multiomics analysis — BD Rhapsody HT Xpress System — that will enable scientists to run high-throughput studies without compromising sample integrity.During the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call the same month, BD stated that it had launched PosiFlush SafeScrub, a product in its Medical segment.Strong Q1 Results: BD’s solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy our optimism. An improvement in the overall base revenues and robust performances by the majority of its segments and in the United States were registered. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also witnessed. BD’s recent agreement with Biocorp and a co-exclusive commercial agreement with Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc. raises optimism.Story continuesDownsidesSignificant Consolidation: The medical technology industry has been experiencing a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of BD’s products.Forex Woes: BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD report with respect to its operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. BD cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which it can mitigate such risks.Estimate TrendBD is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.7% north to $12.14.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.66 billion, suggesting a 7% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fiscal second-quarter revenue estimate of $4.64 billion.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Hologic and Edwards Lifesciences are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HOLX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.49, while EW has a forward P/E of 31.28. We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 1.41. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 4.59.Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P/B ratio of 3.89. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 8.39.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to HOLX's Value grade of B and EW's Value grade of C.HOLX stands above EW thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HOLX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SRDX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to reliance on third parties and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 46.4% compared with 37.3% decline of the industry and 5.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $327.1 million. Surmodics projects 46.6% growth for fiscal 2024, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 24.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.In January, Surmodics announced that the differentiated capabilities of its crystalline drug release platform for sirolimus-coated balloons were discussed in connection with 12-month data from its SWING trial at the International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy.Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. During the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in February, Surmodics confirmed that it had recently begun to conduct limited market evaluations to gain experience across a wide variety of cases and clinical conditions and assess the feedback from various physicians. Per management, the real-world feedback thus obtained will help inform future design enhancements that benefit physicians and patients while optimizing its commercial viability.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Surmodics’ better-than-expected earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2023 buoy optimism about the stock. The company registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and royalties and license fees. In October 2022, Surmodics announced its entry into a new, five-year credit agreement with MidCap Financial, which is encouraging.DownsidesReliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The revenues it derives from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Its failure or the failure of its licensees to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on Surmodics’ business.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has narrowed from a loss of $2.37 to a loss of $1.93 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $25.9 million, suggesting a 0.4% decline from the year-ago reported number.This compares to our second-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $26 million, suggesting a 0.2% dip from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Moreover, the company raised its 2023 sales guidance, reflecting continued growth momentum.During the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings update, Walgreens stated that it has launched 24-hour same-day delivery, offering the widest range of retail items for around-the-clock delivery across the country.

Comparable pharmacy sales declined 0.9%, reflecting lower demand for COVID-19 services.  The International segment declined year over year due to an adverse currency impact of 15.4%.In the last few years, the slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens’ margins. In addition, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering its margin on a significant level. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit fell 8.2% year over year. Gross margin contracted 152 basis points to 20.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 105.9%.

Discovery (WBD) feeling the pressure as profitability struggles mount.Unfavorable macroeconomic headwinds and foreign exchange rates, coupled with decreased ad budgets amid a decline in linear TV and digital search trends, put the ad market through a particularly rough 2022.Recent ad market softness comes as media giants like Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) have embraced ad-supported streaming alternatives as the race for subscribers escalates. With losses piling up just as fast.Disney's direct-to-consumer division lost a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1. Paramount (PARA), meanwhile, reported a direct-to-consumer loss of roughly $1.82 billion last year.Warner Bros. Discovery, which is now targeting $4 billion in cost savings over the next two years, reported a net loss of $2.1 billion in the three months ending December 31. The company previously reported a loss of $2.3 billion in Q3 and a $3.4 billion loss in Q2.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.""The ad market feels to me like it's stabilized a bit,"" NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said during the company's latest earnings call in January, pointing to increased improvements in categories like pharmacy, entertainment, and travel. ""We're assuming it will stay weak for the first half of this year and then recover but who knows with this economy.""Advertising revenue within NBCUniversal's media division increased 4% in Q4, primarily due to incremental revenue from the FIFA World Cup as well as an increase in Peacock advertising revenue.Looking ahead, the lack of cyclical events in 2023 such as the World Cup, Olympics, or U.S. midterm elections, will likely be a drag on ad spend in 2023.According to data from media investment and intelligence company Magna Global cited by Forbes, those events greatly aided the battered industry with the domestic ad market totaling $318 billion last year — an increase of 8% compared to 2021. Magna estimates U.S. ad spend will grow by 3.7% in 2023, lower than its September forecast of 4.8%.Story continuesSports, autos, pharma encouragingBob Bakish, Paramount Global CEO, agreed the back half of this year should see an ad market recovery, telling investors during the company's latest earnings call: ""2023 will also be an important year with respect to advertising, where we are looking forward to an improvement in the market in the back half of the year.""""The ad market, as you know, has been cyclically tough and, like our peers, we felt this impact in 2022.""Media executives like Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish have weighed in on the state of the advertising market this earnings seasonAd growth within Paramount's TV media division decreased 7% year-over-year in Q4 amid lower impressions and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Overall, the company saw a 5% decline in quarterly ad revenue after a 2% drop in Q3.Still, Bakish said the company is ""seeing early signs of stabilization in advertising,"" adding: ""The sports marketplace continues to be active across the NFL, PGA, and NCAA. We like what we're seeing in travel and pharma — and recent activity in auto is encouraging.""Looking ahead, the executive warned, ""the combination of streaming investment and the current state of the ad market will impact earnings and cash flow in 2023. We see that narrowing significantly in 2024, resulting in meaningful total company earnings growth and a return to positive free cash flow.""But not every media giant is fully convinced the market will improve.A 'very slow' year for someWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said last month cyclical headwinds and ongoing secular challenges will likely pressure the company in the year ahead, especially as it relates to advertising.Zaslav told investors he expects ad sales to be ""very slow"" in 2023 but, echoing his peers, is hopeful for improvements later this year. WBD's network advertising revenue tumbled by 17% in the fourth quarter, or 14% excluding foreign exchange, after falling 11% (ex foreign exchange) in Q3.Similarly, Spotify (SPOT) CFO Paul Vogel told investors on a Jan. 31 earnings call: ""Advertising in Q4, overall, it's definitely continued to be very up and down.""David Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, talks to reporters upon his arrival for the annual Allen and Co. conference at Sun Valley, Idaho July 9, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS)""In Q4, we outperformed our expectations. Admittedly, those were lowered expectations, [but] we actually outperformed those by about €50 million or so...and even within that we had two months that outperformed and one month that underperformed...it was pretty up and down.""Vogel said he expects similar trends in Q1 and, although the company feels confident about its ad stack and recent acquisitions, he reiterated the macro still remains ""uncertain.""Spotify's Q4 ad-supported revenue, boosted by podcasting, grew 14% on a year-over-year basis to €449 million — accounting for 14% of total revenue.Disney, Netflix embrace ad-supported productsDisney and Netflix debuted their respective ad tiers at a time when the ad market was in flux, but the move seems to have been a lucrative one — at least so far — with positive sentiment from both Wall Street and high-level executives.Disney, which rolled out its ad-supported tier in early December, said it was ""pleased"" with subscribers' initial reaction to the new offering on its latest earnings call.At the time of the debut, the company said over 100 advertisers bought inventory for the launch — bucking the trend of a global ad spend slowdown.CFO Christine McCarthy told investors the ad-tier will not produce ""meaningful financial impact"" until later this fiscal year, but analysts have continuously argued the rollout was a ""critical"" needle mover for revenue.""I think [the ad tier] moves the needle pretty substantially,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan previously told Yahoo Finance. ""It's absolutely very, very critical, and they've done it at the right time.""The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniSimilar to Disney, Netflix is playing the long game when it comes to its recently launched ad-supported tier, which officially debuted in November.The company is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate) but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.According to Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman, the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch. Another sign ad buyers are willing to spend on new growth areas, especially as consumers' viewing habits change.In its latest shareholder letter, Netflix said engagement for ad-supported subscribers ""is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected, and we believe the lower price point is driving incremental membership growth.""Netflix went as far as to say its ad business could be even larger than Hulu's, with CFO Spencer Neumann telling investors: ""It's a multi-year path. We're not going to be larger than Hulu in year one, but, hopefully, over the next several years, we can be at least as large.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Others say it's still up and down. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with more. Allie, which is it? What's going on?ALEXANDRA CANAL: The moral of the story is here, we don't know. But this has been top of mind for investors because this shaky ad market, it has impacted results, both in the fourth quarter and really all of 2022. So I listened in on all of these recent earnings calls, and here are some of the top takeaways from these media executives. Number one, most media execs believe we will see the ad market improve in the back half of 2023 and that things will still be up and down in the first half, similar to what we saw in Q4.That being said, a lack of cyclical events, such as the World Cup, in addition to the Olympics and the US midterm elections, that will all likely be a drag on ad spend this year. So something to keep in mind as we monitor the progress of this recovery. Areas of strength in the market so far include sports, pharma, travel, and most recently, autos, as the chip market has seen more improvements there.But overall, the macro still remains uncertain. And none of these executives could really give a firm prediction of the future here. But if we take a look back to 2022, recent data from media investment and intelligence company Magna Global estimated the domestic ad market totaled 318 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2021, largely due to those cyclical events.For 2023, Magna estimates US ad spend will grow by 3.7%, lower than its September forecast of 4.8%, as the economy is expected to remain pressured early in 2023 before picking up as inflation cools. So like I said, it's still to be determined this year. I think in 2024, we're going to have a bit more clarity when it comes to where the ad market stands as those macro conditions improve. But for now, it is encouraging to see at least some optimism from these companies when it comes to the back half of the year.Story continuesINES FERRE: So given the ad market and where we're at there, what does this mean for companies like Disney, like Netflix, which started offering its ad-based-- ad-supported subscriptions?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and that was a really interesting time for these companies to debut their ad-supported tiers, right? We had all these macro concerns. However, a lot of these streaming giants were hemorrhaging money, and they needed ways to supplement their revenue outside of those premium subscription tiers. Advertising is one great way to do that. And from the updates that we've been given so far, it seems like it's working out. We haven't had a lot of details, a lot of specifics at this point, considering both Netflix and Disney rolled out their ad-supported tiers at the end of last year, Netflix in November, Disney in December.But at the time of Disney's debut, the company said over 100 advertisers bought inventory for the launch. Similarly, Netflix revealed it nearly sold out of all of its own ad inventory globally for their respective launch. So multiple signs that ad buyers, they're still willing to spend money where consumers are. And right now, that is on streaming platforms. So I'm sure over the next six months to a year, we're going to get even more updates on how those ad-supported tiers are doing.INES FERRE: I will confess that I signed up for Netflix to watch that Jonah Hill documentary.JULIE HYMAN: You didn't--INES FERRE: I did not like it.JULIE HYMAN: Wait, you didn't have Netflix before?INES FERRE: With the ads.ALEXANDRA CANAL: With the ads.JULIE HYMAN: Oh, with the ads.INES FERRE: With the ads. I didn't like it. I did not like it because if you try to avoid the ads by going somewhere else on your browser, it stops the ad, and then you've got to listen to it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: OK.INES FERRE: So yeah.JULIE HYMAN: I haven't watched a-- I guess I watched the commercials during the Super Bowl. That's the only time I watch commercials. The rest of the time--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Even then, I feel distracted during that.INES FERRE: It's worth it without the ads, I think. It's worth it.]"

I think that's going to end up being a disaster for them,"" Pachter said, noting ""there's no way"" Amazon or Google will make money on the purchase.""I don't think live sports is the way to go. The sports leagues have established that their rights are worth billions of dollars, and Netflix just doesn't have billions to spend on that,"" the analyst said, reiterating: ""We don't think of Netflix as a by-appointment television broadcaster. We think of them as an on-demand, when we feel like it, and binge the whole thing [broadcaster].""Pachter maintains an Outperform rating on Netflix with a $410 price target on the stock — suggesting more than 25% upside compared to current levels.""I love [Netflix's] spirit,"" he said, praising the streamer's recent move into ad-supported which ""will keep people from quitting"" at a time when it's struggled to add subscribers.""I like that they keep getting up after getting just knocked to the ground. They keep fighting and they keep trying. They had the crap kicked out of them for a brief period of time. They stopped growing subscribers, and they took a look in the mirror and they said, 'What can we change?'""""There's opportunity there for profitability because they're cutting their spending,"" he added.

Should borrowing costs rise sharply, this dynamic would kill expansionary initiatives. Naturally, such a circumstance wouldn’t bode well for growth-oriented enterprises.However, some companies in this category command relevant fundamental narratives. Just as importantly, they receive support from Wall Street analysts. While it’s never smart to exclusively depend on one source for information, here’s the reality: these folks assess various market opportunities for a living. More often than not, they should be right. With that in mind, all of the below long-term growth stocks feature strong double-digit percentage return potential. If you have the patience, here are some compelling ideas to consider.PSXPhillips 66$106.02ELVElevance Health$470.24CCJCameco$28.31MCSMarcus$16.00GMGeneral Motors$41.01ENPHEnphase Energy$217.16BTIBritish American$38.04InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPhillips 66 (PSX)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) engages in refining, transporting, and marketing natural gas liquids and petrochemicals. Though the political framework seemingly exclusively supports green energy initiatives, the reality is that hydrocarbons will be with us for a long time. Scientifically, few other energy sources command the energy density that fossil fuels do.Moreover, it’s not just the narrative that makes PSX one of the long-term growth stocks to buy. Objectively, the market prices PSX at a trailing multiple of 4.67. As a discount to earnings, Phillips 66 ranks better than 70.64% of the competition. Also, PSX trades at a trailing sales multiple of 0.29. This sits well below the sector median value of 1.02 times. Notably, PSX represents a strong performer in the charts. Since the January opener, it gained over 6% of equity value. And in the trailing year, it gained over 27%.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $127.11, implying over 18% upside potential.Elevance Health (ELV)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA health insurance provider, Elevance Health (NYSE:ELV) offers services for various sectors and applications. These include medical, pharmaceutical, dental, behavioral health, long-term care, and disability plans. Given the shock to the system that the coronavirus pandemic sparked, people arguably have a more appreciative perspective of the insurance industry.Presently, Elevance features a market capitalization of $111.53 billion. Since the start of the year, ELV gave up nearly 7% of its equity value. However, in the trailing year, it’s in positive territory, moving up a bit over 1%. Financially, Elevance offers an overall solid profile. For bargain hunters, ELV features a price-earnings-growth ratio of 1.29 times. In contrast, the sector median value is 1.6 times. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 17.2%, above nearly 69% of the industry.Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg ELV as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $577.44, implying over 23% upside potential. Thus, it makes for an intriguing example of long-term growth stocks to buy.Cameco (CCJ)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comCarrying the world’s largest publicly traded uranium company, Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) features a controversial but misunderstood reputation. Obviously, fears of nuclear meltdowns resonate among the public. However, scientific realities force people to examine the upside narrative of CCJ. Simply, nuclear fuel commands astounding energy density.Basically, one uranium fuel pellet carries as much energy potential as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Or, if you want to look at it another way, it’s the equivalent of either 149 gallons of crude oil or one ton of coal. Since nothing else comes close, CCJ easily represents one of the long-term growth stocks to buy.To be fair, though, Cameco will require an extra serving of patience. Primarily, shares feature an overvalued profile. However, the company enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet so don’t overlook it just yet. Plus, Wall Street analysts love CCJ, pegging it a unanimous strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $35.91, implying nearly 29% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the long-term growth stocks to buy.Marcus (MCS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7If you know the name Marcus (NYSE:MCS), it’s probably because you’re familiar with its properties. Otherwise, it tends to slip under the radar. Nevertheless, as migration patterns in the U.S. evolve, MCS could be a massive opportunity among long-term growth stocks to buy.Fundamentally, Marcus features two business units: hotels and resorts and movie theaters. In my opinion, the latter presents significant upside potential. Located in smaller towns and regions, Marcus Theatres may benefit from millennials moving from pricey metropolitan areas to the suburbs. If so, Marcus might clean up.Currently, the market prices MCS at a trailing sales multiple of 0.84. As a discount to revenue, Marcus ranks better than 63.49% of the competition. Also, MCS trades at 1.1 times its book value. In contrast, the sector median stands at 1.57 times. So far, two analysts cover MCS, both rating it a buy. As well, their average price target pings at $22, implying nearly 38% upside potential. Therefore, it’s a quiet but powerful example of long-term growth stocks to buy.General Motors (GM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn American icon, General Motors (NYSE:GM) in some ways has come full circle. Obviously, the automaker suffered an ignominious bankruptcy following the Great Recession. When the Covid-19 crisis hit, looked poised to repeat the ugliness. However, sentiment stormed back, making it a top idea. Moving forward, GM ranks among the best long-term growth stocks to buy.Fundamentally, it’s firing on all cylinders. Most notably, GM made strong investments in the electric vehicle space. Further, by electrifying marquee models such as the Hummer, GM can feed nostalgia with current-generation technologies. However, as its latest-gen Corvette proves, the company refuses to slight its gearhead fanbase. For that, I must give GM some props.Further, the automaker represents an attractive proposition for bargain hunters. Right now, the market prices GM at a forward multiple of 6.39. As a discount to earnings, General Motors ranks better than 84.18% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg GM as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $53.45, implying 38% upside potential.Enphase Energy (ENPH)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAn energy technology firm, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) develops and manufactures solar micro-inverters, battery energy storage, and EV charging stations primarily for residential customers. Fundamentally, rising utility bills and climate change should bolster ENPH as one of the long-term growth stocks to buy.With the events of the new normal disrupting the supply chain of critical resources, this dynamic negatively impacts the broader energy space. In turn, prices rise, leading residential unit owners to consider solar power. In addition, warmer temperatures have sparked blackouts across the nation. Here too, Enphase can help with its battery storage systems. Although shares have accelerated significantly – gaining nearly 30% in the trailing year – Enphase presents an enticing opportunity right now. In particular, its operational stats are simply bonkers.Even better, Wall Street analysts still believe ENPH has more to run, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $303.94, implying nearly 43% upside potential.British American Tobacco (BTI)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comFor the last idea for long-term growth stocks to buy, I’m going to go a bit controversial and seemingly nonsensical. Almost certainly, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, even under the context of willful adult liberties. However, BTI’s relevance or lack thereof might bother investors the most. After all, global smoking prevalence declined over the years.Moreover, it’s not just an isolated statistic. Other research papers indicate that global tobacco use declined. Under virtually all circumstances, this framework should bode poorly for BTI. However, rising stress levels from economic and geopolitical headwinds may see smoking rates increase. Further, big tobacco firms invested heavily in vaporizers or e-cigarettes. This too should help boost BTI stock.For those that want to take the risk, British American offers a discount. Right now, the market prices BTI at a forward multiple of 8.1. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 75% of its peers. Finally, two analysts cover BTI, both pegging it a buy. Their average price target stands at $57.34, implying over 51% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Amgen What Is Amgen's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2022 Amgen had US$38.9b of debt, an increase on US$33.3b, over one year. However, it does have US$9.31b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$29.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Amgen's LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Amgen had liabilities of US$15.7b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$45.8b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$9.31b and US$6.39b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$45.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amgen has a huge market capitalization of US$122.1b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Amgen's net debt of 2.2 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the alluring interest cover (EBIT of 7.2 times interest expense) certainly does not do anything to dispel this impression. We saw Amgen grow its EBIT by 7.8% in the last twelve months. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amgen's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, Amgen generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 94% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewThe good news is that Amgen's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And its interest cover is good too. All these things considered, it appears that Amgen can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Amgen   you should know about.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment.

In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development.

We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products.

Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group The CalculationAs Public Service Enterprise Group operates in the integrated utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%. Relative to the current share price of US$58.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.4 / (6.8% – 2.1%)= US$51.5dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Public Service Enterprise Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Public Service Enterprise GroupStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

(NYSE:M) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Macy's investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.17 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.63 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Macy's has a trailing yield of approximately 3.0% on its current stock price of $21.04. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Macy's If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Macy's is paying out just 15% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (54%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's positive to see that Macy's's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. So we're not too excited that Macy's's earnings are down 3.3% a year over the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Macy's has seen its dividend decline 2.4% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's never nice to see earnings and dividends falling, but at least management has cut the dividend rather than potentially risk the company's health in an attempt to maintain it.To Sum It UpHas Macy's got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have fallen significantly, although at least Macy's paid out less than half of its profits and free cash flow over the last year, leaving some margin of safety. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Macy's from a dividend perspective.If you're not too concerned about Macy's's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. Be aware that Macy's is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is significant...A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Australia's Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. slumped 6.8% on the news and has fallen further since.It hasn't helped the price of rare earths either, accentuating a sharp slide that began in February.Permanent magnets, using rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium, or the more manageable NdPr for short, have become standard in the EV sector.But Tesla and its peers are struggling with the supply-chain dominance of China, the world's largest producer and processor, and a history of extreme price volatility, most recently at the start of 2022.All would like to engineer rare earths out of their electric motors but it's a slow, evolving process as the industry experiments with new configurations.Tesla's announcement is significant for what it says about the direction of travel but won't make much of a dent in a market that is struggling to generate enough supply to meet surging demand.BACK TO THE FUTURETesla has been here before.The EV pioneer used an induction motor rather than a permanent magnet (PM) motor in its original Model S and X iterations but switched with the release of the Model 3 in 2017, according to the IDTechEx research consultancy.It's going to stick with a PM motor but redesign it to exclude rare earths. It was coy on the details but is most likely looking at a ferrite-based alternative, IDTechEx said.Rare earths consultancy Adamas Intelligence agrees, noting that ferrite magnets are ""a proven concept"", already used by General Motors in its 2016 Chevy Volt.However, while they can match a neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB)magnet across one or more parameters, ""this performance comes with a significant weight or efficiency penalty that has historically made the switch unattractive,"" it warned.Story continuesWhich is not going to stop Tesla and others experimenting with alternatives.Audi and Mercedes are opting for an induction motor in their EV series, while BMW and Renault have adopted a wound motor configuration, according to IDTechEx.But the sector still remains heavily reliant on rare earths and permanent magnets, which accounted for 80% of the EV market last year, it said.ACCELERATING DEMANDThe EV revolution is accelerating as both Europe and the United States pour money into decarbonisation, which means the sector is going to remain a key driver of rare earths demand.But electric vehicles are far from being the only user of permanent magnets. They are ubiquitous, powering everything from hard drives to smart phones to wind turbines, another sector that is experiencing heavy government-led investment.Even if Tesla can deliver on its rare-earths-free ambitions, the impact on NdFeB magnet demand is going to be limited, according to Adamas.It estimates that EV motors represent around 12% of global magnet consumption with Tesla accounting for 15-20% of the sector's demand.""The global NdFeB market stands to lose a mere 2% to 3% of demand in the near-term, and maximum 3% to 4% over the long-term assuming Tesla maintains its EV market leadership,"" Adamas estimates.The consultancy has forecast demand for rare earths such as NdPr, terbium and dysprosium to grow at a compound annual rate of 8.6% through 2035, outpacing supply growth of 5.4%. (""Rare Earth Magnet Market Outlook"", April 2022)The outlook is one of deepening supply deficits, that for NdPr oxides is forecast to be 68,000 tonnes by 2035, equivalent to China's production in 2021.This is part and parcel of the broader EV metals narrative with lithium, nickel and copper all in danger of falling short of green demand growth.The common outcome is volatile and elevated pricing.RARE EARTHS ROLLER-COASTERRare earths have been on a price roller-coaster over the last three years.Neodymium, for example, rocketed up from 203,000 yuan per tonne in July 2021 to over 1.5 million yuan in early 2022 amid an acute supply squeeze caused in part by COVID interruptions to raw material flows from Myanmar to China.It has since slumped back to a current 815,000 yuan, according to Chinese data provider Shanghai Metal Market.That, however, is still a lot higher than it was a couple of years ago, attesting to the strength of underlying demand in a year when the consumer electronics sector struggled in both the West and China.Pricing remains beholden to China, which is not only the world's largest producer of rare earths but also the largest user, making most of the world's permanent magnets.It's an opaque market with supply determined by government production quotas and internal dynamics characterised by frequent mismatches with demand.There is also the lingering threat that China could weaponise its rare earths supply if relations with the West deteriorate.It did so in 2010 by cutting off exports to Japan in a dispute over the status of the islands in the East China Sea called Senkaku by the Japanese and Diaoyu by the Chinese.REDUCING DEPENDENCEWestern companies have been trying to reduce their dependence on Chinese rare earths ever since.Tesla, which says it has already cut its rare earth usage by 25%, is part of a much broader attempt to move away from what is a particularly problematic supply chain.Western governments are doing the same. Lynas has just announced a A$200 million ($134 million) investment package from Japan Australia Rare Earths, jointly owned by state-owned Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) and Sojitz Corp.The company already has contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense to build rare earth processing capacity in Texas.Western supply is going to grow thanks to government largesse in both the United States and Europe, which is rushing to catch up in the critical minerals race.For now, though, this is a market that remains dominated by China and characterised by price wildness. That's not going to change with Tesla's drive to eliminate the stuff from its next model.($1 = 6.9693 Chinese yuan termini)The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.(Editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

With these higher prices, producers will be able to extract more fossil fuels so the system can go on as before. They also believe that wind turbines, solar panels and other so-called renewables can be made with these fossil fuels, perhaps extending the life of the system further.The insight people tend to miss is the fact that the world’s economy is a physics-based, self-organizing system. Such economies grow for many years, but ultimately, they collapse. The underlying problem is that the population tends to grow too rapidly relative to the energy supplies necessary to support that population. History shows that such collapses take place over a period of years. The question becomes: What happens to an economy beginning its path toward full collapse?One of the major uses for fossil fuel energy is to add complexity to the system. For example, roads, electricity transmission lines, and long-distance trade are forms of complexity that can be added to the economy using fossil fuels.Figure 1. Chart by author pointing out that energy consumption and complexity are complementary. They operate in different directions. Complexity, itself, requires energy consumption, but its energy consumption is difficult to measure.When energy per capita falls, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the complexity that has been put in place. It becomes too expensive to properly maintain roads, electrical services become increasingly intermittent, and trade is reduced. Long waits for replacement parts become common. These little problems build on one another to become bigger problems. Eventually, major parts of the world’s economy start failing completely.When people forecast ever-rising energy prices, they miss the fact that market fossil fuel prices consider both oil producers and consumers. From the producer’s point of view, the price for oil needs to be high enough that new oil fields can be profitably developed. From the consumer’s point of view, the price of oil needs to be sufficiently low that food and other goods manufactured using oil products are affordable. In practice, oil prices tend to rise and fall, and rise again. On average, they don’t satisfy either the oil producers or the consumers. This dynamic tends to push the economy downward.Story continuesThere are many other changes, as well, as fossil fuel energy per capita falls. Without enough energy products to go around, conflict tends to rise. Economic growth slows and turns to economic contraction, creating huge strains for the financial system. In this post, I will try to explain a few of the issues involved.[1] What is complexity?Complexity is anything that gives structure or organization to the overall economic system. It includes any form of government or laws. The educational system is part of complexity. International trade is part of complexity. The financial system, with its money and debt, is part of complexity. The electrical system, with all its transmission needs, is part of complexity. Roads, railroads, and pipelines are part of complexity. The internet system and cloud storage are part of complexity.Wind turbines and solar panels are only possible because of complexity and the availability of fossil fuels. Storage systems for electricity, food, and fossil fuels are all part of complexity.With all this complexity, plus the energy needed to support the complexity, the economy is structured in a very different way than it would be without fossil fuels. For example, without fossil fuels, a high percentage of workers would make a living by performing subsistence agriculture. Complexity, together with fossil fuels, allows the wide range of occupations that are available today.[2] The big danger, as energy consumption per capita falls, is that the economy will start losing complexity. In fact, there is some evidence that loss of complexity has already begun.In my most recent post, I mentioned that Professor Joseph Tainter, author of the book, The Collapse of Complex Societies, says that when energy supplies are inadequate, the resulting economic system will need to simplify–in other words, lose some of its complexity. In fact, we can see that such loss of complexity started happening as early as the Great Recession in 2008-2009.The world was on a fossil fuel energy consumption per capita plateau between 2007 and 2019. It now seems to be in danger of falling below this level. It fell in 2020, and only partially rebounded in 2021. When it tried to rebound further in 2022, it hit high price limits, reducing demand.Figure 2. Fossil fuel energy consumption per capita based on data of BP’s 2022 Statistical Review of World Energy.There was a big dip in energy consumption per capita in 2008-2009 when the economy encountered the Great Recession. If we compare Figure 2 and Figure 3, we see that the big drop in energy consumption is matched by a big drop in trade as a percentage of GDP. In fact, the drop in trade after the 2008-2009 recession never rebounded to the former level.Figure 3. Trade as a percentage of world GDP, based on data of the World Bank.Another type of loss of complexity involves the drop in the recent number of college students. The number of students was rising rapidly between 1950 and 2010, so the downward trend represents a significant shift.Figure 4. Total number of US full-time and part-time undergraduate college and university students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.The shutdowns of 2020 added further shifts toward less complexity. Broken supply lines became more of a problem. Empty shelves in stores became common, as did long waits for newly ordered appliances and replacement parts for cars. People stopped buying as many fancy clothes. Brick and mortar stores did less well financially. In person conferences became less popular.We know that, in the past, economies that collapsed lost complexity. In some cases, tax revenue fell too low for governments to maintain their programs. Citizens became terribly unhappy with the poor level of government services being provided, and they overthrew the governmental system.The US Department of Energy states that it will be necessary to double or triple the size of the US electric grid to accommodate the proposed level of clean energy, including EVs, by 2050. This is, of course, a kind of complexity. If we are already having difficulty with maintaining complexity, how do we expect to double or triple the size of the US electric grid? The rest of the world would likely need such an upgrade, as well. A huge increase in fossil fuel energy, as well as complexity, would be required.[3] The world’s economy is a physics-based system, called a dissipative structure.Energy products of the right kinds are needed to make goods and services. With shrinking per capita energy, there will likely not be enough goods and services produced to maintain consumption at the level citizens are used to. Without enough goods and services to go around, conflict tends to grow.Instead of growing and experiencing economies of scale, businesses will find that they need to shrink back. This makes it difficult to repay debt with interest, among other things. Governments will likely need to cut back on programs. Some governmental organizations may fail completely.To a significant extent, how these changes happen is related to the maximum power principle, postulated by ecologist Howard T. Odum. Even when some inputs are inadequate, self-organizing ecosystems try to maintain themselves, as best possible, with the reduced supplies. Odum said, “During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency.” As I see the situation, the self-organizing economy tends to favor the parts of the economy that can best handle the energy shortfall that will be taking place.In Sections [4], [5], and [6], we will see that this methodology seems to lead to a situation in which competition leads to different parts of the economy (energy producers and energy consumers) being alternately disadvantaged. This approach leads to a situation in which the human population declines more slowly than in either of the other possible outcomes:Energy producers win, and high energy prices prevail – The real outcome would be that high prices for food and heat for homes would quickly kill off much of the world’s population because of lack of affordability.Energy consumers always win, and low energy prices prevail – The real outcome would be that energy supplies would fall very rapidly because of inadequate prices. Population would fall quickly because of a lack of energy supplies (particularly diesel fuel) needed to maintain food supplies.[4] Prices: Competition between producers and customers will lead to fossil fuel energy prices that alternately rise and fall as extraction limits are hit. In time, this pattern can be expected to lead to falling fossil fuel energy production.Energy prices are set through competition between:[a] The prices that consumers can afford to pay for end products whose costs are indirectly determined by fossil fuel prices. Food, transportation, and home heating costs are especially fossil fuel price sensitive. Poor people are the most quickly affected by rising fossil fuel prices.[b] The prices that producers require to profitably produce these fuels. These prices have been rising rapidly because the easy-to-extract portions were removed earlier. For example, the Wall Street Journal is reporting, “Frackers Increase Spending but See Limited Gains.”If fossil fuel prices rise, the indirect result is inflation in the cost of many goods and services. Consumers become unhappy when inflation affects their lifestyles. They may demand that politicians put price caps in place to somehow stop this inflation. They may encourage politicians to find ways to subsidize costs, so that the higher costs are transferred to a different part of the economy. At the same time, the producers need the high prices, to be able to fund the greater reinvestment necessary to maintain, and even raise, future fossil fuel energy production.The conflict between the high price producers need and the low prices that many consumers can afford is what leads to temporarily spiking energy prices. In fact, food prices tend to spike, too, since food is a kind of energy product for humans, and fossil fuel energy products (oil, especially) are used in growing and transporting the food products. In their book, Secular Cycles, researchers Peter Turchin and Sergey Nefedov report a pattern of spiking prices in their analysis of historical economies that eventually collapsed.With oil prices spiking only temporarily, energy prices are, on average, too low for fossil fuel producers to afford adequate funds for reinvestment. Without adequate funds for reinvestment, production begins to fall. This is especially a problem as fields deplete, and funds needed for reinvestment rise to very high levels.[5] Demand for Discretionary Goods and Services: Indirectly, demand for goods and services, especially in discretionary sectors of the economy, will also tend to get squeezed back by the rounds of inflation caused by spiking energy prices described in Item [4].When customers are faced with higher prices because of spiking inflation rates, they will tend to reduce spending on discretionary items. For example, they will go out to eat less and spend less money at hair salons. They may travel less on vacation. Multiple generation families may move in together to save money. People will continue to buy food and beverages since these are essential.Businesses in discretionary areas of the economy will be affected by this lower demand. They will buy fewer raw materials, including energy products, reducing the overall demand for energy products, and tending to pull energy prices down. These businesses may need to lay off workers and/or default on their debt. Laying off workers may further reduce demand for goods and services, pushing the economy toward recession, debt defaults, and thus lower energy prices.We find that in some historical accounts of collapses, demand ultimately falls to close to zero. For example, see Revelation 18:11-13 regarding the fall of Babylon, and the lack of demand for goods, including the energy product of the day: slaves.[6] Higher Interest Rates: Banks will respond to rounds of inflation described in Item [4] by demanding higher interest rates to offset the loss of buying power and the greater likelihood of default. These higher interest rates will have adverse impacts of their own on the economy.If inflation becomes a problem, banks will want higher interest rates to try to offset the adverse impact of inflation on buying power. These higher interest rates will tend to reduce demand for goods that are often bought with debt, such as homes, cars, and new factories. As a result, the sale prices of these assets are likely to fall. Higher interest rates will tend to produce the same effect for many types of assets, including stocks and bonds. To make matters worse, defaults on loans may also rise, leading to write-offs for the organizations carrying these loans on their balance sheets. For example, the used car dealer Caravan is reported to be near bankruptcy because of issues related to falling used car prices, higher interest rates, and higher default rates on debt.An even more serious problem with higher interest rates is the harm they do to the balance sheets of banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. If bonds were previously purchased at a lower interest rate, the value of the bonds is less at a higher interest rate. Accounting for these organizations can temporarily hide the problem if interest rates quickly revert to the lower level at which they were purchased. The real problem occurs if inflation is persistent, as it seems to be now, or if interest rates keep rising.[7] A second major conflict (after the buyer/producer conflict in Item [4], [5], and [6]) is the conflict in how the output of goods and services should be split between returns to complexity and returns to basic production of necessary goods including food, water, and mineral resources such as fossil fuels, iron, nickel, copper, and lithium.Growing complexity in many forms is something that we have come to value. For example, physicians now earn high wages in the US. People in top management positions in companies often earn very high wages. The top people in large companies that buy food from farmers earn high wages, but farmers producing cattle or growing crops don’t fare nearly as well.As energy supply becomes more constrained, the huge chunks of output taken by those with advanced degrees and high positions within the large companies gets to be increasingly problematic. The high incomes of citizens in major cities contrasts with the low incomes in rural areas. Resentment among people living in rural areas grows when they compare themselves to how well people in urbanized areas are doing. People in rural areas talk about wanting to secede from the US and wanting to form their own country.There are also differences among countries in how well their economies get rewarded for the goods and services they produce. The United States, the EU, and Japan have been able to get better rewards for the complex goods that they produce (such as banking services, high-tech medicine, and high-tech agricultural products) compared to Russia and the oil exporting countries of the Middle East. This is another source of conflict.Comparing countries in terms of per capita GDP on a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis, we find that the countries that focus on complexity have significantly higher PPP GDP per capita than the other areas listed. This creates resentment among countries with lower per-capita PPP GDP.Figure 5. Average Purchasing Power Parity GDP Per Capita in 2021, in current US dollars, based on data from the World Bank.Russia and the Arab World, with all their energy supplies, come out behind. Ukraine does particularly poorly.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is between two countries that are doing poorly on this metric. Ukraine is also much smaller than Russia. It appears that Russia is in a conflict with a competitor that it is likely to be able to defeat, unless NATO members, including the US, can give immense support to Ukraine. As I discuss in the next section, the industrial ability of the US and the EU is waning, making it difficult for such support to be available.[8] As conflict becomes a major issue, which economy is largest and is best able to defend itself becomes more important.Figure 6. Total (not per capita) PPP GDP for the US, EU, and China, based on data of the World Bank.Back in 1990, the EU had a greater PPP GDP than did either the US or China. Now, the US is a little ahead of the EU. More importantly, China has come from way behind both the US and EU, and now is clearly ahead of both in PPP GDP.We often hear that the US is the largest economy, but this is only true if GDP is measured in current US dollars. If differences in actual purchasing power are reflected, China is significantly ahead. China is also far ahead in total electricity production and in many types of industrial output, including cement, steel, and rare earth minerals.The conflict in Ukraine is now leading countries to take sides, with Russia and China on the same side, and the United States together with the EU on Ukraine’s side. While the US has many military bases around the world, its military capabilities have increasingly been stretched thin. The US is a major oil producer, but the mix of oil it produces is of lower and lower average quality, especially if obtaining diesel and jet fuel from it are top priorities.Figure 7. Chart by OPEC, showing the mix of liquids that now make up US production. Even the “Tight crude” tends to be quite “light,” making it less suitable for producing diesel and jet fuel than conventional crude oil. Chart from OPEC’s February 2023 Monthly Oil Market Report.Huge pressure is building now for China and Russia to trade in their own currencies, rather than the US dollar, putting pressure on the US financial system and its status as the reserve currency. It is also not clear whether the US would be able to fight on more than one front in a conventional war. A conflict with Iran has been mentioned as a possibility, as has a conflict with China over Taiwan. It is not at all clear that a conflict between NATO and China-Russia is winnable by the NATO forces, including the US.It appears to me that, to save fuel, more regionalization of trade is necessary with the Asian countries being primary trading partners of each other, rather than the rest of the world. If such a regionalization takes place, the US will be at a disadvantage. It currently depends on supply lines stretching around the world for computers, cell phones, and other high-tech devices. Without these supply lines, the standards of living in the US and the EU would likely decline quickly.[9] Clearly, the narratives that politicians and the news media tell citizens are under pressure. Even if they understand the true situation, politicians need a different narrative to tell voters and young people wondering about what career to pursue.Every politician would like a “happily ever after” story to tell citizens. Fortunately, from the point of view of politicians, there are lots of economists and scientists who put together what I call “overly simple” models of the economy. With these overly simple models of the economy, there is no problem ahead. They believe the standard narrative about oil and other energy prices rising indefinitely, so there is no energy problem. Instead, our only problem is climate change and the need to transition to green energy.The catch is that our ability to scale up green energy is just an illusion, built on the belief that complexity can scale up indefinitely without the use of fossil fuels.We are left with a major problem: Our current complex economy is in danger of degrading remarkably in the next few years, but we have no replacement available. Even before then, we may need to do battle, in new ways, with other countries for the limited resources that are available.By Gail Tverberg   More Top Reads From Oilprice.com: U.S. Oil Drilling Activity Retreats For Second Week In A RowKazakhstan Could Suspend Natural Gas Exports Next WinterCan China Really Be An Unbiased Broker Of Peace? Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.NRG Energy in FocusHeadquartered in Houston, NRG Energy (NRG) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 5.72% so far this year. The power company is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.49% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.25% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.6%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. In the past five-year period, NRG Energy has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 101.82%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 56%. This means it paid out 56% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NRG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.73 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 80.53%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity.

It has auctioned leases in federal waters. But most of the interest in those leases has so far come from European companies with years of experience in the offshore wind sector, which took off in Europe decades ago.Ketchum said some of the industry's complications included salt water corrosion, the threat of hurricanes, the availability of ships and the installation of subsea transmission cables, and added that supply chain issues have driven up the costs.""We find it hard enough just to take care of a fleet onshore with some of the issues that we deal with as a company, and we're best in class,"" he said.Ketchum said NextEra expects its power generation capacity - excluding its regulated utility Florida Power and Light - to grow dramatically in the next few years, from around 25 gigawatts now to around 70 gigawatts in 2026.""And that installed capacity is going to come from renewables only,"" he said.He said the company's plans assume huge advancements in battery storage technology needed to provide power to the grid when the sun is not shining and wind is not blowing. Batteries for power storage currently only last around four hours.""You're going to see significant innovations that come to market for the next, I'd say, five to seven years that are going to dramatically change how we think about batteries,"" he said.Story continuesHe said the electric vehicle industry was driving much of the innovation in batteries.Ketchum said the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which provides some $370 billion in incentives for clean energy, was a significant boost to the industry and that NextEra was well-placed to take advantage of it because of the company's scale.Despite having the largest renewable power fleet, Ketchum believed natural gas would play an important role in generation until storage technology improves.""I mean it's just putting your head in the sand to believe that the energy transition that this country is embarking on will work without natural gas power generation.""

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks.There has been a global energy crisis since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. European countries realized they heavily relied on Russian natural gas and crude oil and needed to transition away from these sources to reduce their dependence. During the conflict, the price of crude oil and natural gas spiked significantly due to global uncertainty, and the importance of oil and gas supply took center stage in the political landscape. As a result, there has been an acceleration in the installation of renewable energy resources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the capacity growth of renewable energy is set to double in the next five years. During this process, renewable energy sources will overtake coal and become the biggest energy source for the generation of electricity.The IEA anticipates the capacity of renewable energy to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) during the 2022 to 2027 period. The increase in the capacity growth of renewable energy is 30% higher than the forecast one year ago. This reflects the positive intent of governments around the world on transforming towards renewable energy sources. The IEA also notes that 90% of the increase in electricity capacity globally will be done through renewable sources, and as a result, renewable energy will become the biggest source of electricity generation by early 2025. IEA Director Fatih Birol shared that in the next five years, the world will add as much renewable energy as in the last two decades.Besides Europe, India, China, and the US are also aggressively pursuing the rollout of renewable energy at various levels. The 14th Five-Year Plan rolled out by China in January 2022 focuses on making China a behemoth in the field of renewable energy, as the country will be responsible for nearly 50% of new capacity additions through renewable energy during the 2022 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 in the US intends to provide long-term support to the aggressive expansion and adoption of renewable energy by various corporations. Meanwhile, India is also set to increase its investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion between 2022 to 2027. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) are some of the most profitable renewable energy stocks in the industry currently.Story continues12 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocksermess/Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyA thorough research was conducted on the renewable energy sector, including its current market trends, growth projections, and key players, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and identify the most promising companies within it. We then shortlisted the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks on the basis of their trailing 12 months’ net income. We have included non-pure play companies in the list as well that have significant exposure to the renewable sector. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their net income.Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks13. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)Trailing 12 months Net Income: $1.91 billionEnbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is a Calgary, Alberta-based pipeline and energy company.The company has invested more than $6 billion (C$8 billion) in renewable energy since its first investment in a wind farm back in 2002. Presently, the company produces 5,192 megawatts (MW) gross of zero-emission energy, which is enough to provide power to 969,000 homes. This makes Enbridge Inc.

(NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”12.

We initiated our position in Tesla in February 2014 at a split-adjusted price of $11.91. Over the subsequent two years, we acquired 16.65 million shares for an average split-adjusted price of $14.22. At the time of our final purchase in February 2016, the stock represented 9.6% of the Fund’s total investments.Tesla produced approximately 35,000 vehicles in 2014, the year of our initial purchase. In 2022, it produced 1.37 million vehicles. Not only has its production grown tremendously, but it has also significantly increased profitability per vehicle.

If you want to read about some more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.While we all might love the idea of investing in risk-free stocks, there's no such thing as a stock that's 100% safe. Even the best companies can face unexpected trouble, and it's common for even the most stable corporations to get shaken up due to significant price volatility. This was evident during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when many strong companies experienced dramatic drops in stock prices. More recently, we saw this phenomenon in 2022 when rising interest rates, inflation, and international conflict shook the stock market.Although 2023 started off on a decent note, the same can't be claimed for the rest of the year if Barclays Capital Inc.'s predictions are anything to go by. The investment advisory firm says that 2023 will go down as one of the worst for the world economy in four decades. Additionally, Ned Davis Research Inc. puts the odds of a severe global downturn at 65%. However, most investment firms agree that the year will be incredibly uneven, with Deutsche Bank AG seeing the S&amp;P 500 Index rising to about 4,500 in the first half, before falling 25% in the third quarter as a downturn bites — only to jump back up to 4,500 by end-2023 as certain investors tailgate a recovery.Long-term investors ignore the agitating, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwinds of uncertainty, they buy the shares of stable companies with reliable performance that’s measured in years, or even decades. Although still subject to volatility like every other stock, these recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In) include household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Story continues10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial StabilityPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of more than 940 hedge funds and picked the top 10 stocks that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The company’s systemwide sales rose 5% on a year-over-year basis, while its global comparable sales rose 10.9% year-over-year in 2022. Although the fast-food chain stated that the currency rate has been fluctuating quite a bit, it sees its FY23 capital expenditures to be around $2.2-$2.4 billion. Additionally, at the end of January, the company revealed plans to open 1900 new restaurants this year globally on a gross basis.On February 17, Loop Capital analyst Alton Stump maintained a Buy rating and $328 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in addition to raising his Q1 growth estimates in the U.S. to 7.5% from 5.5% and FY23 estimates to 4.9% from 4.4%. The analyst cited his latest McDonald's U.S. franchisee checks indicating that same-store sales growth is once again off to a strong start to date in Q1.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 53 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 2 million shares worth $529.3 million.Much like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered a relatively safe bet.9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company offers more than 200 brands—from sodas to waters, from coffees to teas, from juices to kombuchas, and a growing list of flavored alcohol beverages — in more than 200 countries and territories .The beverage giant announced its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares February 15. According to the analyst, the company’s “robust” 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company’s 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 59 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, with 400 million shares.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage. Through its subsidiaries, the company generates clean, emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power units in Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.Earlier this January, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised the price target on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to $110 from $105 on higher assumed NEER capital investment opportunities, influenced by his Generation Outlook 2050 analysis. While he believes that renewables are the key driver of NEER's growth, he adds that other decarbonization-related verticals are emerging. Kalton maintained an Overweight rating on the shares of the company.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was popular among elite funds in Q4 2022, as 61 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.15 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States. On January 5, the retail giant announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022. The company completed more than 6,000 deliveries via drone during the year from its 36 drone delivery hubs across seven states.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $180 from $175 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst raised his estimates on prospects of better sales trends and the likelihood of solid store traffic trends, particularly in January.Evercore ISI added Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to the firm's ""Tactical Outperform"" list on February 17, noting that the stock has lagged the S&amp;P and S&amp;P Retail Index by 5% and 17%, respectively, year-to-date. The firm believes that a 2023 guide down is likely already reflected in the stock performance and sees upside to Q4 results driven by stronger sales and share gains in grocery.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), compared to 68 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q4 2022 increased to $4.85 billion from $4 billion in Q3 2022.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the ""Costco Wholesale"" name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.On February 2, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $568 from $538 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Costco's January sales were ""solid"", and its extreme value proposition will enable the company to continue gaining more members and market share, particularly if the economy continues to soften.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $1.12 billion.Similar to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has historically provided investors with protection against market downturns.Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.  Suggested articles:10 High Growth AI Stocks To Buy11 High Growth IT Stocks to Buy10 Most Promising Blockchain StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

SANTA ANA, Calif., March 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, on International Women's Day, Behr Paint Company announces 'Women in Paint', a program created to highlight the company's commitment to elevating  professional women painters' voices, celebrating their achievements, and inspiring the next generation. In partnership with the Painting Contractors Association (PCA), Behr seeks to help grow the presence of women in a male-dominated industry by spotlighting career-journeys and providing educational opportunities and training resources to women through the PCA's Women in Paint group.Women in Paint""Women comprise only 10% of the building trades workforce nationally1, but this number is on the rise thanks to training programs and diversity and inclusion efforts that encourage more women to enter the skilled trades,"" said Jodi Allen, Global Chief Marketing Officer at Behr Paint Company.

""PCA is proud to partner with Behr on supporting Women in Paint.""To kick off this commitment, Behr worked with the PCA to produce an episode for its 'Business Anatomy' docu-series that highlights four professional women painters' journeys, capturing both their challenges and successes in the industry:Gillian Nielsen, President, Contemporary Surface Solutions, LLC (CSS): After starting her painting career residentially, Gillian became San Diego's first commercial painting forewoman and cultivated an expertise in management, project estimating and executive leadership throughout her 30-plus years in the commercial painting industry.

271,4f2716a3-0be3-3d50-97f5-0e9540d1ad88,MAS,2023-03-09,Masco's (MAS) Long-Term View Looks Good Despite Low Demand,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mascos-mas-long-term-view-144502706.html,1678200302,STORY,"['MAS', 'BLD', 'SSD']","[Masco Corporation MAS has been banking on its market-leading brands, acquisition synergies and cost-saving moves. Notably, its solid long-term growth prospect amid slow housing demand is commendable.However, intense inflationary pressure, supply-chain woes and unfavorable movement in foreign currencies are persistent headwinds.Let’s delve into the influencing factors of this building products manufacturer.Growth Driving FactorsLeading Brand Portfolio: Masco operates through various divisions with a large number of products. Its popular Behr brand is the number one brand in the do-it-yourself (DIY) market for architectural coatings. The PRO paint business within the Decorative Architectural segment continues to gain a significant share in the market. PRO, which accounts for one-third of its paint business, reported sales growth of more than 25% in 2022.Impressively, PRO paint has a three-year run rate of approximately 70%. Recently, Masco launched adjacent paint categories like aerosols, interior stains and caulks and sealants within PRO that are expected to add benefits in 2023. Delta also continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.Solid Long-Term Growth Potential: Masco expects solid growth in the long run. Masco expects to generate 3-5% average annual sales growth organically. The acquisitions are likely to contribute 1-3% yearly to sales. It anticipates approximately 10% average annual EPS growth, backed by a strong operating margin, expansion through cost productivity and volume leverage.This apart, it plans to return shareholders 1-2% above EPS growth via dividends and 2-4% through repurchases. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for long-term EPS growth is currently pegged at 4.9%.Cost-Saving Moves: Masco mainly focuses on business consolidations, system implementations, plant closures, branch closures, improvements in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to improve profitability. These initiatives target company-wide annual savings by reducing corporate expenses and simplifying its organizational structure. Selling, general and administrative expenses — as a percentage of net sales — declined 90 bps in 2022, backed by operating leverage and continued cost discipline across the businesses.Buyout Synergies: Masco believes in expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. In third-quarter 2021, the company’s Delta brand acquired a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products, namely Steamist, Inc. This complements Masco’s strong trade and e-commerce product offerings.Masco regularly divests its less profitable and underperforming businesses to focus on its core areas to accelerate growth and improve shareholder value. On May 31, 2021, it completed the divestiture of the Huppe GmbH business, a manufacturer of shower enclosures and shower trays, from the Plumbing Products segment.Story continuesMajor ConcernsLackluster View: Masco has been witnessing slowness in demand for many of its products since the second quarter of 2022, thanks to higher interest rates, inflation and tighter consumer spending. Given moderating housing demand and foreign currency headwinds, Masco provided lackluster guidance for 2023. It expects sales to decline by approximately 10%.The Plumbing segment’s sales are likely to decline in the range of 10-14%, including the impact of foreign currency. The Decorative Architectural segment’s sales are expected to fall within the range of 5-10%. Particularly within paint, DIY sales are likely to decrease in high-single-digits and PRO sales are expected to decline in mid-single-digits.Due to lower sales volume and higher operational costs, it anticipates adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15%, down from the 2022 level of 15.6%. Of this, the adjusted operating margin for Plumbing is expected to be approximately 16%, almost in line with the 2022 level of 15.9%. Lower volumes and higher operational costs (especially in the first quarter) will likely offset favorable selling price increases. Decorative Architectural adjusted operating margin is estimated to be approximately 16%, down 17.7% recorded in 2022 thanks to high inflation.The company expects 2023 adjusted earnings to be within $3.10-$3.40 per share, down from $3.77 reported in 2022. Earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down to $3.29 per share from $3.46 in the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ concern over the company’s growth potential.High Costs: Masco and Other Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry players like TopBuild Corp. BLD, Installed Building Products, Inc. IBP and Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. SSD have been witnessing intense inflationary pressure over the last few quarters. Owing to supply chain constraints and higher commodity and freight costs, MAS’ 2022 adjusted gross and operating margins contracted 260 bps and 180 bps from the year-ago period’s levels, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA also fell 6.9% year over year.Apart from raw material costs, the company bears expenses related to new product launches. If Masco cannot offset these costs through price increases or supply-chain initiatives, it may adversely affect profits.Currency Woes: Masco is exposed to risks from unfavorable movement in foreign currencies like the euro, the renminbi, the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Any economic unrest in countries served by Masco, especially North America, Europe and China, will adversely impact the company's export business. In 2022, currency impacts reduced net sales by almost 2% and reduced the operating margin.A Brief Overview of the Other StocksTopBuild: This Daytona Beach, FL-based company is an installer and distributor of insulation and other building products to the U.S. construction industry. The company has been benefiting from increased sales volume, solid contribution from acquisitions and pricing at both businesses, defying the labor- and material-constrained market.TopBuild’s earnings are expected to fall 11.7% in 2023.Installed Building: The company is a leading installer of insulation and complementary building products. It primarily banks on a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities across multiple geographies, products and end markets.Installed Building’s earnings for 2023 are expected to decline 6%.Simpson: The company designs, engineers and manufactures high-quality wood and concrete building construction products designed to make structures safer and more secure and perform at high levels. It has been benefiting from product price increases and key growth initiatives.Simpson’s earnings for 2023 are expected to decrease by 16.8%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 12.76% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.37 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.88%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.6%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.48 is up 4.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.78%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, BK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.83 per share, with earnings expected to increase 5.23% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options.

Several of the plaintiffs are the spouses or children of Tyson workers who died after contracting COVID.A message seeking comment was left for Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson.Meat-packing facilities were early epicenters of the COVID epidemic in the U.S., with employees working closely together on the production line. At least 59,000 meat-packing workers contracted COVID-19 and 269 workers died in 2020, according to a U.S. House report issued in 2021.The lawsuit claims Tyson knew about COVID as early as January 2020, when the virus was spreading through its facilities in China. On March 13 of that year, the lawsuit said, Tyson suspended all business travel and mandated that all non-critical employees at its corporate office work remotely.But at the five Arkansas plants where the plaintiffs or their family members worked, Tyson didn’t provide masks or allow work modifications to allow for social distancing until late April 2020, the lawsuit said. The company also didn’t perform contact tracing or quarantine infected workers, the lawsuit said.The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages.The lawsuit isn’t the first to target Tyson over its COVID protocols.In late February, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition by Tyson to move a case in Iowa to federal court. Tyson argued that federal officials wanted it to keep the company's plants running, citing an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump designating meat processing as essential infrastructure.But a federal appeals court judge ruled last year that Tyson can’t claim it was operating under the direction of the federal government. The case filed by family members of Tyson employees who died of COVID __ has been sent back to Iowa state court.]"

Australia's Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. slumped 6.8% on the news and has fallen further since.It hasn't helped the price of rare earths either, accentuating a sharp slide that began in February.Permanent magnets, using rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium, or the more manageable NdPr for short, have become standard in the EV sector.But Tesla and its peers are struggling with the supply-chain dominance of China, the world's largest producer and processor, and a history of extreme price volatility, most recently at the start of 2022.All would like to engineer rare earths out of their electric motors but it's a slow, evolving process as the industry experiments with new configurations.Tesla's announcement is significant for what it says about the direction of travel but won't make much of a dent in a market that is struggling to generate enough supply to meet surging demand.BACK TO THE FUTURETesla has been here before.The EV pioneer used an induction motor rather than a permanent magnet (PM) motor in its original Model S and X iterations but switched with the release of the Model 3 in 2017, according to the IDTechEx research consultancy.It's going to stick with a PM motor but redesign it to exclude rare earths. It was coy on the details but is most likely looking at a ferrite-based alternative, IDTechEx said.Rare earths consultancy Adamas Intelligence agrees, noting that ferrite magnets are ""a proven concept"", already used by General Motors in its 2016 Chevy Volt.However, while they can match a neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB)magnet across one or more parameters, ""this performance comes with a significant weight or efficiency penalty that has historically made the switch unattractive,"" it warned.Story continuesWhich is not going to stop Tesla and others experimenting with alternatives.Audi and Mercedes are opting for an induction motor in their EV series, while BMW and Renault have adopted a wound motor configuration, according to IDTechEx.But the sector still remains heavily reliant on rare earths and permanent magnets, which accounted for 80% of the EV market last year, it said.ACCELERATING DEMANDThe EV revolution is accelerating as both Europe and the United States pour money into decarbonisation, which means the sector is going to remain a key driver of rare earths demand.But electric vehicles are far from being the only user of permanent magnets. They are ubiquitous, powering everything from hard drives to smart phones to wind turbines, another sector that is experiencing heavy government-led investment.Even if Tesla can deliver on its rare-earths-free ambitions, the impact on NdFeB magnet demand is going to be limited, according to Adamas.It estimates that EV motors represent around 12% of global magnet consumption with Tesla accounting for 15-20% of the sector's demand.""The global NdFeB market stands to lose a mere 2% to 3% of demand in the near-term, and maximum 3% to 4% over the long-term assuming Tesla maintains its EV market leadership,"" Adamas estimates.The consultancy has forecast demand for rare earths such as NdPr, terbium and dysprosium to grow at a compound annual rate of 8.6% through 2035, outpacing supply growth of 5.4%. (""Rare Earth Magnet Market Outlook"", April 2022)The outlook is one of deepening supply deficits, that for NdPr oxides is forecast to be 68,000 tonnes by 2035, equivalent to China's production in 2021.This is part and parcel of the broader EV metals narrative with lithium, nickel and copper all in danger of falling short of green demand growth.The common outcome is volatile and elevated pricing.RARE EARTHS ROLLER-COASTERRare earths have been on a price roller-coaster over the last three years.Neodymium, for example, rocketed up from 203,000 yuan per tonne in July 2021 to over 1.5 million yuan in early 2022 amid an acute supply squeeze caused in part by COVID interruptions to raw material flows from Myanmar to China.It has since slumped back to a current 815,000 yuan, according to Chinese data provider Shanghai Metal Market.That, however, is still a lot higher than it was a couple of years ago, attesting to the strength of underlying demand in a year when the consumer electronics sector struggled in both the West and China.Pricing remains beholden to China, which is not only the world's largest producer of rare earths but also the largest user, making most of the world's permanent magnets.It's an opaque market with supply determined by government production quotas and internal dynamics characterised by frequent mismatches with demand.There is also the lingering threat that China could weaponise its rare earths supply if relations with the West deteriorate.It did so in 2010 by cutting off exports to Japan in a dispute over the status of the islands in the East China Sea called Senkaku by the Japanese and Diaoyu by the Chinese.REDUCING DEPENDENCEWestern companies have been trying to reduce their dependence on Chinese rare earths ever since.Tesla, which says it has already cut its rare earth usage by 25%, is part of a much broader attempt to move away from what is a particularly problematic supply chain.Western governments are doing the same. Lynas has just announced a A$200 million ($134 million) investment package from Japan Australia Rare Earths, jointly owned by state-owned Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) and Sojitz Corp.The company already has contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense to build rare earth processing capacity in Texas.Western supply is going to grow thanks to government largesse in both the United States and Europe, which is rushing to catch up in the critical minerals race.For now, though, this is a market that remains dominated by China and characterised by price wildness. That's not going to change with Tesla's drive to eliminate the stuff from its next model.($1 = 6.9693 Chinese yuan termini)The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.(Editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

(AMEX:GSAT) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 7, 2023Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Globalstar Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jay Monroe, Executive Chairman.Jay Monroe: Thanks for joining Globalstar's fourth quarter and full year 2022 investor call. Please note that today's call contains forward-looking statements intended to fall within the Safe Harbor provided under the securities laws. Factors that could cause the results to differ materially are described in the forward-looking statements and risk factors section of the Globalstar's SEC filings, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the financial year ended 2022 and in last week's earnings release. It's been some time since our last earnings call, and we're pleased to be back at it. We have been busy developing, executing, announcing a long list of critical developments in the interim involving our spectrum, wholesale services, powerful, long-term partnerships and so much more.We also provided a full update and presentation during our Investor Day in November and plan to host similar events when the time is right. On this call and on future earnings calls, we plan to keep our prepared remarks comparatively brief, hitting the highlights for the prior periods and moving directly to Q&amp;A. Today, Dave Kagan, Rebecca Clary, Kyle Pickens and Tim Taylor will be available to answer your questions. As has been our policy even before September 17th -- 7th announcement, we will not be able to answer questions about our wholesale business partner or any of their future services. Instead, we will focus on the other aspects of our business. But what we can say is that the September announcement is the foundation of the company's wholesale satellite plan.We will continue to execute our own satellite opportunities, utilizing our retained capacity, including finalizing the work at 3GPP for our new NTN band class, which we expect to finish this September. Standardization with NTN allows for the proliferation of chipsets and devices able to operate on both satellite and terrestrial networks, greatly increasing the total addressable market for satellite connectivity. We will do this while maintaining the unique satellite assets which we operate today through fully licensed and protected spectrum in the L, S and C bands. This wholesale business strategy allows Globalstar to generate contracted, consistent cash flow for the future, which will grow materially as new satellite assets are deployed in the coming years.Story continuesWe are close to announcing a new and exciting partnership to help utilize our available satellite capacity. On top of our wholesale effort, our core MSS business generates annual revenue in excess of $100 million and is anchored by the legacy SPOT and Duplex businesses. As we had expected and as we have experienced, the major growth driver for our MSS core business is Commercial IoT, which will soon benefit from the introduction of our very first 2-way IoT product launching later this year. We continue to believe in this significant growth opportunity and have appropriately added to the team to help close sales. Our terrestrial spectrum assets have continued to develop well with two major announcements in just the last week. First, the successful completion of terrestrial authority for Band 53 in Spain, our first in Europe, which should foreshadow many more licenses there.Satellite, communicationPhoto by Timon Reinhard on UnsplashSpain represents the 11th national authorization across 4 continents. Secondly, yesterday, we announced our new collaboration with Qualcomm. As additional national authorizations are secured, we view this as an increasingly borderless spectrum resource. The strategic agreement with Qualcomm introduces Band 53 into the full Qualcomm RF ecosystem and sales network, including both the chipset and the front end. This is important for rapid adoption of the small cell infrastructure for private wireless 5G networks. Qualcomm calls this the FSM platform, and its availability will substantially increase the number of radio vendors rolling out Band 53. The FSM is expected to be introduced this summer. Qualcomm will also encourage the use of Band 53 via their global mobile chipset business, the world's largest, so that the widest range of new smartphones, laptops and other 5G devices will be enabled with Band 53 and offered globally.The agreement with Qualcomm further positions Globalstar to monetize our spectrum across multiple commercial channels. Partners will be able to access these products through a rapidly expanding ecosystem with Globalstar and Qualcomm jointly working through Qualcomm's global network of system integrators, or SIs, to offer Qualcomm's suite of solutions for Band 53. Together with these SIs, Globalstar can deploy spectrum in support of new 5G network solutions in the U.S. and in any other country where we have or obtained terrestrial authority. This announcement represents a continuation of the company's effort to expand Band 53 ecosystem following the initial agreement with Qualcomm to support us in their prior Snapdragon modems. We are in negotiations with terrestrial users representing hundreds of millions of dollars of annual spectrum leases for Band 53.On the financing front, we are pleased to sign the agreements we did last week, which were announced in the 8-K, and this was accomplished without dilution. And we are currently working to complete the conditions precedent, including the refinancing of the remaining first-lien facility in the very near future. With an improved capital structure and accelerating cash flow, Globalstar shareholders are well positioned to realize the value of the opportunities at hand. Concluding my remarks today, 2022 represented a significant improvement in the company's financial results, including revenue increasing 19% and adjusted EBITDA increasing 48%. The Commercial IoT growth is accelerating, and we believe this growth will accelerate again with the introduction of our 2-way module later this year.Entering the 2-way market will close the gap versus competitive alternatives and allows us to attack a large existing market with an established OEM distribution channel. This is a massive opportunity for Globalstar, and we will continue evolving our IoT products and service offerings as IoT connectivity becomes more and more critical across industrial use cases. We will now open up the call to Q&amp;A, including the availability of Dave, Rebecca, Kyle and Tim. Please direct questions to whomever you prefer. We remind you that we are not able to answer questions related to our activities in the direct handset market. And we thank you in advance for focusing your questions on the other part of our business and our financial results.See also 15 Largest Commercial Printing Companies in the World and 12 High Growth Forever Dividend Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$133b last week after a 3.6% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 22% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell QUALCOMM which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of QUALCOMM. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.QUALCOMM already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see QUALCOMM's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.2% by the third-largest shareholder.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that QUALCOMM Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$166m worth of shares.

Welcome to the Globalstar Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jay Monroe, Executive Chairman.James MonroeThanks for joining Globalstar's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Investor Call. Please note that today's call contains forward-looking statements intended to fall within the safe harbor provided under the securities laws. Factors that could cause the results to differ materially are described in the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the Globalstar's SEC filings, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the financial year ended 2022 and in last week's earnings release.It's been some time since our last earnings call, and we're pleased to be back at it. We have been busy developing, executing, announcing a long list of critical developments in the interim involving our spectrum, wholesale services, powerful, long-term partnerships and so much more. We also provided a full update and presentation during our Investor Day in November and plan to host similar events when the time is right. On this call and on future earnings calls, we plan to keep our prepared remarks comparatively brief, hitting the highlights for the prior periods and moving directly to Q&amp;A, when today, Dave Kagan, Rebecca Clary, Kyle Pickens and Tim Taylor will be available to answer your questions. As has been our policy even before September 17 -- 7 announcement, we will not be able to answer questions about our wholesale business partner or any of their future services. Instead, we will focus on the other aspects of our business. But what we can say is that the September announcement is the foundation of the company's wholesale satellite plan. We will continue to execute our own satellite opportunities, utilizing our retained capacity, including finalizing the work at 3GPP for our new MTN band class, which we expect to finish this September. Standardization with MTN allows for the proliferation of chipsets and devices able to operate on both satellite and terrestrial networks, greatly increasing the total addressable market for satellite connectivity. We will do this while maintaining the unique satellite assets which we operate today through fully licensed and protected spectrum in the L-S and C bands. This wholesale business strategy allows Globalstar to generate contracted, consistent cash flow for the future, which will grow materially as new satellite assets are deployed in the coming years. We are close to announcing a new and exciting partnership to help utilize our available satellite capacity. On top of our wholesale effort, our core MSS business generates annual revenue in excess of $100 million and is anchored by the legacy SPOT and Duplex businesses. As we had expected and as we have experienced, the major growth driver for our MSS core business is Commercial IoT, which will soon benefit from the introduction of our very first 2-way IoT product launching later this year. We continue to believe in this significant growth opportunity and have appropriately added to the team to help close sales. Our terrestrial spectrum assets have continued to develop well with 2 major announcements in just the last week. First, the successful completion of terrestrial authority for Band 53 in Spain, our first in Europe, which should foreshadow many more licenses there. Spain represents the 11th national authorization across 4 continents. Secondly, yesterday, we announced our new collaboration with Qualcomm. As additional national authorizations are secured, we view this as an increasingly borderless spectrum resource. The strategic agreement with Qualcomm introduces Band 53 into the full Qualcomm RF ecosystem and sales network, including both the chipset and the front end. This is important for rapid adoption of the small cell infrastructure for private wireless 5G networks. Qualcomm calls this the FSM Platform, and its availability will substantially increase the number of radio vendors rolling out Band 53. The FSM is expected to be introduced this summer. Qualcomm will also encourage the use of Band 53 via their global mobile chipset business, the world's largest, so that the widest range of new smartphones, laptops and other 5G devices will be enabled with Band 53 and offered globally. The agreement with Qualcomm further positions Globalstar to monetize our spectrum across multiple commercial channels. Partners will be able to access these products through a rapidly expanding ecosystem with Globalstar and Qualcomm jointly working through Qualcomm's global network of system integrators, or SIs, to offer Qualcomm's suite of solutions for Band 53. Together with these SIs, Globalstar can deploy spectrum in support of new 5G network solutions in the U.S. and in any other country where we have or obtained terrestrial authority. This announcement represents a continuation of the company's effort to expand Band 53 ecosystem following the initial agreement with Qualcomm to support us in their prior Snapdragon modems. We are in negotiations with terrestrial users representing hundreds of millions of dollars of annual spectrum leases for Band 53.On the financing front, we are pleased to sign the agreements we did last week, which were announced in the 8-K, and this was accomplished without dilution. And we are currently working to complete the conditions precedent, including the refinancing of the remaining first-lien facility in the very near future. With an improved capital structure and accelerating cash flow, Globalstar shareholders are well positioned to realize the value of the opportunities at hand. Concluding my remarks today, 2022 represented a significant improvement in the company's financial results, including revenue increasing 19% and adjusted EBITDA increasing 48%. Commercial IoT growth is accelerating, and we believe this growth will accelerate again with the introduction of our 2-way module later this year. Entering the 2-way market will close the gap versus competitive alternatives and allows us to attack a large, existing market with the established OEM distribution channels. This is a massive opportunity for Globalstar, and we will continue evolving our IoT products and service offerings as IoT connectivity becomes more and more critical across industrial use cases. We will now open up the call to Q&amp;A, including the availability of Dave, Rebecca, Kyle and Tim. Please direct questions to whomever you prefer. We remind you that we are not able to answer questions related to our activities in the direct handset market. And we thank you in advance for focusing your questions on the other part of our business and our financial results.Story continuesQuestion and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.Simon William FlanneryI was wondering if you could just talk to your prior 2023 guidance, and any more updates or color you can provide to that? And particularly, any comments around CapEx and comments around free cash flow, to what extent the revenues will be coming out of your deferred revenue balance versus new additional cash inflows?Rebecca S. ClarySure, Simon. It's Rebecca. So our 2023 guidance that we issued in September and reaffirmed, I believe, in our third quarter earnings release in November, we still feel confident about that revenue range of $185 million to $230 million. There's nothing that has changed that would have impacted those projections from the prepay agreement that we signed last week. So CapEx, though, has changed, obviously. So now we're committed to funding about $250 million of the CapEx for the new satellite through primarily operating cash flows. And so that will be funded over the next couple of years. And then on the favorable side, we are saving quite a bit of interest by not having to raise $500 million of senior debt at astronomical rates, as you guys know. So depending on the assumptions, we're saving upwards of $150 million over the construction period. But again, offsetting that from a cash flow perspective, we're spending $250 million more in CapEx. That is a timing issue just in terms of the repayment of that CapEx investment, will come to us over the Phase 2 service period after those satellites are launched. So again, it's an upfront investment and just the timing of cash flow issue.Simon William FlanneryAnd anything on what your revenues -- how you use the deferred revenue balance this year? Is that going to grow this year or decline?Rebecca S. ClarySo the -- we still have to do a little bit of study in the [GAAP] to figure out how the new prepayment will work as far as that, that will be deferred revenue or debt classification on our balance sheet. But regardless, it will turn into revenue when we earn it over the Phase 2 service period. Now the $94 million that we received in prior years that is sitting in deferred revenue, that will be recognized over the service period that started in November.Simon William FlanneryRight. And it's been about a year since you signed the deal with MDA to build a new constellation. Could you update us on the progress on the manufacturing of the satellites? And I think you said before delivery and launch by the end of '25. Is that still looking good?James MonroeYes...Timothy Evan TaylorYes, I'm happy to get that, Simon...David B. KaganGo ahead, Tim.Timothy Evan TaylorSo we've been working on the contract. The 1-year anniversary was a few weeks ago, so we're a little over 12 months into it. And a major milestone in the first year of the construction contract is the completion of PDR, which is the preliminary design review. That happened a few months ago, and that's the initial design leading up then for a period of about 8 months or 9 months until you get to the critical design review. So we're on schedule, on budget and lined up well for launches in 2025.Simon William FlanneryGreat. Good to hear. And then just one last one. The FCC seems to be taking an active interest in the satellite terrestrial intersection. Could you just talk about how you see what's being proposed as a position -- Globalstar's position relative to competitors?James MonroeYes, I can take that. Generally speaking, Simon, there are a number of changes that are going on in the industry right now, and everybody is watching those. And so the FCC will have to address a series of regulatory issues related to that. Obviously, Globalstar is a heavy user of all of its satellite spectrum, especially under our new arrangements. And so it's unlikely that we will have any direct action that I think will be -- that will survive the FCC process if someone wants to mount something to utilize ours. But generically, there are changes that will happen in the industry over the next year or so that the FCC will have to wrestle with, for instance, how will SpaceX and T-Mo deal with their spectrum questions in front of the FCC, and there are a number of those. So we anticipate ongoing discussions that will take place and ongoing regulatory proceedings which, of course, we're extremely cognizant of every single day. And given that we have globally harmonized spectrum, our issues will be, I think, issues that are not settled only within the FCC context, but more our 25-year history of operating on a global basis and, therefore, in front of the ITU for -- in a lot of cases.OperatorOur next question comes from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum Capital.George Frederick SuttonJay, at the Analyst Day -- and by the way, thanks for doing this call. I think it's great. So at the Analyst Day, you had suggested a potential for a significant agreement with a new partner you were hoping by year-end. You reiterated that this morning, I believe. Can you just give us any sort of update on the progress you're making towards this partnership and what we should be expecting?James MonroeGeorge, no doubt, you read one of those -- yes, actually 2 of them in the last week. We're constantly looking to expand our terrestrial footprint. Spain was a very important part of that. And of course, now we'll proceed across the continent with many more of those types of authorization. That's the foundation by which you roll out terrestrial. Then there are other categories of relationships that we are finessing right now and trying to bring to a conclusion. Those include leases for the terrestrial spectrum as well as new business models for our retained satellite capacity. All of those were alluded to in the Investor Day that we had, some of which, those 2 that I mentioned have come to fruition now. But I think we can look forward to more in the near term, which are both terrestrial and satellite.George Frederick SuttonGot you. And perhaps next question is best for Rebecca. But the refinancing of the first-lien facility, can you just give us a sense of how that's being marketed or what the structure we should be expecting from that to be?Rebecca S. ClarySure. So we've been working with Goldman for quite a few months. It's a challenging environment, as you guys know. And so I know it's taken a little bit longer than some of you would like. But as we demonstrated last week, we obviously have the shareholder value as our most fundamental priority and/or if it takes more time to get it done, we're going to take more time to get it done. So they were a few days away from this upcoming deadline, but hopefully have some faith in it. So while we are not prepared to make an announcement right now as far as the [tax] form or size or timing, just know that we're working every day on it, and we've got options at the table that we think that are favorable to the company, and we hope to announce something then.George Frederick SuttonFabulous. And last, Jay, the concept of borderless spectrum is quite unique. What are the best types of use cases that you would suggest?James MonroeSo -- oh, go ahead, Kyle.Kyle PickensYes. George, so look, I think there are a lot -- a number of large multinational companies that have operations in various geographies where we have terrestrial rights. And so the ability through a partnership like we have now with or a strategic collaboration with -- that we have with Qualcomm, we'll be able to go to those types of parties and say, here is a solution that works seamlessly across all of your operations. That's -- I think that will be very attractive to a variety of different industries, including OEMs, large equipment manufacturers, mining companies, transportation, several different industries like that, that we'll be going after. One of the things that we've talked about in the past, I think there's -- I guess to maybe cut off some questions at some point, but we've said that we think that the terrestrial opportunity is several hundred million dollars, many hundreds of millions of dollars a year in potential lease revenue. We think that the Qualcomm agreement that we've announced yesterday really moves us dramatically forward in that effort. I don't even know the last -- the release that we did this. But a while ago, we talked about how this -- the process to get terrestrial spectrum where it's deployable. This agreement and the work that Qualcomm is going to do is really kind of the last step in the development of the ecosystem. And we're very excited to see how, now that we'll soon have completely a solution that we can offer to the world, how fast that starts to grow. I mean I'm starting to think of how do we manage kind of the inflow of opportunities, whereas until today, it's really been how do we get the ecosystem to the point where we can start to do that.OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities.Michael Roy CrawfordJust to continue on that last topic and the earlier statement that you're in negotiations on hundreds of millions of terrestrial spectrum leases. Can you break that out, that opportunity out by geography?Kyle PickensJay, do you want to take that or you want me to?James MonroeNo, go ahead, Kyle.Kyle PickensYes, so it's -- there are a lot of different opportunities that we're in various stages of negotiation in terms of -- I don't want to get too specific on any of them. But to get to the hundreds of millions of dollars, that would definitely implicate the United States, but it also could be global. So there's a variety of different opportunities at various stages. And cumulatively, they add up to quite a large number, but I can't go to specifics right now.Michael Roy CrawfordAnd given your ongoing satellite operations with your Band 53, is this something that really needs to be leased? Or would there be -- are any of these discussions turning towards possible sale of the spectrum? Or could you even do that while you still operate your satellite business?Kyle PickensWell, it's hard for us to sell the spectrum in kind of the traditional sense. There's lots of different ways that leases can be structured, but all of the conversations are around leasing the spectrum.Michael Roy CrawfordSo Anterix likes to qualify its pipeline in terms of 3 stages, kind of early, middle and final stage. Is there any bifurcation of that sort you could do?Kyle PickensYes, it's hard for us to do that at this point. I mean it's -- I feel like often we feel like we're towards the very end of things and then they drag out and then people get disappointed. So there's -- we have a lot -- this -- we're in 11 different countries. We've got a full ecosystem. I think there are a tremendous amount of opportunities ahead of us, but it's -- I don't want to kind of start to get too refined on where we are in the pipeline. Yes.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay. And then just to switch topics. So now that you've finished the preliminary design review of the constellation, can you share any of the characteristics of what kind of power output, throughput capacity capabilities you'll be expecting from the replacement constellation?David B. KaganYes. And unfortunately, Mike, we won't get into too many of the specifics there. We have said that the main point of launching the satellite is for the continuation of service and that we were not ever planning on taking any major technical risk. So beyond that, though, the specs and all details of the satellite's payload and bus, that's not something that we're going to be discussing at this time.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Jason Bernstein with Cantor.Jason BernsteinCongrats on a really transformational year. Just to add one -- a couple of questions actually around the new Qualcomm news. Could you sort of simply -- is there a revenue opportunity through Qualcomm? Are they going to go out and sell the ecosystem and potential revenues come through there? Or people sort of buy the small cell ecosystem and then come to Globalstar to lease the spectrum? I guess maybe that's for Kyle.Kyle PickensYes. So the way that it works, so Qualcomm has been working on a complete solution for private networking for a while now. And they look at this as the ability to have a spectrum resource that goes across borders is very attractive to them, I believe. So the way that it will work, they're doing all of the engineering to make sure that the chipsets work. They'll do all of the interoperability work to make sure devices and the radios work together. And then they're going to go with us, but they have a global -- they're obviously a huge company with global reach. And they'll go to their system integrator partners and say, here is a full solution with spectrum and all the equipment that you would need for whatever private network you're wanting to deploy. And so then those system integrators would work with us on a case-by-case basis to work, to do the licensing agreement and the lease. So the revenue is -- will be coming from other parties, not from Qualcomm. Qualcomm will get revenue from selling equipment, and we'll get lease revenue from the people that they introduce us to.Jason BernsteinGot it. Got it. And one more, if I could. In the 10-K, there's a line on that Germany and larger constellation applications being accepted by the ITU. Is that a separate -- when you say larger satellite constellation than we have today, is that the 17 satellites MDA is working on? Or is that a future constellation that we really haven't delved into yet?David B. KaganWe have no comment on that one at this time.Jason BernsteinGot it. Okay. I look forward to the next call then.OperatorAnd this concludes the Q&amp;A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jay Monroe for any closing remarks.James MonroeThank you all for joining today. We appreciate the attendance from investors, analysts and others, and look forward to doing this again. As always, we are available for follow-up questions. For those who asked questions today and want to go deeper and always, of course, talking to our investors anytime you want to reach out to us. Thank you very much for joining. We look forward to doing it again soon with more important news. Thank you.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

She has had executive and other leadership roles in technology for companies in several sectors, including Verizon Media, Gap Inc., American Express, Ebay, Yahoo, and WebMD.“Honestly, the travel industry as a whole has a lot of legacy technology, and it’s not super easy to move in and adopt some of this. But I do see players like us — players that have core technology in the background, large OTAs — start jumping in to experiment and try things out. And we are right in there.”Expedia Group owns multiple online travel agency and booking brands, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotwire.com, Orbitz, CarRentals.com, and more.Expedia has been investing in AI and other technologies to make these platforms and internal operations more efficient for a while, she said. ChatGPT, the generative AI chatbot made by OpenAI, has shown that it can help users with pre-trip planning, but that’s pretty much the extent so far.“We don’t see generative AI, today, being able to replace this whole gamut of services. Planning a trip is just way more complex than just a bunch of questions,” Murthy said.The real value with generative AI, as experts have said, is not in the chatbot alone but how the technology can be used in the background — overlayed by large swaths of data — to power the future of how these platforms will operate. Though it is unclear exactly how that will look, these platforms will likely be able to make full use of data to personalize interactions in a more comprehensive way, even anticipating users’ needs.“I think there’s potential for us to leverage both of these together to drive transformation. But there’s a lot yet to be done. There’s still a lot of training in the voice and the output that comes from some of the generative AI. There’s a lot of things we are keeping our eye on,” Murthy said.Story continuesThere is a future for the technology — Rob Francis, chief technology officer of online travel agency Booking.com, said he is sure of that. But we’ll have to wait to understand its full potential. While the hype may die down a bit in the meantime, travel companies are investing in the long game.Booking.com is researching internally so that when the company does release generative AI capabilities, the technology is good and ready, Francis said. Singapore-based Trip.com is also doing the research but a bit more publicly, having released a chatbot on the website last month.These booking platforms have already been using AI and machine learning for a while to organize data and aid in personalization. The Expedia platform, for example, processes more than 600 billion AI predictions each year, powered by more than 70 petabytes of data. Experts expect that generative AI will advance that effort a few steps further.Meanwhile, Expedia has been working for the last few years on converging its platforms into a common tech stack in an effort to more easily share data between brands.“We are about 80 percent done with that transformation. So we’re really starting to see the wind and benefits of this huge transformation that we have been on,” Murthy said.Former Orbitz and Uber Exec Joins Car Rental Platform StartupBarney Harford, former chief operations officer of Uber and CEO of Orbitz Worldwide, has joined the board of a next-generation car rental company called Kyte.Through the app, consumers can have cars delivered to them for daily, weekly, or monthly use. A hired driver delivers and picks up the car at the time and location of the customer’s choosing.The startup raised $60 million in Series B growth equity financing last year shortly after getting an asset-backed debt investment of $200 million from Goldman Sachs and Ares.Since then, the company has been working to triple its fleet and expand in new and existing markets globally. The company has access to a few thousand cars in 14 cities.“Kyte’s model of delivering cars to customers when and where they want is an important unlock as society transitions from individual car ownership to transportation as a service,” Harford said in a statement.Holograms at the Front DeskSkift recently interviewed the operations manager of Oslo-based CIC Hospitality about why the company is putting holograms at the front desks of hotels it owns in Scandinavia.

As we focus on our well-being, it can often be difficult to find representation and community in some activities, such as running. According to Running USA's biannual National Runner Survey, only 1.6% of marathon runners in America are African-American, compared with 90% Caucasian, 5.1% Hispanic and 3.9% Asian/Pacific Islander.We interviewed two of our leaders to learn more about their experiences as marathoners, and the ways Expedia Group has empowered them to lead their dream careers and invest in their love for running. One thing they have in common - they both agree running has taken them to new places and expanded their worlds.Kira West, Inclusive Marketing &amp; Social Impact Lead at Expedia Group, is also a wellness entrepreneur with a passion for inclusivity. Kira is the co-founder of ACTIV-ISM, an anti-racism wellness program, and Sanity Miles. She's also a huge lover of traveling and is our Global Vice President of BEAM (Black Expedian Allied Movement, our Black Inclusion Business Group).""Being an athlete is so much more than running marathons and competing in races. An athlete continues to show up and push themselves, reaching new heights while overcoming countless challenges along the way. I'm passionate about running as a vehicle for change.""On finding inspiration to begin running""Midway through college, I wanted to take my wellness more seriously and I wanted to approach it in a holistic way. I had always dreamed of doing a half marathon. In the beginning, a lot of it was overcoming my own challenges. But now, it's become a lot more community-focused and a vehicle for mental wellness. It was also a beautiful way of finding freedom during the pandemic.""For me, my running journey has shown me just how much I'm capable of, not just at the end of that race but in life."" - Kira WestStory continuesOn the relationship between running and work""It has set me up for success and helped me process nuanced concepts. There are a lot of lessons learned in running that translate to work, like making progress. Progress happens over time, for both your success in the workplace and with running. That same concept of consistency is also important in both running and in work.""""Progress happens over time, for both your success in the workplace and with running."" - Kira WestHow Expedia Group has supported employee wellness journeys""I used my wellness and travel benefits to participate in the Berlin marathon.

After our games were finished, there was one person who would always go for a run around the track. One day I asked why he ran, and he inspired me to run with him. I watched this black man do it and that resonated with me. I've been running ever since then.""On the relationship between running and work""I started connecting leadership with running. Leadership is a marathon - it takes the same type of preparation and practice. You have to know where you're going and the outcome want and you need to prepare before you get to the starting line in order to lead. Leadership and marathons require proper perspective - an unwavering understanding of what you are trying to achieve, and how you are pacing yourself. You also begin to recognize in any leadership journey that you can ""hit the wall"" the same way you do with running where your body starts to shut down on you.

The contract involves Foreign Military Sales to Canada and other countries.Importance of AEGISThe Aegis Combat System is the U.S. Navy’s most modern surface combat system. It has been designed as a complete system, most suitable for military missions, and includes the missile launching element, the computer programs, the radar and the displays that are fully integrated to work together.Due to its remarkable features that are well-suited for any military mission, Lockheed Martin continues to witness a steady inflow of orders involving this combat system. The latest contract win is a testament to the same. This, in turn, should bolster LMT’s revenues from the combat system.Growth ProspectsThe Russia-Ukraine warfare has led many nations to increase their defense spending for strengthening their security. With defense arsenals and ammunitions forming an integral part of an efficient combat system, defense products have been witnessing a surge in demand lately. In this context, the demand for an efficient security system, which can strengthen naval sea warfare capabilities, may also increase in the future.Per Mordor Intelligence projections, the global naval combat system market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% over the 2022-2027 period. Such projections further exemplify immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to capitalize on the expanding market with its state-of-the-art combat system.Story continuesSuch abounding growth projections will also benefit prominent defense majors like Raytheon Technologies RTX, BAE Systems BAESY and Elbit Systems ESLT, as these stocks have immense presence in the naval combat space.Raytheon Technologies’ Missiles &amp; Defense unit provides an integrated portfolio of solutions in naval warfare, ranging from sensors to command and control systems to precision weapons.

But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) share price is up 44% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 6.9% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Lockheed Martin managed to grow its earnings per share at 28% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Lockheed Martin, it has a TSR of 64% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Lockheed Martin shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.7% over one year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 10% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the aforementioned contract.Details of the DealValued at $70.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide integrated logistics support in preparing Kuwait pilots for delivery of the Kuwait F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.The aforementioned integrated logistics support includes general logistics support; logistics program management; logistics support to aircraft during pilot training within the continental U.S. (CONUS); and maintenance of aircraft, aircraft armament equipment, F414 engines, and Sniper pods. It also includes logistics representative support within and outside the CONUS ferry support; packaging, handling, storage and transportation; and program security tasks.The deal will serve the government of Kuwait, with majority of the work projected to be executed in New Orleans, LA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT .Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a 4.6% improvement from the 2022 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.9%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.86%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%.

If you read it, you may immediately want to sell any defense stocks you own.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), if the U.S. were to get into a scrap with China over Taiwan, it would run out of long-range, precision-guided munitions in less than a week.That’s not a comforting reality. Nor is it reasonable that the defense industry’s innovation and competitive nature have disappeared.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“The defense sector has moved from more than 70 aerospace and defense ‘prime contractors’ that worked directly with the government in 1980 to just five by the early 2000s, the same number as today: Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Technologies Corp., General Dynamics Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., and Boeing,” Bloomberg’s 20 February article stated.The efforts to keep Ukraine weaponized have revealed a nasty truth about the American military complex: It’s held together with duct tape. Any large-scale global conflict where the U.S. is an actual participant could put the industry in severe distress.As a result, if you own individual defense stocks, here are three reasons you might want to sell your holdings right now.There’s Only So Much Growth AvailableStacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockIn fiscal 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) will account for 17% of the U.S. federal budget. Of the $1.9 trillion allocated to the DOD, approximately $405 billion has been committed and paid out by the federal government, with the remaining $1.5 trillion in the form of contracts, grants, and awards to be paid out at some point in the future.So, as you can see, it’s a fast-moving target that changes by the day. For example, the budgetary resources for the DOD have risen by 52% over the past five years, from $1.25 trillion in fiscal 2019 to $1.90 trillion in 2023.Story continuesAccording to USASpending.gov, the DOD has $100 billion in commitments left from 2019, $150 billion in 2020, $360 billion in 2021,  $450 billion in 2022, and $1.5 trillion in 2023. That’s a total of $2.56 trillion yet to be paid out.Of course, this isn’t all for weapons, but there are still a bunch of commitments to the five companies mentioned in the intro and the other sub-contractors doing work for the prime contractors.While this monopoly seems like a good deal for the five companies, it hinders the speed and efficiency of significant projects.“A 2021 Hudson Institute study argued that the time it takes for the Defense Department to go from identifying a need to awarding a contract has increased from about one year in 1950 to seven years today. For innovative systems, such as the F-35, it can take another 21 years to become operational,” Bloomberg stated.So, while the stability of having long-term contracts in place is a good thing, the combination of the federal government’s perilous finances, with an artificial ceiling put in place by these multi-year contracts, means the five prime contractors can only grow so fast.The Prime Contractors Are All Public CompaniesGold shield; digital shield, defense, protectionSource: anttoniart / ShutterstockThe total market cap of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and Boeing (NYSE:BA) is $527 billion.Together, they generated $78 billion in revenue in 2022, with more than $10 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). That’s a 13.4% EBITDA margin. While that’s good, it can’t compare to 31% for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example.As I wrote in the previous section, there’s an argument to be made that the consolidation of prime contractors (70 in 1980, down to 5 since the 2000s) has severely curtailed competition and innovation in the defense and aerospace industry.Having five prime contractors, all public companies, and all accountable to short-termism, also stifles innovation and research. After all, why spend billions on R&amp;D when you can shower shareholders with dividends and share repurchases?Consider this: Over the past five years, only Lockheed Martin’s stock performed anywhere close to the S&amp;P 500. The index’s five-year cumulative return is 42.88%, 240 basis points higher than LMT. The next highest return was Northrop Grumman, up 33.93%, while the other three averaged -7.62%.So, despite all the talk about how wars are good business, these five companies rarely seem to be leading the markets.This ETF Gives You Defense Exposure and Is a Smarter Betkeyboard featuring etf on enter key. vangaurd etfsSource: ShutterstockLook, I’ve recommended individual defense stocks from time to time. For example, in July 2018, I suggested investors buy LMT stock on the dip. It’s up 60% since, 16 percentage points better than the index over the same period.There’s a time and a place.However, if you’re brilliant, you’ll use ETFs to get your exposure to defense stocks without opening yourself up to long periods of poor performance.The iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (BATS:ITA) invests 51.14% of its $5.7 billion in net assets in the stocks of the five prime contractors. Its performance isn’t that good, which isn’t surprising given over half the portfolio is in the five defense stocks. You might as well buy the five individually.A better alternative is to buy the Fidelity MSCI Industrials ETF (NYSEARCA:FIDU), which tracks the performance of the MSCI USA IMI Industrials Index, a collection of stocks representing the U.S. industrial sector.The five defense stocks in FIDU account for slightly less than 13% of the $728 million in net assets. Its performance is much better than ITA (Morningstar.com gives it a four-star rating), and it only charges a fee of 0.08%, keeping it cheap and cheerful.There are better ways to invest your money. I’d be cautious when it comes to buying defense stocks.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

311,9c998dda-341c-37fa-a9be-2bd2b4e561a2,WEC,2023-03-09,Investors in WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) have made a decent return of 67% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-wec-energy-group-nyse-115917699.html,1678363157,STORY,['WEC'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) share price is up 44% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 4.6% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, WEC Energy Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 3.2% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 8% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, WEC Energy Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 67%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, WEC Energy Group shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 1.6% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 6.2%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - WEC Energy Group has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But other than having benefited from the beverage giant’s rising share price over the decades, Berkshire continues to collect dividends from the investment.And the amount might surprise you.Coca-Cola paid four quarterly dividends totaling $1.76 per share in 2022. Berkshire held 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola in 2022, allowing it to earn $704 million in dividends from the company.The figure caught the attention of Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, who tweeted “Berkshire Hathaway high on Coke.”The best part? With dividend investing, there’s no need to worry about the stock market’s ups and downs. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19.4% in 2022, but investors who held high-quality dividend stocks in their portfolios still got paid.Coca-Cola isn’t the only company that Buffett collects dividends from.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts. Dividend zombies are companies with century-long dividend payouts, whereas dividend kings are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 50 years or more. 2022 was a difficult year from an investing point of view due to high inflation and continuous changes in monetary policies. Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&amp;P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time.Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&amp;P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7.In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some other dividend companies with long dividend growth streaks.In February, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's organic sales.At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $28.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 107 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 27International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), also known as Big Blue, is a New York-based technology company that has operations in over 175 countries.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. PPG Industries, Inc.

(NYSE:PPG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 128 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 60Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational consumer goods company, based in New York.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 132 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 66An American multinational consumer goods company, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks seventh on our list of the stocks with the longest dividend payout record.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.  Suggested articles:15 Best Small Cap Stocks Ready to Explode11 Most Profitable Pot Stocks Now11 High Growth Monthly Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

Several extremely high-quality value stocks have been selling off this year, offering investors an opportunity to buy at a discount.On Tuesday morning, in front of Congress, Jerome Powell stated he believed there may be more rate hikes in the future than the market is pricing in. As we saw last year, when rates rise, growth stocks get hit, and value stocks get bid. Is this year setting up like that again?Procter and Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott Labs, three of the most established corporations in the world, are on sale today. This reflects the fact that investors believe the next 12 months are going to be rosy for the economy. But if they are wrong it could be another bull run in value stocks.Procter and GambleProcter and Gamble, founded in 1837, is a multinational branded consumer packaged goods company. Its products range from cleaning products and detergents to shampoo and cold relief medicine. Most Americans, and some 170 other countries probably have a medicine cabinet filled with Procter and Gamble Products. It has a long history of steady earnings growth and stock appreciation.So far this year PG stock is down -8%, as many investors have rotated out of value into growth. Many investors are hoping for a Fed pivot, and lower interest rates. But that thesis is looking shaky.Procter and Gamble was an outperformer for most of 2022, although it did deal with some volatility giving back much of its gains later in the year. But I would contend that this sell-off is an opportunity to buy shares.Sales growth for the current quarter is expected to be down marginally, -0.3% YoY, with the next quarter expecting a resumption of growth. Furthermore, while the current quarter earnings expectations have been revised lower over the last 90 days it has only been a very small revision while all the other time frames have been revised higher over the same period.Story continuesIf PG were able to eke out a slight beat on sales next quarter, it will very likely cause investors to buy back into the stock. Many of the products PG makes are non-discretionary, so even in the case of an economic slowdown or higher inflation, consumers will continue to purchase PG goods.Procter and Gamble currently trades at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 24x, which is in line with its five-year median of 24x. PG offers a dividend yield of 2.6%. It has raised its dividend an average of 6.5% annually over the last five years.Johnson and JohnsonJohnson and Johnson is a deeply diversified pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer products company that was founded in 1886. JNJ’s brands include Tylenol, Nicorette, and Band-aid among many other notable names. Its pharmaceuticals range from psychological treatments to Covid vaccines, and MedTech does everything from stroke treatment to orthopedics.Johnson and Johnson stock has a long history of earnings growth, dividend growth, and price appreciation, returning an average of 10% annually over the last 30 years. So far this year, JNJ stock has struggled though, down -12.5% YTD.Johnson and Johnson is trading at a very reasonable valuation. At 14x one-year forward earnings it is below its 10-year median of 17x. Over the last 10 years the only time the valuation was lower was during the Covid pandemic low. JNJ offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, which it has raised an average of 6% annually over the last five years.JNJ, like PG, has had slight downgrades in the current quarter earnings expectations, although future timeframes are being upgraded. Additionally current quarter sales are still expecting slight growth, which will accelerate over the next few quarters.Because of the non-discretionary nature of JNJ products, the company should remain very robust though many different economic regimes. So, if investors are looking for some defensive allocations in their portfolio, I think JNJ fits the bill.Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott Laboratories is another company founded in the 1800s, with a long history of earnings growth, dividend growth, and consistent stock appreciation. Over the last 25 years ABT stock has provided an average annual return of 10%. Additionally, management has raised dividends an average of 14% annually over the last 5 years.Abbott Labs discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells health care products worldwide. It operates in four segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Products sold by Abbott are critical in the treatment of many health issues ranging from glucose monitoring for diabetes, to heart pumps for cardiovascular disease treatment.Currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 23x, ABT stock is just below its five-year median of 24x. So far this year ABT stock is down -8.2%, and over the last two years is down -10%. This has all happened while both earnings and sales have increased 45% and 24% respectively over the two-year period.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

It has a long history of steady earnings growth and stock appreciation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo far this year PG stock is down -8%, as many investors have rotated out of value into growth. Many investors are hoping for a Fed pivot, and lower interest rates. But that thesis is looking shaky.Procter and Gamble was an outperformer for most of 2022, although it did deal with some volatility giving back much of its gains later in the year. But I would contend that this sell-off is an opportunity to buy shares.Sales growth for the current quarter is expected to be down marginally, -0.3% YoY, with the next quarter expecting a resumption of growth. Furthermore, while the current quarter earnings expectations have been revised lower over the last 90 days it has only been a very small revision while all the other time frames have been revised higher over the same period.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf PG were able to eek out a slight beat on sales next quarter, it will very likely cause investors to buy back into the stock. Many of the products PG makes are non-discretionary, so even in the case of an economic slowdown or higher inflation, consumers will continue to purchase PG goods.Procter and Gamble currently trades at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 24x, which is in line with its five-year median of 24x. PG offers a dividend yield of 2.6%. It has raised its dividend an average of 6.5% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJohnson and JohnsonJohnson and Johnson is a deeply diversified pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer products company that was founded in 1886. JNJ’s brands include Tylenol, Nicorette, and Band-aid among many other notable names. Its pharmaceuticals range from psychological treatments to Covid vaccines, and MedTech does everything from stroke treatment to orthopedics.Johnson and Johnson stock has a long history of earnings growth, dividend growth, and price appreciation, returning an average of 10% annually over the last 30 years. So far this year, JNJ stock has struggled though, down -12.5% YTD.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJohnson and Johnson is trading at a very reasonable valuation. At 14x one-year forward earnings it is below its 10-year median of 17x. Over the last 10 years the only time the valuation was lower was during the Covid pandemic low. JNJ offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, which it has raised an average of 6% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJNJ, like PG, has had slight downgrades in the current quarter earnings expectations, although future timeframes are being upgraded. Additionally current quarter sales are still expecting slight growth, which will accelerate over the next few years quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBecause of the non-discretionary nature of JNJ products, the company should remain very robust though many different economic regimes. So, if investors are looking for some defensive allocations in their portfolio, I think JNJ fits the bill.Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott Laboratories is another company founded in the 1800s, with a long history of earnings growth, dividend growth, and consistent stock appreciation. Over the last 25 years ABT stock has provided an average annual return of 10%. Additionally, management has raised dividends an average of 14% annually over the last 5 years.Abbott Labs discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells health care products worldwide. It operates in four segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Products sold by Abbott are critical in the treatment of many health issues ranging from glucose monitoring for diabetes, to heart pumps for cardiovascular disease treatment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 23x, ABT stock is just below its five-year median of 24x. So far this year ABT stock is down -8.2%, and over the last two years is down -10%. This has all happened while both earnings and sales have increased 45% and 24% respectively over the two-year period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Mad Money Stock Picks This Week.All indicators show that the Federal Reserve is ready to continue raising interest rates as it has more than enough reasons to stick to its hawkish stance. Bloomberg in a March 5 report said the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates “several more times to quell stubborn inflation.”The Bloomberg report quoted Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who recently talked to reporters and said the following:“I want to be completely clear: There is a case to be made that we need to go higher. Jobs have come in stronger than we expected. Inflation is remaining stubborn at elevated levels. Consumer spending is strong. Labor markets remain quite tight.”The Federal Reserve’s resolve to control inflation and increase rates was more than clear when it recently submitted its semi-annual report to Congress. The Federal Reserve said that it remains “strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.”""Let Them Get Slaughtered in their Bonds""Jim Cramer recently gave his comments on the latest market situation in an episode of his “Mad Money” program on CNBC. Cramer said that the weakness in the market is “all anecdotal” right now. However, Cramer specifically said that those who believe rates are peaking right now are “too bullish.”Cramer further said:“Let them get slaughtered in their bonds.”Cramer said that the market needs to see more soft data showing that the economic activity, wages and inflation are cooling before we get to see a real rally in the stock market.Jim Cramer has time and again reiterated in his latest programs that history is not a guide in the current market environment as he’s been seeing a lot of unprecedented market and consumer behaviors recently. For example, while inflation remains stubborn and we keep reading reports of how the consumer is getting hammered, consistent data shows that the demand in the travel and tourism sector remains strong. Despite inflation, consumers are continuing to spend on hotels and flights. Cramer said that despite rising vacation prices and expensive hotels, people are spending on travel probably because they believe life is too short or what Cramer referred to as the “YOLO (You Only Live Once”) trend. Cramer said the Federal Reserve cannot make sense of these distortions.Story continues""Nothing Makes Sense""Jim Cramer believes there are too many “distortions” in the market right now and “nothing makes sense.” Cramer thinks the “discrepancies” at the moment are “too difficult to fathom.”""Nothing in this economy is working like it’s supposed to. Nothing is predictable, and history is a terrible guide right now because we’ve never been in this situation before.”Despite all of this, people are still interested in knowing what Jim Cramer has to say about US equities and to know which stocks Cramer believes should be piled into. Some notable stocks Jim Cramer has been talking about in his latest programs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Our MethodologyFor this article, we watched several episodes of the Mad Money program of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked the most notable stocks Cramer was recommending in late February and early March.Mad Money Stock Picks This Week10. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40A caller recently asked Jim Cramer about his previous call about Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) and why the stock still hasn’t been able to cross the $20 market and instead sitting at around $16. Cramer promptly said that “I’ve been wrong” because of the price of gold not because “Barrick is bad.” Cramer said that Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is a “good company” and he continues to recommend the stock.In February, Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $0.13, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 16.3% on a YoY basis to reach $2.77 billion, missing estimates by $20 million.A total of 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had reported owning stakes in Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) as of the end of the last quarter of 2022.Old West Management made the following comment about Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is the second largest gold miner in the world, with operations in the U.S., Canada, Africa, South America and more. Barrick is also a major copper producer. Former Goldman Sachs executive John Thornton took control of the company in 2012 and quickly realized he wanted someone with a mining background to run the company. Mark Bristow, at that time CEO of Randgold, was considered one of the best gold mining executives in the world. Thornton wanted Bristow so badly Barrick bought Randgold in 2018. Bristow who is South African, had extensive experience operating mines throughout Africa, and in fact would fly his own single engine plane to visit mines. He has his PhD in Geology, and he has flourished running Barrick the past five years.Barrick is estimated to have $1.6 billion of net income this year on $11.5 billion of revenue. Net Income has been growing 15% per year. The stock trades at $19.00 per share which is 16 times forward earnings, and the stock has a 3.15% dividend yield. Barrick has a fortress balance sheet with $5.7 billion in cash and $5 billion of long term debt, which is only one time EBITDA”9. Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Jim Cramer said in a program earlier this month that Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) is doing “really well” and he likes the stock. Cramer also likes Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)’s restructuring. Like CAH, Jim Cramer is also bullish on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Recently, Baird upgraded Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) to Outperform from Neutral after the company raised its 2023 profit guidance following strong Q4 results.Baird’s analyst Eric Coldwell said in a note to investors that Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) ""deserves to be on board for our positive drug distributor sector call.""Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) has over three decades of consistent dividend increases under its belt.At the end of the last quarter of 2022, 50 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH). The total value of these stakes was $1.3 billion.Ariel Investment made the following comment about Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, distributor of pharmaceutical and medical products Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) advanced in the period as leadership changes were viewed to be a positive for shares. Management provided a new profit outlook for Fiscal 2023 and announced an improvement plan for the medical segment. We are encouraged by these changes and think CAH’s underlying fundamentals and competitive advantages around preventative maintenance screenings and medication management will continue to improve. We believe valuations of health care companies like CAH that focus on cost optimization and promote technological efficiency across the supply chain will be rewarded over the long term.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Jim Cramer earlier this month praised Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and said that he likes the stock. Cramer likes Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)’s at-home COVID testing and anti-diabetes products.Earlier in March, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) said the FDA has cleared its FreeStyle Libre 2 and FreeStyle Libre 3 integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system sensors for integration with automated insulin delivery (AID) systems.In February, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 1.91%. The dividend is payable on March 15 to shareholders of record as of April 14.At the end of the last quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). The total value of these stakes was about $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”7. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the most notable stocks Jim Cramer likes in the tech universe.Jim Cramer recently said in his program that he likes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and that the company is a leader in “many things” including AI.Recently, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) acquired Morphus, a privately held Brazil-based cybersecurity company.Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) also announced recently that Accenture Federal Services, a subsidiary of the company, won a 10-year, $900 million Air Force digital engineering contract.In January, MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis said in a note that companies like Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and IBM are well-positioned in digital transformation.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 63 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN).

We view Accenture as a resilient, high-quality business with consistent earnings and cash flow, a strong balance sheet and very attractive returns on capital. Secular drivers like cloud migration and digital transformation, as well as new, innovative technology deployments like data security, block chain, AI and machine learning position Accenture well for continued growth. It is also currently rolling out a suite of sustainability tools that offers a comprehensive view of a company’s goals, progress and performance across financial and ESG measures, so it is an enabler of ESG for its clients. We exited our position in software-as-a-service company Workday to fund the position, largely on better relative risk/reward, in our view.”6. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Jim Cramer recently said that Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) just had one of the best quarters in the semiconductor industry. He said this is the reason he likes Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI). For the fiscal first quarter, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) posted adjusted EPS of $2.75, beating estimates by $0.15.

321,b358851e-3f57-3268-8187-c7ba9f2a8aaf,MDT,2023-03-09,Abbott (ABT) Makes Progress in the TAVI Space With Navitor,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-abt-makes-progress-tavi-144502766.html,1678200302,STORY,"['EW', 'BSX', 'MDT']","[Abbott ABT recently announced significant progress with Navitor, the company’s latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system. The company announced late-breaking data for Navitor during presentations at the annual Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) meeting held in Washington, D.C. (Feb 25-28, 2023).Results from this study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery.More About the StudyFollowing the development of Abbott's next-generation TAVI system, the company launched the PORTICO NG (Next Generation) study. This prospective, multicenter, international, single-arm trial supports the FDA approval of the Navitor TAVI system that was received back in January 2023.PORTICO NG specifically demonstrates the safety of the Navitor TAVI system and its effectiveness in minimizing blood leakage around the valve implant.In this regard, we note that the Navitor TAVI system, the latest addition to the company's comprehensive transcatheter structural heart portfolio, offers less-invasive treatment options for some of the most common and serious heart diseases.Navitor’s unique fabric cuff (NaviSeal) is expected to reduce or eliminate the backflow of blood around the valve frame, known as the paravalvular leak. Additionally, the new device is the only self-expanding TAVI system with leaflets within the native valve. This design is expected to aid in improving access to coronary arteries to facilitate future procedures for treating coronary artery disease.The Amplatzer Amulet LAA UpdateAbbott also showcased late-breaking data for the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder at the annual CRT meeting. This study highlights the benefits of this device's immediate and complete closure of the LAA for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) at risk of stroke.According to the company, the Amulet IDE trial’s findings demonstrated that the Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder with dual-seal technology (consisting of a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to seal off the opening into the LAA) had fewer unresolved, severe peri-device leaks (PDLs), where blood leaks around the implant, compared to Boston Scientific's BSX Watchman‡ device that has a single component to close the LAA.Story continuesPer Abbott, severe PDLs with Amulet were less commonly associated with adverse events and deaths than BSX’s Watchman.Competitive Niche in Transcatheter Aortic Valve SpacePer a report by Allied Market Research, the global TAVI market was valued at $4,559 million in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $16,937 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 14%. Factors like the increase in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, rise in demand for various TAVI procedures and rise in the elderly population are likely to drive the market.Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device sales grew 22% organically in the last-reported fourth quarter of 2022. Strong utilization in the United States was supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, the company completed the enrollment of the CHAMPION-AF trial ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond.Edwards Lifesciences EW, within TAVR in 2022, received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. The company continued to advance enrollment in the PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from the Alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce Edwards Lifesciences’ long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions.Medtronic MDT, at the same time, despite healthcare staffing challenges, is seeing great physician reception for the company’s Evolut FX system, which just completed its full quarter launch in the United States. Evolut FX combines industry-leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. In addition, data presented at PCR London Valves showed that Evolut FX’s Commissure alignment has improved significantly, which is important for coronary access and valve hemodynamics. Medtronic is currently working to seek Evolut FX’s approval in the Japanese and European markets.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

323,c94cb7ce-0be3-3aa8-b6e0-38bd577a3509,MDT,2023-03-09,Abbott's (ABT) MitraClip Device Shows Favorable Outcome,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbotts-abt-mitraclip-device-shows-130301446.html,1678194181,STORY,"['ABT', 'MDT', 'BSX', 'EW']","[Abbott Laboratories, Inc. ABT recently presented late-breaking data from the Landmark COAPT trial for MitraClip, demonstrating the long-term benefits of the device in patients fighting heart failure. The data were presented at the American College of Cardiology's 72nd Annual Scientific Session together with the World Congress of Cardiology organized in New Orleans between March 4-6, 2023.The recent development will fortify Abbott’s Structural Heart’s business.Study DetailsIn the COAPT trial, symptomatic heart failure patients with severe secondary MR —  a condition in which a leaky valve caused by problems affecting other areas of the heart allows blood to flow back through the mitral valve — were evaluated with MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy or guideline-directed medical therapy alone.The five-year results from the landmark COAPT trial demonstrated that MitraClip is safe, effective and can reduce hospitalizations while improving survival for heart failure patients with severe secondary (or functional) MR.Benefits of Favorable ResultsWith about two decades of clinical experience in transcatheter mitral repair, Abbott's MitraClip paved the way for advancement in supporting people with mitral regurgitation, offering an alternative to surgery for patients who often need treatment to survive.These five-year COAPT results prove that MitraClip is safe and effective at treating secondary MR in advanced heart failure patients, minimizing hospitalizations and helping patients live longer.Per Abbott’s management, these results indicate that MitraClip plays a vital role in enhancing the symptoms of people with this serious heart condition and getting them back to living their fullest lives.Industry ProspectsPer a recent Allied Market Research market, the global structural heart devices market is expected to be worth $12.1 million by 2022, at a CAGR of 10.5%. Given the rising rate of cardiac ailments and the critical need to detect them, we believe Abbott is well-positioned to cash in on the opportunities in this market.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsThis month, Abbott presented late-breaking data for the TriClip transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) system –a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device developed specifically for tricuspid heart valve repair. The TRILUMINATE Pivotal study assesses the superiority of TriClip compared to medical therapy in treating patients with severe, symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) at intermediate or greater risk for open-heart surgery.Last month, Abbott presented late-breaking data for its newest-generation Navitor transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system. The study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at high or greater risk for open-heart surgery. The company also demonstrated late-breaking data for the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder that continue to reflect the benefits of this device's immediate and complete closure of the LAA – a differentiator from competing therapies – for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) at risk of stroke.Developments Within PeersA few other companies like Medtronic plc MDT, Edwards Lifesciences, Inc. EW and Boston Scientific, Inc. BSX are also progressing well within the Heart segment.In February 2023, Medtronic announced the relaunch of its Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV) System – a minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease patients with native or surgically repaired right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Harmony TPV was designed to treat patients with RVOT anomalies who develop severe pulmonary valve regurgitation, a condition where blood leaks back into the right lower chamber of the heart after being pumped into the lungs.In November 2022, Edwards Lifesciences presented one-year results on patients treated in the single-arm, prospective, global, multi-center TRISCEND study of the company’s EVOQUE transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement system which demonstrated favorable safety, efficacy and quality-of-life outcomes.  The one-year outcomes demonstrated high survival and high freedom from heart failure hospitalization.In November 2022, Boston Scientific presented the first results from the ACURATE neo2 Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study evaluating the performance of the ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System. These trial data confirmed the success of meaningful and differentiated enhancements included in the design of the ACURATE neo2 valve, from low rates of PVL and first-time pacemaker implantation to excellent hemodynamic performance and high rates of procedural success and safety.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

County doctors talked her into it anyway, lawsuit says",LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/she-didnt-risky-surgery-county-130033887.html,1678194033,STORY,['MDT'],"[Bernetta Higgins at her home in Silver Lake on June 14, 2022. She says she underwent an unneeded operation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center at the urging of a surgeon who was being paid by a medical device maker. Higgins suffered a stroke during the procedure. (Melody Petersen / Los Angeles Times)For the record:1:33 p.m. March 28, 2023: This article was updated to clarify the damages awarded to Dr. Timothy Ryan. The jury awarded Ryan $2.1 million for emotional distress damages, finding that his acts to stop his employer from filing a false insurance claim were a substantial motivating reason for the county to take adverse actions against him. It also has been updated to include court records that reflect a nurse’s notes stating that Higgins complained of chest pain.After a stay at a Los Angeles County public hospital, Bernetta Higgins was home and feeling better when one of the surgeons called.The doctor, Rodney White, and his nurse told Higgins to return to the emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and tell the staff she had chest pain, according to an email from the nurse documenting the call. Higgins said she wasn’t hurting, but she followed the doctor’s orders and went to the ER. White had told her earlier about “a new experimental surgery” that “would take care of it” — a tear in the lining of her aorta.White signed papers to readmit her and four days later implanted two $15,000 devices into Higgins, then 65. He told her the surgery would take 90 minutes, she testified. Staff wheeled her away in the morning. It wasn’t until night that her mother saw her again. The family learned she had suffered a stroke.“They were talking to me and I couldn’t understand them,” Higgins recalled. “My mom said, ‘What’s wrong with her?’”At the time of the surgery, White and his partner, another Harbor surgeon, were on the payroll of Medtronic, the device’s manufacturer. Drug and device companies often pay doctors to promote and test their products and to teach other physicians about them. Those payments are legal unless they are knowingly paid as a kickback for the doctor’s use of a product — which the surgeons and county claim was not the case here.White's partner testified he was paid by Medtronic only to teach courses for other doctors, including the procedure in which the two implanted the devices into Higgins. White and another doctor also said they were paid for a course held during her surgery. White later changed his testimony, saying the instruction he was paid for happened during an earlier surgery that day.Story continuesThe story of Higgins’ experimental treatment in 2014 only recently became public when a lawsuit brought by Timothy Ryan, the surgeon who first treated her at Harbor, went to trial.Ryan claimed that, based on medical guidelines for treatment of Higgins' illness, she did not need the surgery.“This was done purely to line doctors’ pockets.”Timothy Ryan, vascular surgeonIn his lawsuit, he said no doctors were trained at many of the surgeries claimed to be Medtronic courses. And he contended that the surgeons went through patient charts to find candidates for the expensive medical devices — whether they needed them or not.The experimental surgery on Higgins, who is Black, was part of an extensive research operation that doctors created at Harbor, whose patients are mostly poor and people of color.The research operation has aided drug companies and device makers that use the studies to test their products and promote them. County doctors who have signed industry research agreements receive outside payments for the experimental work. Patients are asked to sign waivers saying they agree to the experiments' risks.Ryan said in the suit that county officials and Harbor doctors retaliated against him when he tried to get them to investigate Higgins’ care and the money the surgeons had been receiving for years from Medtronic.“These are the most vulnerable people in L.A. County,” he said of Harbor’s patients. “This was done purely to line doctors’ pockets.”A jury awarded Ryan $2.1 million in March 2022 for emotional distress damages, finding that his acts to stop his employer from filing a false insurance claim were a substantial motivating reason for the county to take adverse actions against him.County officials disagree with Ryan’s account, including his allegation of retaliation. They say Higgins’ care was “medically sound and within the standard of care” and that White ""acted appropriately."" They added that they ""supported his research relationship with Medtronic.""Medtronic said in a statement that Ryan’s claims do “not reflect Medtronic practices then or now.” The company said it had ""rigorous processes"" to ensure its interactions with physicians ""are consistent with government law and regulations.""White declined to comment.Ryan has filed an appeal, saying a judge's decision before the trial had worked to wrongly limit how much the jury could award him. In December, a judge said the county must pay $3.2 million to cover fees of Ryan's lawyers. The county says it is appealing that decision and the jury’s verdict.After graduating from Harvard Medical School and residency work at Stanford and the Cleveland Clinic, Ryan arrived at Harbor in October 2013. He was excited to join the hospital’s team of vascular surgeons, where White would be his supervisor.Like dozens of other doctors at Harbor, White was both a physician at the eight-story public hospital in Torrance and a scientist at the private research facility, now known as the Lundquist Institute, that sits next door on county land.The county Board of Supervisors granted the private research group access to Harbor’s “facilities, staffing, patients and medical records,” according to the agreement.The arrangement is unusual for a government hospital, or any hospital with a large research operation, because it allowed an outside private group to oversee and manage the studies performed on its patients, who at Harbor are mostly low-income, including many not fluent in English.The county told The Times it believes the research operation at the hospital was “essential to the advancement of medicine” and noted the recent nationwide push to put more minorities into clinical trials when 75% of participants are now white.It has long been controversial for doctors to recruit the poor and other vulnerable people into experiments because of repeated historical scandals where they were misled. One egregious example: a trial that began in 1932 by the U.S. Public Health Service called the “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male.”Other government safety-net hospitals allow clinical trials, but unlike Harbor, most have internal committees to monitor the research and make sure patient volunteers aren’t misled or taken advantage of.Lundquist, a private nonprofit, is not subject to public records laws. Its executives told The Times the institute follows all federal laws governing clinical trials, but they declined to answer a list of questions.According to its website, Lundquist solicits companies, the government and foundations for research grants. It then uses that money to perform and manage the trials led by Harbor doctors and to pay its executives and scientists.Lundquist currently has 600 ongoing research projects, its website says.The institute says it aims to take discoveries made by Harbor doctors and turn them into commercial products.“We are actively seeking to build on our history of successful collaborations with companies both large and small,” it states on its website.Higgins knew none of that when she was admitted to Harbor with abdominal pain in December 2013, where Ryan became her doctor.A CT scan showed her pain was caused by an aortic dissection. The life-threatening condition occurs when the lining of the body’s main artery tears, causing blood to rush through and create a second channel within its layers.If the weakened aorta ruptures, the patient can quickly die. The tear can also heal on its own, which Ryan found was happening for Higgins, he testified.Current medical guidelines, which are recommendations based on a review of the science by experts, say surgeons should avoid surgery when the tear is healing and pain has subsided. That’s because surgery, either by cutting open the patient’s chest or by the new, less invasive method of inserting stent grafts through arteries in the thigh, both come with high risk of stroke, paraplegia and death.Higgins went home without pain after less than a week at Harbor.Ryan didn’t know that White had visited Higgins’ room before she left. White had told her, according to Higgins’ later testimony, that he could do an experimental procedure to “close the leak.” It would avoid having a surgeon cut open her chest, which would be required if her aorta did not heal, White had said.“I was so excited that I don’t remember anything else,” Higgins said.White and his partner Carlos Donayre, another vascular surgeon, had signed agreements with Medtronic dating back to at least 2000. A key part of their agreements were ""courses"" where other physicians or Medtronic employees observed the two as they implanted aortic stent grafts.Several companies make stent grafts, but the contract Donayre signed in 2011 said he must use Medtronic’s devices to get paid the $2,500 fee. “All … courses shall … use FDA-approved Medtronic components and accessories,” it stated.Medtronic had hired White to do even more. Among other things, White was paid to write articles for medical journals on subjects suggested by the company. And he helped lead clinical trials that Medtronic needed to submit to regulators for approval.At the time Higgins was admitted, White was working on 36 research projects for Medtronic, according to Lundquist data. That year, the company paid him as much as $100,000, White testified in court.Medtronic told The Times that hiring physicians was a common practice in the industry. The company, whose operational headquarters are in Minnesota, denied Ryan's claim from the lawsuit that its contract requiring surgeons to use its products in the courses was effectively a kickback. ""If a physician is training another physician on the use of Medtronic products, it necessarily involves our product,” it said.“Medtronic relies on and defers to the independence of physicians’ legal and ethical judgments, as to what is appropriate care,” the company said.Donayre did not respond to email messages seeking comment.Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)Device makers have repeatedly paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits claiming their payments to surgeons were kickbacks for using their products.In 2020, Medtronic paid $8.1 million to settle federal prosecutors' allegations that it had given illegal kickbacks to a South Dakota neurosurgeon to get him to use the company's devices. Prosecutors described the kickbacks as payments Medtronic had provided to cover the cost of more than 100 events held at a restaurant the surgeon owned. Medtronic said the case involved ""a small number of sales employees,"" who were later disciplined or terminated.In July, Biotronik Inc. paid $13 million to settle federal prosecutors’ allegations that it had excessively paid surgeons to train its employees in courses during surgeries where its cardiac devices were implanted. Lawyers for the whistleblowers provided evidence showing that some Biotronik employees were “trained” 100 times by doctors receiving a $400 payment for each surgery said to be educational. In agreeing to the settlement, Biotronik denied the allegations.“Patients deserve to know that their device was selected based on quality of care considerations and not on improper payments from manufacturers,"" said Brian Boynton, principal deputy assistant attorney general, in announcing that settlement.In November 2013, a month after Ryan started at Harbor, a Medtronic executive offered him a proposal where he would receive as much as $4,000 a day for work on the company's programs at Harbor, Ryan said. “It didn’t specify what I had to do for that money,” he said. “It didn’t seem right.” He declined.On Jan. 8, 2014, he was copied on an email from White’s nurse discussing his patient Higgins.“Just wanted to inform you that we informed Ms. Higgins to come through the ER tomorrow morning complaining of chest pain,” the nurse wrote to the staff on White's team. “Dr. White &amp; I spoke to the patient earlier this afternoon. This is our best option.”Higgins’ sister drove her to the ER in the morning. She never complained of chest pain to the staff, who seemed to be expecting her, Higgins told The Times. One triage nurse later testified she did not recall Higgins, but said her notes reflect Higgins complaining that “chest pain started today with the feeling of something [ripping] apart.” Higgins said one staff person told her, “Oh you’re Bernie Higgins. Dr. White is supposed to come and talk to you.”She waited so long in the ER she fell asleep, stretched across two chairs.White wrote a report admitting her to the hospital that night that said Higgins “woke up early this morning with chest pain … accompanied by nausea and dizziness.” He wrote that she had then called his office and his staff “instructed her to go to the ER.”Higgins said none of that was true. She denied it in sworn testimony and a signed declaration.“It was corruption all the way through,” she said.White declined to respond to her allegation of corruption.Higgins spent a month at Harbor recovering from the stroke before the county moved her to a rehabilitation center. For another two months, she lived at that facility, learning to talk again and do tasks that were once simple.“I couldn’t even remember how to use a phone,” she said.She had worked at a law firm before the stroke. Now she struggles to remember how to navigate the streets of her Silver Lake neighborhood.“Bernie was a fast typist. She skipped grades in school,” said her mother, Vernetta Petitt of Compton. After the surgery, “she couldn’t even write her name.”“The joy of my life was reading. Now I can’t read more than a blurb.”Bernetta Higgins, who suffered a stroke after a risky surgeryThe bill for the surgery and nearly four weeks of hospital care after the stroke was $273,871, according to a county document. The federal Medicare program paid $23,682. The rest was covered by county funds. Officials would not say how much her two-month stay at the rehab center cost.In a statement, county officials said that Higgins was “fully informed of the risks of the procedure” and signed a consent form agreeing to be in the study. “Complications from surgery are a normal part of medicine,” the county said.Higgins said she had been so overwhelmed in the hospital that she didn’t read the nine-page consent form that listed stroke and death as possible outcomes. “I signed something without looking at it,” she said.(She filed a lawsuit against White and the county in 2017 with claims that included fraud and medical negligence. Her lawyers based the case on the complaint Ryan had filed. They did not have key documents that later became part of his case. A judge denied most of the claims except for the allegation of fraud, and her lawyers later asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed.)White and his team regularly searched for patients who might be candidates for Medtronic’s devices and could be the subject of the company’s courses, according to emails disclosed as part of Ryan's lawsuit.“Do we have any leads on a dissection case or two for the March 10th course?” wrote George Kopchok, a biomedical engineer who was on the team, to White and his nurse the month after the doctors operated on Higgins’ dissection.Other emails to White and his nurse came from the company's sales reps. The sales reps urged White to get the county to pay for the devices he had implanted in patients so they could get their commission.The Medtronic logo is reflected in a lake at the company's offices in Fridley, Minn. (Jim Mone / Associated Press)Medtronic told The Times it did not pay doctors to endorse or recommend its products. Yet the company repeatedly used comments from White in its marketing materials to promote the device known as the Valiant Captivia.Two weeks after Higgins’ surgery, Medtronic quoted White in a press release about the Valiant. “Data out to one year continue to show positive aortic remodeling,” White said of his patients' outcomes in the release.“This new form of therapy looks ... promising,” he added in a video on Medtronic's website.Medtronic told The Times that White was not paid for his quote in the press release but was simply ""stating his experience"" in using the device in a clinical trial where Medtronic had paid him to enroll patients. The company said he and other physicians were paid for the video but ""were asked to share their personal experience and expertise only.""In the courtroom in March, the county’s lawyers put an expert, Niten Singh, a vascular surgeon at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, on the stand. He told the jury the procedure was needed because Higgins had gone to the ER with chest pain.Under cross-examination by Ryan's lawyer, Singh acknowledged that the county's lawyers had not given him Higgins' testimony to review. In it, Higgins said she did not have chest pain and had gone to the ER only because White told her to.Asked if he would have offered Higgins surgery if he knew she did not have pain, Singh said no.Instead, he said, he would have monitored her aorta through continuing visits and CT scans.Whether Higgins needed the surgery was also a key question for White and Donayre during the trial.In a deposition before the trial, White testified Higgins had “a lethal kind of problem” — that she had both chest pain and blood leaking from her aorta into her chest.Pressed to explain why he then waited four days to perform the surgery, White explained that Higgins was part of a Medtronic course scheduled for that Monday.“We settled her down,"" he said, ""got her figured out, and did her then.""White changed his testimony on the witness stand.He said Medtronic had paid him $2,500 for a course on the day of Higgins’ surgery but that it involved another patient.White again said Higgins’ surgery was necessary because she had pain and her aorta was deteriorating.Ryan's lawyer showed jurors the CT scan the surgeons had ordered for Higgins the day after White admitted her.It showed her aorta was improving. Singh, the county's expert, testified the scan showed the fluid around her lungs had diminished and that blood was no longer freely flowing through the second channel that had formed in the aorta's lining. Instead, it had clotted. The scan showed no blood outside her aorta, Singh said.But in his report on the operation, White’s partner Donayre had written that she had a “left hemothorax.” That bleeding into her chest, he wrote, was the reason for surgery.Asked about the CT scan that showed no such bleeding, White pivoted.He told the jury he had found another problem not mentioned in Higgins’ medical record. White said he had “reconstructed” the CT scan with an earlier test and found a “rapid enlargement” of Higgins’ aorta.Ryan’s lawyer showed the jury notes that White and the other doctors had written at the time of the surgery in Higgins’ chart. There was no mention of an enlargement. And Singh, the county’s expert, said he found that portions of her aorta were ""slightly smaller” just before the surgery.White continued to testify that Higgins needed the surgery because she had chest pain.“She was on a number of pain medications, starting with morphine,” he told the jury.Ryan’s lawyer showed the jury Higgins’ list of medications. There was no morphine or any other pain drug.White responded that a drug she was taking to reduce blood pressure could be considered a pain medication.White entered Higgins into a clinical trial that he began at Harbor in 2002, according to hospital documents and a federal database. He wrote in the protocol that he planned to recruit hundreds of patients with aortic problems and implant a Medtronic stent to determine whether it was safe and effective, including for uses regulators had not yet approved.He recruited 303 patients for the trial over the years, according to a spreadsheet that White's nurse gave to Ryan. Higgins was the last on the list.Twenty years after the study began there are no published results.Federal regulations require results to be published within a year of the trial’s completion. Those rules help protect patients from being asked to volunteer for risky experiments where results are never released and science doesn’t advance to help the public.County officials declined to answer many of The Times' questions. In a statement, they said they were proud of White, who was involved in early development of the stent grafts.The statement said Ryan’s complaints were “clouded” by the fact he had earlier filed a federal lawsuit against Medtronic, claiming that he had helped invent the stent graft and that his name should have been on its patent. Therefore the patent was invalid, he claimed, and the government was being defrauded by paying an inflated price. A judge dismissed the case.White retired in 2016 on his annual county pension and benefits of $262,000, according to government data collected by Transparent California. He continues to work as a surgeon part time at the Long Beach Medical Center.County officials described Medtronic’s payments to the doctors as consulting fees to teach other surgeons about the company’s device — which they said was “a fairly common practice” in medicine.Unlike most other hospitals with large research operations, Harbor does not have an institutional review board to monitor the studies. IRBs are committees in charge of protecting research subjects. Instead, Harbor and the county delegated that responsibility to the Lundquist Institute.“The notion that Harbor’s IRB process is somehow less accountable or inferior because it is an external entity is categorically flawed,” wrote Bari Golin-Blaugrund, an executive at Actum, a consulting and crisis communications firm, hired by the county, in an email.The county continues to allow Harbor doctors to accept large payments from medical companies.Matthew Budoff, a Harbor cardiologist, received $558,227 in 2021 from 10 pharmaceutical companies, according to a federal database. The payments were mostly for consulting or speaking to other doctors about the companies’ new drugs.Budoff said the database was wrong and some of that money was not paid to him directly but had gone to Lundquist to support clinical trials he worked on for the companies. While he continues to care for Harbor patients, he said, most of his time is spent on research and his salary comes from Lundquist. “I always disclose my conflicts of interest,” he said.Some scientists have raised questions about the design and conclusion of a trial in which Budoff found the fish oil drug Vascepa worked to reduce artery plaque. They say the mineral oil he gave as placebos to patients in the control group appeared to increase their coronary plaque, leading to a false conclusion the drug worked. In an interview, Budoff said he would not have used mineral oil as a placebo had he known then about its possible adverse effects. He said no patients were harmed and that he didn't believe the placebo had significantly changed the trial's conclusion.In her small living room in Silver Lake, Higgins surrounds herself with dozens of photos of family and friends. Because of the stroke, her mind still slips, she says, and the photos help her remember who they are.The framed pictures show her life before her stroke. There was an annual rafting trip on the Kern River. She once relished taking her nieces and nephews on ski trips to Mammoth.When a reporter visited her in June, she spoke of the 2,000 books she had collected. She pointed to one on the shelf behind her, ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy.“Have you read this?” she asked.“The joy of my life was reading,” she said. “Now I can’t read more than a blurb.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Medtronic, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Medtronic. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Medtronic's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Medtronic is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.2% and 4.5% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Medtronic plc in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$99m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Medtronic. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

PFA is a breakthrough ablation technology that uses pulsed electric fields to efficiently isolate the pulmonary veins for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF.PULSED AF is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the PulseSelect System for the treatment of AF in adult patients with a history of drug refractory, recurrent and symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF. The trial is a prospective, single arm, multi-center clinical trial that treated 300 patients (150 with paroxysmal AF and 150 with persistent AF). Patients were enrolled across 41 sites in nine countries with 67 operators throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan.Story continuesStudy Results: SafetyThe study exceeded its performance goal of freedom from a composite of serious procedure and device-related adverse events with a 0.7% (p=0.002) rate of primary adverse events in both patient cohorts. There were no esophageal events, instances of pulmonary vein stenosis, or phrenic nerve injury.""Uniquely, these results represent the first prospective, global, large-scale study with two different, rigorously monitored patient populations that demonstrates an impressively low adverse event rate of 0.7%,"" said Atul Verma, M.D., electrophysiologist and director, Division of Cardiology, McGill University Health Centre in Montreal and principal investigator (PI) for the PULSED AF study. ""The results of PFA trials have been highly anticipated among the EP community to help us treat the growing number of AF patients around the world. The high rate of 80% or more in clinical success and the promising safety and efficiency results from PULSED AF will help establish PFA as an exciting new option for patients.""Study Results: Efficacy PULSED AF exceeded the threshold for efficacy performance at 66% efficacy in paroxysmal AF patients and 55% in persistent AF patients (p&lt;0.001), based on the pre-specified performance goals of &gt;50% (paroxysmal) and &gt;40% (persistent) at 12 months. The PULSED AF primary effectiveness endpoint included a composite of measures based on efficacy endpoints across multiple studies of radiofrequency (RF) and cryoablation energy sources. The composite endpoint included freedom from acute procedural failure, arrhythmia recurrence, repeat ablation, direct current cardioversion, left atrial surgery, or antiarrhythmic escalation through twelve months, excluding a 3-month blanking period.Freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence at 12 months was 70% in the paroxysmal cohort and 62% in the persistent. Additionally, clinical success, freedom from recurrence of any symptomatic atrial arrhythmias, was 80% for paroxysmal and 81% for the persistent cohort.""Today's findings demonstrate a critical achievement in the decade-long commitment we have made to researching PFA and underscores our confidence in the PulseSelect System,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president, Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""We are taking the same comprehensive approach to PFA that we took with the introduction of the single-shot Arctic Front Advance™ cryoballoon, and that involves building a deep, extensive  body of clinical evidence and strong collaboration with clinicians globally. The single-shot PulseSelect System, together with the focal Affera Sphere-9™ mapping and ablation catheter, will allow us to offer a complementary suite of PFA technologies to help treat patients with AF and other arrhythmias.""About Patient Monitoring StrategiesPublished PFA studies utilize different monitoring frequency and endpoints. For PULSED AF, patients underwent rigorous arrhythmia monitoring with assessments at three, six, and 12 months, and weekly symptomatic trans-telephonic monitoring. 96% (287) of patients completed the 12-month follow up. PFA study results cannot be directly compared; however, to show the impact of how monitoring differences affect outcome measurements, Medtronic analyzed its own data using the monitoring frequency and endpoints used in other PFA studies9 and found the PULSED AF outcomes to be higher when using those metrics.The single-shot PulseSelect System delivers pulsed electric fields through an ablation catheter designed specifically to interrupt irregular electrical pathways in the heart that trigger AF. However, unlike traditional methods of ablation that heat (radiofrequency ablation) or cool (cryoablation) the atrial tissue, the PulseSelect System uses a non-thermal approach and preferentially targets heart tissue with the goal of avoiding unwanted injury to surrounding structures, a risk of current ablation technologies. Worldwide, the PulseSelect System is investigational and not approved for sale or distribution.

Antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy has been the current standard first-line treatment, however, AAD therapy is ineffective at controlling AF in approximately half of patients treated with drug therapy.6-8Any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties such as those described in Medtronic's periodic reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(NYSE:CCI) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Crown CastleOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO of Fiber, Christopher Levendos, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$193 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$127. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 3.91k shares worth US$519k. But they sold 19.50k shares for US$3.7m. In total, Crown Castle insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Crown Castle insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$270m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Crown Castle Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Crown Castle shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Crown Castle, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

The study had achieved its primary endpoint of sotatercept exhibiting significant improvement in exercise capacity, as measured by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) following 24 weeks of treatment initiation.However, in the present press release, the company said that sotatercept increased 6MWD by 40.8 meters from baseline at week 24.In the past year, shares of Merck shot up 43% against the industry’s decline of 7.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdditionally, the study also achieved meaningful improvements in eight of nine key secondary outcome measures that included statistically significant improvements in WHO functional class and pulmonary vascular resistance.Sotatercept reduced the risk of clinical deterioration or death by 84% in comparison with placebo with a median follow-up of 32.7 weeks. The safety profile of the drug is reported to be consistent with prior study data. Adverse events from the treatment with sotatercept were observed in 90.8% of the enrolled patients in comparison with 91.9% of patients treated with placebo.Severe adverse reactions in treatment with sotatercept and placebo, separately, were observed in 12.9% and 18.1% of patients, respectively. Common complications included bleeding events, telangiectasia, increased hemoglobin levels, thrombocytopenia, increased blood pressure and dizziness.PAH is a rare, progressive, blood vessel disorder that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart resulting in elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. In the United States, an estimated 40,000 people currently live with PAH. It exerts significant strain on the heart consequentially causing limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy.Story continuesPAH is hence life-threatening with a five-year mortality rate for patients with PAH of approximately 43%. Per management, sotatercept expresses the potential to target cellular signaling associated with vascular hyperproliferation and pathological remodeling for the treatment of PAH. Merck plans to hold discussions with the FDA soon regarding the pivotal data from the phase III STELLAR study to launch sotatercept as soon as possible.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Jenkins in the lab, ca. 1969.A diverse workforce is not only fundamental to the company's future success, but it's also a part of its rich history. Taking a look back in time, the company highlights the contributions of Black leaders and company milestones that have made an impact on diversity and innovation in its past, present and future.A long history of Black inventors and innovators1. Susan Jenkins paved the way for black women in science at MerckSusan Jenkins began a long career at Merck in 1957 when she joined Merck Research Laboratories (MRL) as one of its first female Black chemists. She was part of the team that first synthesized ribonuclease. Later, she joined the company's corporate equal employment affairs department and served as a black university liaison. By the end of her career here, Susan was senior vice president of human resources and was emblematic of how important having Black women leaders in science was to creating an inclusive work environment.Susan returned to the company almost 50 years later to attend the presentation of the Citation for Chemical Breakthrough award from the American Chemical Society (ACS) division of the History of Chemistry. The Citation for Chemical Breakthrough was awarded in honor of the series of five articles published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society describing the first total synthesis of an enzyme. These articles were authored by Dr. Ralph Hirschmann and his colleagues in 1969, one of whom was Susan.2. William Bowers' advocacy for civil rights at work and across the countryMerck alumni include numerous prominent Black civil rights leaders, including William ""Bill"" Bowers. Bill joined the company in 1951 as a technician, a position he held until 1969 when he received a bachelor of science degree in business management from Rutgers University. He earned his degree with assistance from the company's educational grant program while balancing his full-time job, four children and many leadership positions in his community, including vice president of the Westfield Community Development Corporation.Story continuesBill retired from a project management position at the company in 1993. He was a vocal proponent for civil rights nationally and within the company, having participated in the 1963 March on Washington. He was a co-founder of Black Employees at Merck (BEAM), which later became Merck's Black Employees Network (BEN) and is known today as LEAD - Merck's League of Employees of African Descent, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2020.3. Baseball star Jimmy Dean found a second career at MerckDuring the late 1940s, Negro League baseball featured a star pitcher named Jimmy Dean. Famous for his sinker-ball, Jimmy pitched for the Philadelphia Stars facing legends like Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron.After the integration of Major League Baseball started to draw athletes and fans away from the Negro Leagues, Jimmy returned to school and began working for Merck. Jimmy traveled extensively, put three sons through college and after 33 years, he retired from his position as a technical analyst in 1990.Our commitment to diversity in science careers1. Investing in future science leadersIn 1968, Merck began sponsoring the Technical Training Program (TTP), a non-profit organization in Newark, New Jersey, which offered classes and on-the-job laboratory experience for students interested in pharmaceutical industry careers. TTP primarily targeted young people from educationally and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Among TTP's first graduating class were William ""Gary"" Mickle and Darrell Harris who became laboratory technicians in MRL. Gary would ultimately work in MRL for over 35 years.2. Prioritizing equal opportunities for Black and minority employeesIn 1968, Merck appointed Lawrence ""Larry"" Branch vice president of personnel relations, responsible for coordinating and recommending programs for employment, training, and promotion of persons from all minority groups. This new position marked the beginnings of Merck's Office of Equal Employment Affairs - one of the first in the country to prioritize equity for black employees, among many other initiatives. Over the years, the Office of Equal Employment Affairs continued to evolve, establishing company-wide programming to address complex workplace issues such as racism, sexism and other barriers to equality. The programming was so successful it served as a model to other corporations, government organizations and community groups.3. Merck celebrated for innovative diversity programs that support its Black employeesDuring the 1980s, Merck was recognized for its leadership in equal opportunity employment. As national politics surrounding affirmative action grew to be more complex, the company maintained its focus on welcoming and supporting diverse employees. The 1983 book ""The Hundred Best Companies to Work for in America"" listed Merck as No. 15, specifically citing its diversity initiatives.That same year Merck's commitment to equal opportunity earned recognition from the United States Department of Labor with its Exemplary Voluntary Efforts Award. Then in 1989, the company was included on Black Enterprise magazine's first-ever list of the 50 Best Places for Blacks to Work. Ever since, Merck has maintained a consistent presence on lists praising corporate diversity published by Black Enterprise, Forbes and more.View the original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/merck-co-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742461/Black-Scientists-Innovators-and-Employees-are-Key-to-Mercks-History-of-Invention-and-Progress]"

338,d47bf500-f40b-3c30-9874-3b90dd864c53,ROK,2023-03-09,Rockwell Automation (ROK) Is Up 4.20% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-rok-4-20-170005258.html,1678294805,STORY,['ROK'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Rockwell Automation (ROK), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Rockwell Automation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if ROK is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this industrial equipment and software maker holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ROK, shares are up 4.2% over the past week while the Zacks Industrial Automation and Robotics industry is up 0.73% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.43% compares favorably with the industry's 0.09% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Rockwell Automation have increased 10.16% over the past quarter, and have gained 9.46% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.77% and -3.48%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ROK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ROK is currently averaging 547,297 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ROK.Over the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ROK's consensus estimate, increasing from $10.65 to $11.18 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ROK is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Rockwell Automation on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Energy Drive, an energy specialist headquartered in Durban, South Africa, used Rockwell drive technologies to help its customer, Sibanye-Stillwater, improve and accelerate the energy efficiency of its mine ventilation systems.Using Rockwell's PowerFlex® 6000T variable frequency drives to control and reduce fan speeds, Energy Drive delivered an average of 62% in energy savings in the first shaft and 48% in the second. The two upgraded shafts have been operational for nearly a year, and they'll soon commission a third shaft.The new efficiencies-which have delivered annual energy savings of more than 55 GWh-will help Sibanye-Stillwater address some core goals of its ESG activities and deliver a total energy saving of about 360 GWh over the term of the contract - equivalent to removing 5,000 South African homes from the grid every month. It will save 379,000 tons of carbon over the period, while significantly reducing water and coal consumption.""Ultimately, what we do is deliver energy savings and with that, we deliver carbon reduction,"" said James Hynd, CEO of Energy Drive. ""If you think about our offering, it's supporting and partnering around delivering sustainability for clients to achieve their targets. It's the right thing to do and for that to be achieved at not just low cost, but at a net savings is quite significant.""Addressing the partnership between Energy Drive and Rockwell Automation, Tom O'Reilly, Rockwell's vice president of Sustainability noted, ""We share a common vision to provide the most efficient and sustainable solutions for customers and the environment.

ROK scaled a new 52-week high of $303.20 on Mar 3 before closing the session a tad lower at $302.59. This came following the announcement of Rockwell Automation acquiring Knowledge Lens on Mar 1.ROK currently has a market capitalization of $34.7 billion and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In the past year, Rockwell Automation’s shares have gained 14.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 11.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Driving FactorsRockwell Automation delivered improvement in the bottom and top lines in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, aided by higher sales volume and positive price/cost.The company has been benefiting from improved order levels over the past few quarters. Solid underlying demand from customers across many industries and regions has been driving low order cancellation rates. Moreover, huge capital investments across many end markets, coupled with higher automation and digital transformation, have been supporting solid order levels across all segments.Sales from Information Solutions and Connected Services are gaining from strong order wins from software and infrastructure services. Customers in life sciences, food and beverage, mining and many other end markets rely on Rockwell Automation to provide robust network technology and real-time domain expertise to keep their critical operations secure and resilient. ROK’s Life Sciences solutions business is well-placed to gain from a wide range of product offerings and Sensis JV.Even though the company’s top line has been bearing the brunt of supply-chain challenges and cost inflation, this has been offset by solid backlog levels.Moreover, Rockwell Automation has been focused on buyouts, which will augment its information solutions, and high-value services offerings and capabilities, while expanding its global presence or enhancing process expertise.Recently, it acquired a services and solutions provider based in India, Knowledge Lens. The addition of Knowledge Lens will expand Rockwell’s capabilities to harness the power of data and enable autonomous manufacturing.Backed by these tailwinds, Rockwell Automation reported net sales of $1,981 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The figure marks growth of 6.7% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,892 million. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81. The bottom line rose 15% year over year.Earnings estimates for Rockwell Automation have also been going up over the past two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 bottom line has increased 4.4% and the same for fiscal 2024 has moved up 2.2%. The consensus estimate for fiscal second-quarter 2023 earnings has also been revised 1.6% upward over the same time frame.

And there's progress. It's about six months between when it's certified and we can put it into service,"" Jordan told reporters at an Aero Club event in Washington. ""We're not counting on it to be in service here in 2023.""Jordan said his ""best guess"" is it will be in service by Southwest in early 2024.Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen earlier on Wednesday declined to comment on the timeline of when the agency might approve the MAX 7.Boeing said it continues to work with the FAA to meet the requirements for MAX 7 and MAX 10 certification. ""As always, we will follow global regulators' lead in the steps ahead on all certification matters,"" a company spokesman said.Boeing, which has faced supply chain issues, delivered 69 planes to Southwest in 2022, down 45 jets from the 114 the company planned to deliver, Jordan said, adding Boeing has agreed to boost deliveries this year.Boeing has unfilled orders of 388 737 MAXs for Southwest and 271 of those are for MAX 7s.""Boeing is committed to 100 this year, so that's going to push aircraft into '24.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks.There has been a global energy crisis since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. European countries realized they heavily relied on Russian natural gas and crude oil and needed to transition away from these sources to reduce their dependence. During the conflict, the price of crude oil and natural gas spiked significantly due to global uncertainty, and the importance of oil and gas supply took center stage in the political landscape. As a result, there has been an acceleration in the installation of renewable energy resources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the capacity growth of renewable energy is set to double in the next five years. During this process, renewable energy sources will overtake coal and become the biggest energy source for the generation of electricity.The IEA anticipates the capacity of renewable energy to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) during the 2022 to 2027 period. The increase in the capacity growth of renewable energy is 30% higher than the forecast one year ago. This reflects the positive intent of governments around the world on transforming towards renewable energy sources. The IEA also notes that 90% of the increase in electricity capacity globally will be done through renewable sources, and as a result, renewable energy will become the biggest source of electricity generation by early 2025. IEA Director Fatih Birol shared that in the next five years, the world will add as much renewable energy as in the last two decades.Besides Europe, India, China, and the US are also aggressively pursuing the rollout of renewable energy at various levels. The 14th Five-Year Plan rolled out by China in January 2022 focuses on making China a behemoth in the field of renewable energy, as the country will be responsible for nearly 50% of new capacity additions through renewable energy during the 2022 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 in the US intends to provide long-term support to the aggressive expansion and adoption of renewable energy by various corporations. Meanwhile, India is also set to increase its investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion between 2022 to 2027. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) are some of the most profitable renewable energy stocks in the industry currently.Story continues12 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocksermess/Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyA thorough research was conducted on the renewable energy sector, including its current market trends, growth projections, and key players, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and identify the most promising companies within it. We then shortlisted the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks on the basis of their trailing 12 months’ net income. We have included non-pure play companies in the list as well that have significant exposure to the renewable sector. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their net income.Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks13. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB)Trailing 12 months Net Income: $1.91 billionEnbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is a Calgary, Alberta-based pipeline and energy company.The company has invested more than $6 billion (C$8 billion) in renewable energy since its first investment in a wind farm back in 2002. Presently, the company produces 5,192 megawatts (MW) gross of zero-emission energy, which is enough to provide power to 969,000 homes. This makes Enbridge Inc.

The company has deployed wind farms, solar energy operations, waste heat recovery facilities, geothermal projects, power transmission projects, and hydroelectric facilities to produce renewable energy. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is focused on becoming a net-zero emission entity by 2050 through these initiatives. The company has a headcount of over 12,000 employees, mainly across the US and Canada.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”12.

357,47fdb4fe-b50e-31cf-a14b-5100990f4828,SO,2023-03-09,Georgia nuclear plant begins splitting atoms for first time,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/georgia-nuclear-plant-begins-splitting-020042959.html,1678154442,STORY,['SO'],"[ATLANTA (AP) — A nuclear power plant in Georgia has begun splitting atoms in one of its two new reactors, Georgia Power said Monday, a key step toward reaching commercial operation at the first new nuclear reactors built from scratch in decades in the United States.The unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. said operators reached self-sustaining nuclear fission inside the reactor at Plant Vogtle, southeast of Augusta. That makes the intense heat that will be used to produce steam and spin turbines to generate electricity.A third and a fourth reactor were approved for construction at Vogtle by the Georgia Public Service Commission in 2009, and the third reactor was supposed to start generating power in 2016. The company now says Unit 3 could begin commercial operation in May or June.Unit 4 is projected to begin commercial operation sometime between this November and March 2024.The cost of the third and fourth reactors was originally supposed to be $14 billion. The reactors are now supposed to cost more than $30 billion. That doesn't include $3.68 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid to the owners after going bankrupt, which brings total spending to more than $34 billion.The latest set of delays at Unit 3 included a pipe part of a critical backup cooling system that was vibrating during startup testing. Construction workers had failed to install supports called for on blueprints. The company has also said it had to repair a slowly dripping valve and diagnose a problem involving water flow through reactor coolant pumps.Georgia Power said Unit 3 would continue startup testing to show that its cooling system and steam supply system will work at the intense heat and pressure that a nuclear reactor creates. After that, operators are supposed to link the reactor to the electrical grid and gradually raise it to full power.“We remain focused on safely bringing this unit online, fully addressing any issues and getting it right at every level,” Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power, said in a written statement. “Reaching initial criticality is one of the final steps in the startup process and has required tremendous diligence and attention to detail from our teams.”Story continuesGeorgia Power owns a minority of the two new reactors. The remaining shares are owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp., the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Oglethorpe and MEAG would sell power to cooperatives and municipal utilities across Georgia, as well in Jacksonville, Florida, and parts of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.Georgia Power's 2.7 million customers are already paying part of the financing cost, and state regulators have approved a monthly rate increase of $3.78 a month as soon as the third unit begins generating power. The elected Georgia Public Service Commission will decide later who pays for the remainder of the costs.Vogtle is the only nuclear plant under construction in the United States. Its costs and delays could deter other utilities from building such plants, even though they generate electricity without releasing climate-changing carbon emissions.___Follow Jeff Amy at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.]"

Initial criticality is a key step during the startup testing sequence and demonstrates that -- for the first time -- operators have safely started the nuclear reaction inside the reactor. This means atoms are being split and nuclear heat is being made, which will be used to produce steam.A reactor achieves criticality when the nuclear fission reaction becomes self-sustaining. Achieving initial criticality is necessary to continue the startup of the Unit in order to generate sufficient heat for the production of electricity.""We remain focused on safely bringing this unit online, fully addressing any issues and getting it right at every level. Reaching initial criticality is one of the final steps in the startup process and has required tremendous diligence and attention to detail from our teams,"" said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""When you consider the history of safe and reliable operations at Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for decades now, it puts today's milestone in perspective that Plant Vogtle will be a four-unit site making it the largest of its kind in the U.S. This is a truly exciting time as we prepare to bring online a new nuclear unit that will serve our state with clean and emission-free energy for the next 60 to 80 years.""Vogtle Unit 3 continues with startup testing which demonstrates the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system at design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. Now that the Unit 3 reactor has reached criticality, operators will continue to raise power to support synchronizing the generator to the electric grid and begin producing electricity. Then, operators will continue increasing power through multiple steps, ultimately raising power to 100 percent. These tests are designed to ensure all systems are operating together and to validate operating procedures prior to declaration of Commercial Operation. The in-service date for Unit 3 is projected during May or June 2023.Story continuesThe new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero air pollution, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Skyworks Solutions'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skyworks Solutions is:21% = US$1.2b ÷ US$5.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo begin with, Skyworks Solutions seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 10% seen over the past five years by Skyworks Solutions.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Skyworks Solutions' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 28% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SWKS? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Skyworks Solutions Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Skyworks Solutions has a three-year median payout ratio of 29%, which implies that it retains the remaining 71% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, Skyworks Solutions has paid dividends over a period of nine years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 22% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 27%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Skyworks Solutions' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the aforementioned contract.Details of the DealValued at $70.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide integrated logistics support in preparing Kuwait pilots for delivery of the Kuwait F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.The aforementioned integrated logistics support includes general logistics support; logistics program management; logistics support to aircraft during pilot training within the continental U.S. (CONUS); and maintenance of aircraft, aircraft armament equipment, F414 engines, and Sniper pods. It also includes logistics representative support within and outside the CONUS ferry support; packaging, handling, storage and transportation; and program security tasks.The deal will serve the government of Kuwait, with majority of the work projected to be executed in New Orleans, LA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT .Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a 4.6% improvement from the 2022 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.9%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.86%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2023 sales implies a 8.1% improvement from the 2022 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have gained 27.2% in the past 12 months against the industry’s 12.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

When times are difficult, however, many companies might cut or suspend their dividends.The best dividend stocks often have also increased their annual dividends through multiple market cycles including tough economic recessions.Many dividend stocks have faced fairly substantial headwinds in 2022 given the high inflation which has led to higher interest rates. With higher interest rates, U.S. Treasury yield have increased considerably. As of March 6, the U.S. 10 year Treasury bond has increased 224 basis points in one year to a yield of 3.98%.Given the U.S. 10 year Treasury bond's yield, Treasury bonds have higher yields than many blue chip dividend stocks even though Treasury bonds have substantially lower risk. As a result, considerable capital has flowed out of dividend stocks and the broader market and into the U.S. Treasuries. The capital outflow has led to some lower valuations for many blue chip dividend stocks as a result.Nevertheless, there is still hope that the Federal Reserve will win its fight against inflation in the next few years. If that happens, interest rates could decrease, and capital could flow back into blue chip dividend stocks, giving them potentially a better valuation.Story continuesFor those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.When it comes to dividend stocks, it could be a good idea to own blue chips since companies with fewer competitive advantages might not be able to sustain their dividends as well over the long term. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Software, Technology, ComputerPhoto by Luke Peters on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 13 stocks that paid dividends at least once a year that are regarded by many investors as blue chips.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.13 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

366,0ea0aef6-d6fe-3907-8d15-3a3652b734a7,NKE,2023-03-09,Is Nike (NKE) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-nke-buy-wall-street-143002530.html,1678285802,STORY,['NKE'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nike (NKE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NKE a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $3.12.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike.

Hall said she was expecting ""a bounce"" coming into 2023, ""given just how negative sentiment had been"" at the end of 2022. Hall revealed that her year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4000. However, she thinks ""there's more potential downside risk"" since a lot of indicators she looks at that could ""signal a potential bottom in the market haven't been hit yet"". Hall sees markets being volatile in 2023 and noted that there are ""better opportunities in spots of the market"" one of which was small-cap stocks.Hall thinks the U.S. will enter a ""mild recession"" in the second half of 2023, that will ""last into early next year (2024)"". Hall noted that ""usually, S&amp;P earnings declined about 20% during an average recession"" and her estimates for earnings declines are ""less than half of that"". Hall said that though ""there has been strength in the data"", ""earnings have generally been in-line to a slight miss"". Hall thinks ""there's more downside risk to earnings forecasts"" but she does not think it would be ""as dramatic as we usually see during a recession"". Hall later discussed the ""spots of the market"" she likes. Here are some comments from Jill Carey Hall:""When you look at what's priced in already, how positioning is, you get some different results than the typical recessionary playbook. Also when you look at the shifting risk profiles of sectors, some of the traditionally safer low-beta sectors have actually become higher beta and vice versa. So we're overweight some of the more cyclical sectors right now. Energy, materials, financials, and then we're overweight staples, that's sort of our preferred high-quality defensive sector.""Story continuesAs of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.79% year to date, the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.54% since the beginning of the year, and the Russell 2000 is up 10.14% for the year.

While we think the brand has enormous global value and appeal, the Achilles heel has always been the existence of voting control stock that enables the founding family to essentially run this like a captive weekend lemonade stand with all that attendant discipline to cost and interest in shareholder returns.

The company continued to generate strong free cash flow that it is using to invest into its casinos, pay out dividends, and buy back shares. The company has repurchased 8% of its shares over the past year while paying out a 1% dividend. We believe Boyd can withstand any bumps in the economy given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow. We also don’t think Boyd’s share price reflects its 5% ownership in online bookmaker FanDuel.

Smith University more than two decades ago still influences his current job at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). ""I gained confidence to believe I have a voice and belong at the table,"" recalled Clarke about his time at the Charlotte-based historically Black college in the 90s. ""You learn how to create an inclusive environment, how to build grit and integrity, and how to show up strong as your authentic self.""Clarke, Wells Fargo's global head of University Programs Recruiting and North America Targeted Sourcing leader, said his HBCU experience set him up for success by helping him become an expert at forging relationships. Now, he's paying it forward by recruiting HBCU students for early career talent programs at Wells Fargo, including the Junior Leaders Conference, the #ChangeMakers Summit, and the HBCU Freshman Summer Experience in Corporate and Investment Banking.A long-standing partnership with HBCUsSince the murder of George Floyd and the racial reckoning that followed, more companies have turned to HBCUs to help diversify their workforce.""Over the last two years we've seen a lot of firms putting more support toward HBCUs,"" said Dewey Norwood, senior lead Diversity &amp; Inclusion consultant. ""We're seeing some new partners that may not have been engaged before but are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion within their respective industry.""Wells Fargo's engagement with HBCUs goes back decades, but it was in 2005 when Wachovia, now Wells Fargo, dedicated resources and expanded partnerships with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF). These national organizations provide scholarships to students and financial support to member HBCUs.""What makes me smile is our long-standing commitments and significant investments in HBCUs,"" Norwood said. ""Wells Fargo has provided more than $34 million to support HBCU students over the last 10 to 12 years.""Story continuesThe company also sponsors events that create ways to engage future leaders and support HBCU students on their higher-education journeys. One such event is the TMCF Leadership Institute, a national conference that develops HBCU students' leadership skills and prepares them to compete in today's global workforce. Shantae Joseph, senior vice president for External Engagement, said Wells Fargo extended nearly 50 job offers to students on-site at last year's event.""It's knowing that we are able to show up for talent we might recruit in the future,"" Joseph said. ""It's about investing in their development and investing the time for them to see leaders that look like them. In return, we're able to showcase what we offer as a company.""Working to diversify wealth managementIn the United States, the median Black family owns just 2% of the wealth a median white family owns. Even though a recent report from the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility found more than half of Black survey respondents were looking to financial services to help build long-term wealth, only 1.8% of certified financial planners are Black or African American.""If we don't look more like the communities we serve, it will be to our detriment,"" said Shannon Tolbert, Wealth &amp; Investment Management's head of External Engagement and Program Development. ""The wealth gap is large. If we increase diversity in financial advising, specifically in the Black and African American population, we will experience even more passion around reducing that wealth gap.""In an effort to address this shortage, Wells Fargo has created Building Diverse Pathways, a program that creates a path for students to build a career in wealth management. The program paves the way toward wealth gap reduction, said Tolbert.Building Diverse Pathways aims to increase the diversity of the company's financial advisor population by engaging with HBCUs and national partners to produce a pipeline of candidates interested in entering the financial services industry.Investing in HBCUs and their communitiesIn Florida, Wells Fargo's Philanthropy and Community Impact team is highly engaged and continues its long-standing partnership with the state's HBCUs, including Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, or FAMU, and Bethune-Cookman University, supporting everything from student engagement activities to financial health sessions.""HBCUs should be viewed and leveraged as anchor institutions in the community,"" said Candice Simmons, senior business execution consultant. ""Some of the things we've done in Florida are positioning them as such.""Recently, Wells Fargo provided more than $280,000 in grants to FAMU to support several initiatives. In Tallahassee, the grant funded the launch of a small business incubator to assist women- and minority-owned businesses in the community.Wells Fargo has supported the FAMU Small Business Development Center since 2013. ""When we support small businesses, we support local jobs,"" said Valerie Jenkins, senior community relations specialist and the proud mother of an HBCU graduate. ""An investment in the FAMU Small Business Incubator is an investment in our community.""The pandemic created new challenges for the business community, said Jenkins. The opening of the Small Business Incubator allows FAMU the opportunity to expand their core business sessions that focus more on sustainability, growth, and resilience to help small businesses pivot during times of uncertainty.The funds also supported FAMU's College of Law Economic Justice Initiative, which aims to provide free legal services to Black and minority-owned small businesses in Orlando. With the funding, the university's College of Law announced its second cohort of Economic Justice and Advocacy Fellows. Both initiatives give students an opportunity to work with underserved communities in Central Florida.In 2022, Wells Fargo celebrated the historic statue honoring civil rights pioneer Mary McLeod Bethune, educator and founder of a school for girls, which would eventually grow into Bethune-Cookman University. The life and legacy of Mary McLeod Bethune received global and historic recognition on July 13 when the influential educator and civil rights activist became the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue inside the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall.Along with sponsoring events during the statue dedication at the U.S. Capitol, Wells Fargo also funded the creation of educational materials about Bethune's life. At a reception for the statue unveiling, Bill Daley, vice chairman of Public Affairs, recognized Bethune as a ""trailblazer, educator, and civil rights hero"" who ""worked tirelessly for humanitarian and women's rights"" throughout her life.Simmons said Wells Fargo's reputation of investing in HBCUs can incentivize others to follow - both outside and inside the company.""It gives me joy and pride to be a Black woman advocating for HBCU students,"" she said. ""I am thankful that I work with an organization that allows me to show up and fight for my community. But I don't fight because it's Wells Fargo's mission, I fight because it's my community.""Wells Fargo, Wednesday, March 8, 2023, Press release pictureShemesha Burton, Virginia State University graduate and Wells Fargo business execution consultantView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargo Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742803/Helping-HBCU-Students-As-They-Become-the-Leaders-of-Tomorrow]"

To learn more about bystander intervention, visit RightToBe.org.Hate crimes in the U.S. have increased steadily in recent years, with 7,262 cases reported in 2021, per FBI data, marking the third-highest total in the last decade. Recent data suggests that crimes motivated by race, religion, gender, or other factors continued to rise in major American cities last year. New York City and San Francisco were selected as the first two locations for bystander intervention workshops due to their high number of reported hate crimes.""We can witness harassment in various forms, from covert racial microaggressions in everyday life to overt gender discrimination in the workplace. Oftentimes, we want to diffuse the situation but don't know how,"" said Emily May, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Right To Be. ""These workshops will empower the public with the skills they need to navigate instances of harassment as a bystander. Our goal is to transform bystanders into allies!""Story continuesThe events are part of a national bystander intervention initiative launched last December with the release of a series of online videos directed by Richard Lui as a volunteer on behalf of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA). A public service announcement for the program is currently airing on Comcast channels nationwide and ran in AMC movie theaters across all 50 states.""In my reporting on anti-Asian hate and attacks against Black, Latina/o/x, and LGBTQIA+ communities over the past ten years, I've seen how bystanders want to help but aren't sure how,"" said Richard Lui. ""The need to equip folks to safely intervene and de-escalate a situation is greater than ever.""""At Wells Fargo, we are committed to creating a culture with broad representation of who we are, how we think, and how we make decisions.

""As an organization that operates in many cities and neighborhoods where hate incidents have occurred, this also is a concern for Wells Fargo.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Wells Fargo (WFC) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Wells Fargo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.90, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.90 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 46.7% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WFCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WFCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Wells Fargo here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Wells Fargo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is WFC a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.81.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Wells Fargo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The EU's decision, which could pave the way for the vaccines to be introduced in the UK as well, are due in the second half of the year.Story continuesAnnaliesa Anderson, Pfizer head of vaccines research &amp; development, told the same briefing that the company anticipates a population of about 4 million pregnant women annually in the United States who could eventually receive its RSV vaccine, though the market will take time to shape.She later told Reuters that the so-called ""tripledemic"" that hit the northern hemisphere this winter may have at least temporarily raised awareness of RSV, which despite its dangers for the very old and very young is not well known by the public.""In the U.S. (this winter), the pediatric hospitals were full of babies all with RSV..., it certainly hit the news and people were much more aware,"" she said.Given how contagious the virus is, the best way to protect infants from contracting the virus and becoming severely ill is by vaccinating their mothers during pregnancy, Anderson said.GSK last year voluntarily stopped its clinical trial of its own RSV vaccine on pregnant women and is currently only pursuing the use of its vaccine on older adults, a company spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday.

The FDA is scheduled to make an approval decision on the vaccines by May, and typically follows the panel's recommendations.“We are ready to launch without capacity or supply constraints... to supply the market that we see,” Phil Dormitzer, who oversees research &amp; development for vaccines at GSK, said in an interview on Wednesday.GSK has already produced much of the vaccine components it anticipates needing for that launch, mainly at its plant in Wavre, Belgium, he added.The drugmaker published late-stage data in October showing its vaccine to be 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease in people aged 60 and over.Efficacy in patients with at least two symptoms, or otherwise assessed as having severe lower respiratory disease was 94.1%.GSK's data also showed similar efficacy in people with underlying health issues.“I think that consistency may give us an advantage,"" Dormitzer said.Pfizer's vaccine was 85.7% effective among participants with three or more symptoms, defined as severe lower respiratory tract illness, and 66.7% for two or more symptoms, according to an interim analysis of its pivotal clinical trial in the same age group.Given different definitions of the trial endpoints across the GSK and Pfizer studies, a direct comparison of efficacy is difficult.However, GSK has another possible advantage in that it has shown strong efficacy when its RSV shot is jointly administered with a flu vaccine, added Dormitzer, who joined GSK in late 2021 from Pfizer, where he helped develop and launch its COVID-19 vaccine with partner BioNTech.Story continuesPfizer has not published data on RSV/flu co-administration.GSK also sees China as an important future market for the vaccine, Dormitzer said. He cited “tremendous interest” in the company’s shingles vaccine Shingrix there.

The FDA is scheduled to make an approval decision on the vaccines by May, and typically follows the panel's recommendations.“We are ready to launch without capacity or supply constraints... to supply the market that we see,” Phil Dormitzer, who oversees R&amp;D for vaccines at GSK, said in an interview on Wednesday.GSK has already produced much of the vaccine components it anticipates needing for that launch, mainly at its plant in Wavre, Belgium, he added.The drugmaker published late-stage data in October showing its vaccine to be 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease in people aged 60 and over.GSK's data also showed similar efficacy for sub groups such as people with other health issues, Dormitzer said. “I think that consistency may give us an advantage.""Pfizer's vaccine was 85.7% effective among participants with three or more symptoms, and 66.7% for two or more symptoms, according to an interim analysis of its pivotal clinical trial in the same age group.Another possible advantage revealed in GSK's data was strong efficacy when its RSV shot is jointly administered with a flu vaccine, added Dormitzer, who joined GSK in late 2021 from Pfizer, where he helped develop and launch its COVID-19 vaccine with partner BioNTech.Pfizer has not published data on RSV/flu co-administration.Story continuesGSK also sees China as an important future market for the vaccine, Dormitzer said. He cited “tremendous interest” in the company’s shingles vaccine Shingrix there. China contributed strongly to record Shingrix sales last year of 3 billion pounds ($3.55 billion).GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in January the company is confident its RSV vaccine has ""multibillion-pound Shingrix-like annual potential.""The company has yet to apply for approval in China for the RSV vaccine but has had the country's specific requirements for entry in mind during development, Dormitzer said.GSK has applied for regulatory approval in the European Union and Japan.Competition with Pfizer's RSV vaccine could boost public awareness of the virus' disease burden, Dormitzer said, noting how the pandemic showed the importance of such education.“High efficacy is not enough for people to choose to take the vaccine,” he said.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Pfizer PFE, GSK GSK and Moderna MRNA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Long gone is the stigma of COVID. Folks are coming out from under their masks, and enjoying the pleasures of yesteryear. That means hotel stays, airfare, and theme parks. That plays right into today’s Bull of the Day. Today’s Bull is a stock that benefits from the thrill-seekers out there. With a great positive earnings trend to boot. I’m talking about Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Six Flags.Six Flags is a theme park and water park company that operates 27 locations in North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The company was founded in Texas in 1961 and is headquartered in Grand Prairie, Texas.Six Flags parks offer a variety of rides, attractions, and entertainment for all ages. Some of their most popular roller coasters include the Superman: Ride of Steel, Goliath, and Kingda Ka, which is currently the world's tallest roller coaster. In addition to rides, Six Flags parks also offer live shows, games, food and beverage options, and merchandise.Six Flags is known for its seasonal events and holiday celebrations, such as Fright Fest during Halloween and Holiday in the Park during the winter holidays. The company also offers season passes, memberships, and special events for groups and parties.Six Flags is one of the largest amusement park companies in the world and continues to expand its offerings and locations. The company has a strong commitment to safety and customer satisfaction, and is dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience for all visitors.Six Flags in the Leisure and Recreation Services industry which ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the favorable rank is that over the last week alone, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year while four have followed suit for next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from $1.92 to $2.04 while next year’s number is up from $2.27 to $2.42.Story continuesBear of the Day:There are plenty of arguments that the gold bugs make for not only the price of gold, but also companies that mine gold. The problem now is that interest rates are moving against gold. That means, there is more pressure being put on the precious metal than ever before. That is causing the earnings trends in these stocks to move in the wrong direction, to the downside. One such stock is today’s Bear of the Day. I’m talking about Equinox Gold.Equinox Gold is a Canadian-based gold mining company that operates gold mines in North and South America. The company was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia.Equinox Gold's portfolio of mining projects includes the Aurizona gold mine in Brazil, the Castle Mountain gold mine in California, the Mesquite gold mine in California, the Mercedes gold mine in Mexico, and the Greenstone gold mine project in Ontario. The company also has exploration projects in the United States, Brazil, and Ecuador.Equinox Gold focuses on sustainable and responsible mining practices, with a commitment to environmental and social responsibility. The company works closely with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that its mining operations have a positive impact on the surrounding areas.In addition to gold mining, Equinox Gold is also involved in the acquisition and development of other mining projects. The company has a strong financial position and a team of experienced mining professionals, which allows it to pursue new opportunities and expand its operations.EQX is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank is that analysts have been cutting their estimates for the current year and next year. Over the last 60 days alone, the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has gone from 12 cents to a five cent loss, while next year’s number is off from 44 cents to 11 cents.Additional content:Which Big Pharma Corp Will Clear First RSV Jab?Last week, the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), on separate days, recommended approving Pfizer’s and GSK’s respective respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines.Both companies seek FDA approval for the use of their respective vaccines to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in older adults (aged 60 years and above). With the FDA grants priority review to the regulatory filings for both vaccines, a final decision on both vaccines is expected in May 2023.While the VRBPAC voted 7-4 on both the safety and effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine, the GSK vaccine secured a unanimous recommendation from the VRBPAC on effectiveness and 10 to 2 on safety.The VRBPAC decisions are based on data from pivotal studies which evaluated these vaccines. The data supporting GSK’s vaccine showed overall vaccine efficacy of 82.6% against RSV-LRTD, while the Pfizer vaccine achieved vaccine efficacy of 85.7% against RSV-LRTD, as defined by three or more symptoms of the disease.The FDA takes the decision of its advisory committees into consideration but is not bound to follow them.If approved, either Pfizer’s or GSK’s vaccine will be the first approved RSV vaccine in the United States.Apart from Pfizer and GSK, Moderna is also evaluating its own RSV vaccine candidate. Earlier this year, Moderna announced that the FDA had granted breakthrough therapy designation to mRNA-1345, its own RSV vaccine candidate, to prevent RSV-LRTD in older adults. The decision was based on data from a late-stage study wherein participants who were administered the vaccine achieved more than 80% efficacy against RSV-LRTD. Based on these results, Moderna plans to submit for regulatory approval of mRNA-1345 in first-half 2023.Pfizer and Moderna are also evaluating their vaccine for use in other patient populations. Last month, Pfizer announced that the FDA had accepted the regulatory filing to seek expanded use of its RSV vaccine to prevent LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by actively immunizing pregnant individuals. A decision is expected later this year in August.Moderna is evaluating mRNA-1345 in an early-stage study in pediatric populations.Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines against RSV infections. Older adults are at maximum risk of getting RSV disease. The LRTD-RSV disease causes a high morbidity and mortality rate in older adults and young kids.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

388,87bb2437-b7cc-31d7-8bea-2e0b35fef8e2,FOXA,2023-03-09,Court records show political pressure behind Fox programming,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/court-records-show-political-pressure-060739408.html,1678342059,STORY,['FOXA'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — In May 2018, the nation's top Republicans needed help. So they called on the founder of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch.President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were trying to stop West Virginia Republicans from nominating Don Blankenship, who had been convicted of violating mine safety standards during a lethal accident in one of his coal mines, to challenge the state's incumbent senator, Democrat Joe Manchin.“Both Trump and McConnell are appealing for help to beat unelectable former mine owner who served time,” Murdoch wrote to executives at Fox News, according to court records released this week. “Anything during day helpful, but Sean (Hannity) and Laura (Ingraham) dumping on him hard might save the day.”Murdoch's prodding, revealed in court documents that are part of a defamation lawsuit by a voting systems company, is one example showing how Fox became actively involved in politics instead of simply reporting or offering opinions about it. The revelations pose a challenge to the credibility of the most watched cable news network in the U.S. at the outset of a new election season in which Trump is again a leading player, having declared his third run for the White House.Blankenship, who ended up losing the primary, said in an interview Wednesday that he felt the change right away, with the network's coverage taking a harsher turn in the final hours before the primary.“They were very smart about elections — they did their dumping the day before the election, so I had no time to react,” said Blankenship, who filed a separate, unsuccessful libel suit against Fox.On Wednesday, the network characterized Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit as a flagrant attack on the First Amendment and said the company had taken statements out of context. According to Fox, that included an acknowledgement by Murdoch that he shared with Jared Kushner, the head of Trump’s reelection campaign and the president’s son-in-law, an ad for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign that was to air on his network. Fox said the ad Murdoch forwarded to Kushner was already publicly available on YouTube and at least one television station.Story continues“Dominion has been caught red handed again using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on freedom of speech and freedom of the press,” Fox said in a statement.Fox has long been seen as a power in GOP politics with its large conservative fan base. But thousands of pages of documents released this week in the libel suit filed by Dominion show how the network blurred the line between journalism and party politics. Dominion sued after it became the target of 2020 election conspiracy theories, often promoted on Fox's airwaves.Murdoch also told executives at Fox News to promote the benefits of Trump's 2017 tax cut legislation and give extra attention to Republican Senate hopefuls, the documents show. He wanted the network “banging on” Biden's low-profile presidential campaign during the height of the pandemic in 2020.Nicole Hemmer, a Vanderbilt University history professor and author of the book “Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s,” said revelations in the lawsuit puncture Fox’s long argument that there is a dividing line between its news and opinion sides.“The real revelation here is how much of a fiction that division is,” Hemmer said. “Some who know Fox have argued that for awhile, but now we have real evidence.”Hemmer cited text messages disclosed in the court documents from early November 2020 sent by Fox's chief political correspondent, Bret Baier, urging the network's leaders to retract its correct election night call that President Joe Biden won Arizona. Baier advocated for putting Arizona “back in his column,” referring to Trump.In the days after the election, as Trump was making increasingly wild allegations that fraud cost him the White House, Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch, who is executive chairman of the Fox Corp., texted with Fox News chief executive officer Suzanne Scott in alarm about a Trump rally.“News guys have to be careful how they cover this rally,"" Lachlan Murdoch wrote, according to the legal documents. ""So far some of the side comments are slightly anti, and they shouldn’t be. The narrative should be this huge celebration of the president. Etc.”Some of Fox's politicking — like star host Sean Hannity's frequent conversations with Trump during his presidency — is well known. But court papers show how Rupert Murdoch, the boss, inserted himself in the action, too.Murdoch emailed Scott in November 2017 and urged her to promote Trump's tax cut proposal, which had passed the House and was nearing a Senate vote.“Once they pass this bill we must tell our viewers again and again what they will get,” Murdoch wrote in the email, included in the court records. “Terrific, I understand, for all under $150k.”After the first presidential debate in 2020, a “horrified” Murdoch told Kushner that Trump should be more restrained in the next debate. (Trump canceled that event.)""That was advice from a friend to a friend,” Murdoch said in his deposition. “It wasn't advice from Fox Corporation or in my capacity at Fox.”“What's the difference?” asked Dominion's lawyer, Justin A. Nelson.“You've been — keep asking me questions as head of Fox,” Murdoch said. “It's a different role being a friend.”Murdoch's email banter with Kushner led to the exchange of the Biden ad, according to court records. That exchange is now the subject of a complaint from the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America to the Federal Elections Commission, arguing Fox made an illegal contribution to the Trump campaign by giving it information about Biden's advertisements. Fox said the sharing of public information can't be considered a contribution.Court records show that on Sept. 25, 2020, Murdoch emailed Kushner that “my people tell me” that Biden's ads “are a lot better creatively than yours. Just passing it on.”The same month, Murdoch wondered in an email to Col Allan, the former editor of the Murdoch-owned New York Post, “how can anyone vote for Biden?” Allen responded that Biden’s “only hope is to stay in his basement and not face serious questions.”“Just made sure Fox banging on about these issues,” Murdoch responded, according to court records. “If the audience talks the theme will spread.”Another prominent politician Murdoch describes as a “friend” is McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, then Trump's transportation secretary, had served on the Fox board. Murdoch said he would speak to the Republican Senate leader “three or four times a year.”In a special 2017 Republican Senate primary in Alabama, Murdoch said in his deposition, he told his top executives that he, like McConnell, opposed Roy Moore, a controversial former Alabama chief justice. Moore ultimately won the party’s nomination but lost the general election after he was credibly accused of sexual misconduct, including pursuing relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations.Murdoch, in the deposition, also cited his personal friendship with an unnamed Senate candidate in his suggestion to Scott that the network give extra attention to Republicans in close Senate races.Days before the 2020 election, after Fox business anchor Lou Dobbs was critical of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Murdoch asked Scott to have Hannity pump up Graham, who was facing an extremely well-funded challenge from Democrat Jamie Harrison.“You probably know about the Lou Dobbs outburst against Lindsay Graham,” Murdoch wrote on Oct. 27, misspelling the senator's first name in the copy of the message in the court documents. “Could Sean say something supportive? We can’t lose the Senate if at all possible.”Scott replied that Graham was on Hannity’s show the previous night “and he got a lot of time.” She added, “I addressed the Dobbs outburst.”___This story has been updated to correct the name of Dominion's attorney, Justin A.

Chairman Rupert Murdoch said under oath that he believes the 2020 presidential election was free, fair and not stolen, according to court filings released Tuesday in a lawsuit over Fox News’ coverage of former President Donald Trump’s unfounded election fraud claims.In sworn questioning in January by lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems, Murdoch was asked, “Do you believe that the 2020 presidential election was free and fair?""“Yes,” he replied, according to a transcript.“The election was not stolen,” he said later.Dominion is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion, saying the network crippled the company’s business by broadcasting false claims from Trump’s lawyers that Dominion had changed votes in the 2020 election.Hundreds of pages of exhibits in the lawsuit, which is expected to go to trial next month, were released late Tuesday. They shed further light on internal skepticism at Fox over the fraud claims and the network's worry about viewers angry with its own election-night declaration that Democrat Joe Biden had won Arizona. Those exhibits and earlier court filings demonstrate how Fox hosts and executives continued to promote those claims to viewers, despite strong doubts and denials behind the scenes.Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump’s attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also have been roundly rejected by dozens of courts, including by judges he had appointed.Fox says Dominion is inventing its claims of lost business and has cherry-picked and misrepresented remarks by Fox hosts and leaders to paint a picture of a company that threw truth aside to keep its audience.“Dominion has been caught red-handed using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press,” the company said in a statement Tuesday, complaining that “to twist and even misattribute quotes to the highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale.”Story continuesThe documents revealed top Fox executives discussed ways of mollifying anger from Trump's team over the election call, including a quick dismissal of a Washington executive who was behind the Arizona decision.“We don't want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo. He explained in the deposition, “He had a very large following, and they were probably mostly viewers of Fox, so it would have been stupid.”In an earlier unsealed filing in the Dominion case, Murdoch acknowledged that some of the network’s hosts — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false claims. He also said he didn’t stop the commentators from promoting the false claims from Trump allies that the election was stolen, even though he could have.Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox Corp. board member, said he never believed Trump’s conspiracy theories about the election.In a Dec. 7 text to Fox executive Lachlan Murdoch, Ryan suggested that Fox broadcast a “solid pushback” against the allegations of fraud, noting that “this is a key inflection point for Fox, where the right thing and the smart business thing to do line up nicely.”The exhibits included an extraordinary three-way text conversation on Nov. 16, 2020, among the stars of Fox's prime-time lineup: Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. In the conversation, the three opinion stars complained bitterly — and profanely — that they were being hurt by Fox's news division.“We devote our lives to building an audience and they let (news anchors) Chris Wallace and Leland ... Vittert wreck it,"" Carlson said, using an expletive.“I'm disgusted at this point,” Hannity said.Ingraham said that “we should all think about how together we can force a change. The audience that exists comes for us.”Carlson, who just this week told Fox News viewers that the election that unseated Trump “was a grave betrayal of American democracy,” spoke bluntly about the former president in text messages that were revealed as part of Dominion's case.On Jan. 4, 2021, Carlson told an unidentified person he was texting with that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.” He said of the outgoing president, “I hate him passionately.”In another text exchange more than a month earlier, Carlson denigrated Trump's business abilities: “What he's good at is destroy things. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.”The pressure on Fox from its audience after its correct Arizona call was felt in Fox's news ranks, too. In a memo sent two days after the election to Bill Sammon, Fox's managing editor in Washington, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said it was getting “really uncomfortable” having to defend the decision on the air.Baier suggested that the sooner Fox changed its decision and declared Trump the winner in Arizona, “the better we are,” even if it caused the network embarrassment.Sammon replied, “It's not pride that's got us sticking to the call — it's math. I'm confident we will be proven right.”He was — and two months later Fox forced him out of his job.The exhibits released Tuesday had several references to accusations against Dominion made by Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudolph Giuliani. In one email, Fox's Dana Perino references a Powell interview with Fox's Maria Bartiromo, saying “this is nuts.” Carlson says in a text message that “Sidney Powell is lying.""An email sent Tuesday to a representative of Powell seeking comment was not immediately returned.Four days after the election, Powell forwarded an email to Bartiromo from a woman who claimed that voting irregularities in a number of states had Dominion as “one common thread.”Fox said the woman's email has been misrepresented as being a key source of Fox's reporting on Dominion.

The network said in a statement the documents show Dominion using “distortions and misinformation” to “smear Fox News and trample on free speech.”The unsealed exhibits contain evidence underlying both parties’ dueling motions for summary judgment, filed last month, in which they seek rulings in their favor to avert a trial.In one exhibit, Murdoch emailed Fox News President Suzanne Scott on Jan. 21, 2021, asking: “Is it ‘unarguable that high profile Fox voices fed the story that the election was stolen and that January 6th an important chance to have the result overturned'? Maybe Sean and Laura went too far. All very well for Sean to tell you he was in despair about Trump but what did he tell his viewers?”Story continuesIn an earlier exchange with Scott, Murdoch wrote that it had been suggested to him that the network's primetime hosts say something like ""the election is over and Joe Biden won,"" according to Tuesday's filings. Murdoch told Scott that some version of this would ""go a long way to stop the Trump myth that the election stolen.""According to Dominion’s unsealed filings, Murdoch emailed a friend that the notion state legislators could change the election outcome - an idea then gaining traction on the right - “sound ridiculous. There’d be riots like never before.”“Stupid and damaging,"" Murdoch continued, referring to a news conference by then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. ""The only one encouraging Trump and misleading him. Both increasingly mad. The real danger is what he might do as president.”These exhibits and other material included in Dominion's summary judgment motion are part of the voting machine company’s effort to prove the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove to prevail in a defamation case.Fox has said that Dominion’s “extreme” interpretation of defamation law would “stop the media in its tracks"" and chill freedom of the press.Fox’s exhibits include more context of testimony and messages that it says Dominion “cherry-picked” and “misrepresented” in its summary judgment filing.For example, Fox cites additional testimony by Fox Corp co-chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch, who said under oath that he was “concerned” but “not overly concerned” by declining ratings after the election.Dominion has alleged Fox continued to push the stolen election narrative because it was losing viewers to right-wing outlets that embraced it.In another exhibit, Fox News host Hannity - quoted by Dominion as saying he “did not believe” Trump lawyer Sidney Powell’s claims “for one second” during a deposition - went on to say that during the interview he was giving her time to produce evidence but stopped having her appear on-air after she failed to deliver.A Dominion spokesperson said in a statement that the ""emails, texts, and deposition testimony speak for themselves. We welcome all scrutiny of our evidence because it all leads to the same place - Fox knowingly spread lies causing enormous damage to an American company.”The trial, set to begin on April 17, is slated to last five weeks.

Those filings were made public in February.Dominion’s summary judgment motion cited emails and statements in which Murdoch and other top Fox executives say the claims made about Dominion on-air were false – part of the voting machine company’s effort to prove the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy.That filing included excerpts of deposition testimony by Murdoch, who acknowledged under questioning from Dominion lawyers that some Fox hosts had “endorsed” the idea that the election was stolen. Murdoch said in the deposition he believed Biden won fairly.Fox argued in court filings that its coverage of claims by Trump's lawyers were inherently newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Chairman Rupert Murdoch said under oath that he believes the 2020 presidential election was free, fair and not stolen, according to court filings released Tuesday in a lawsuit over Fox News’ coverage of former President Donald Trump’s unfounded election fraud claims.In sworn questioning in January by lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems, Murdoch was asked, “Do you believe that the 2020 presidential election was free and fair?""“Yes,” he replied, according to a transcript.“The election was not stolen,” he said later.Dominion is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion, saying the network crippled the company’s business by broadcasting false claims from Trump’s lawyers that Dominion had changed votes in the 2020 election.Hundreds of pages of exhibits in the lawsuit, which is expected to go to trial next month, were released late Tuesday. They shed further light on internal skepticism at Fox over the fraud claims and the network's worry about viewers angry with its own election-night declaration that Democrat Joe Biden had won Arizona. Those exhibits and earlier court filings demonstrate how Fox hosts and executives continued to promote those claims to viewers, despite strong doubts and denials behind the scenes.Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump’s attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also have been roundly rejected by dozens of courts, including by judges he had appointed.Fox says Dominion is inventing its claims of lost business and has cherry-picked and misrepresented remarks by Fox hosts and leaders to paint a picture of a company that threw truth aside to keep its audience.“Dominion has been caught red-handed using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press,” the company said in a statement Tuesday, complaining that “to twist and even misattribute quotes to the highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale.”Story continuesThe documents revealed top Fox executives discussed ways of mollifying anger from Trump's team over the election call, including a quick dismissal of a Washington executive who was behind the Arizona decision.“We don't want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo. He explained in the deposition, “He had a very large following, and they were probably mostly viewers of Fox, so it would have been stupid.”In an earlier unsealed filing in the Dominion case, Murdoch acknowledged that some of the network’s hosts — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false claims. He also said he didn’t stop the commentators from promoting the false claims from Trump allies that the election was stolen, even though he could have.Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox Corp. board member, said he never believed Trump’s conspiracy theories about the election.In a Dec. 7 text to Fox executive Lachlan Murdoch, Ryan suggested that Fox broadcast a “solid pushback” against the allegations of fraud, noting that “this is a key inflection point for Fox, where the right thing and the smart business thing to do line up nicely.”The exhibits included an extraordinary three-way text conversation on Nov. 16, 2020, among the stars of Fox's prime-time lineup: Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. In the conversation, the three opinion stars complained bitterly — and profanely — that they were being hurt by Fox's news division.“We devote our lives to building an audience and they let (news anchors) Chris Wallace and Leland ... Vittert wreck it,"" Carlson said, using an expletive.“I'm disgusted at this point,” Hannity said.Ingraham said that “we should all think about how together we can force a change. The audience that exists comes for us.”Carlson, who just this week told Fox News viewers that the election that unseated Trump “was a grave betrayal of American democracy,” spoke bluntly about the former president in text messages that were revealed as part of Dominion's case.On Jan. 4, 2021, Carlson told an unidentified person he was texting with that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.” He said of the outgoing president, “I hate him passionately.”In another text exchange more than a month earlier, Carlson denigrated Trump's business abilities: “What he's good at is destroy things. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.”The pressure on Fox from its audience after its correct Arizona call was felt in Fox's news ranks, too. In a memo sent two days after the election to Bill Sammon, Fox's managing editor in Washington, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said it was getting “really uncomfortable” having to defend the decision on the air.Baier suggested that the sooner Fox changed its decision and declared Trump the winner in Arizona, “the better we are,” even if it caused the network embarrassment.Sammon replied, “It's not pride that's got us sticking to the call — it's math. I'm confident we will be proven right.”He was — and two months later Fox forced him out of his job.The exhibits released Tuesday had several references to accusations against Dominion made by Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudolph Giuliani. In one email, Fox's Dana Perino references a Powell interview with Fox's Maria Bartiromo, saying “this is nuts.” Carlson says in a text message that “Sidney Powell is lying.""An email sent Tuesday to a representative of Powell seeking comment was not immediately returned.Four days after the election, Powell forwarded an email to Bartiromo from a woman who claimed that voting irregularities in a number of states had Dominion as “one common thread.”Fox said the woman's email has been misrepresented as being a key source of Fox's reporting on Dominion. Bartiromo said in her deposition that she didn't remember the email beyond forwarding it to her producer to check out.Also Tuesday, another voting tech company suing Fox News argued that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch played a leading role in airing false claims that its technology helped “steal” the 2020 presidential election from Trump.Smartmatic said the Murdochs, as the ultimate authorities at the network’s corporate parent, “directed Fox News Network to embrace disinformation following the 2020 U.S. election as a business decision.”___Associated Press writers Christina A.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.46 points to a change of +3.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +4.8% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.28 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.06 billion and $64.53 billion estimates indicate +2.5% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $16.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of 0%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.34%. The EPS surprise was -0.28%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts. Dividend zombies are companies with century-long dividend payouts, whereas dividend kings are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 50 years or more. 2022 was a difficult year from an investing point of view due to high inflation and continuous changes in monetary policies. Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&amp;P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time.Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&amp;P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7.In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some other dividend companies with long dividend growth streaks.In February, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's organic sales.At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $28.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 107 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 27International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), also known as Big Blue, is a New York-based technology company that has operations in over 175 countries.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.18 billion.Aristotle Capital Management mentioned Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

(NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based consumer goods company that deals in personal care and household products.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. PPG Industries, Inc.

(NYSE:PPG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 128 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 60Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational consumer goods company, based in New York.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) remains one of the firm’s largest equity positions. The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 132 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 66An American multinational consumer goods company, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks seventh on our list of the stocks with the longest dividend payout record.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.  Suggested articles:15 Best Small Cap Stocks Ready to Explode11 Most Profitable Pot Stocks Now11 High Growth Monthly Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

California calls it quits with Walgreens over its abortion pill stance, Yum China Holdings seizes on China's post-COVID boom, and former IBM CEO Ginni Rometty shares her personal side in her new book Good Power: Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Work, and World, which is out today. Have a great Tuesday! - The personal side. In her new book Good Power: Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Work, and World, Ginni Rometty describes arriving at IBM as an entry-level systems engineer in 1981. The company had a “buttoned-up culture,” well-known enough that Rometty purchased a navy-blue pinstripe suit before her first day.Forty-two years and one CEO job later, Rometty is on the other side of that formal culture. In her new book, published today, she shares personal stories that shaped her professional life.“I knew that if I didn't do it, it would not help people,” Rometty told me of her decision to share her personal life.""Good Power: Leading Positive Change in our Lives, Work, and World” By Ginni RomettyRometty tells readers how her father left their family when she was 16. Her mother was forced to support four kids outside of Chicago without a college degree or any work experience. Rometty took on the responsibility of caring for her younger siblings—which she says is one reason she never had children of her own. Watching her mother go back to school as an adult inspired Rometty’s support for continuing education programs and hiring employees from nontraditional career paths.She shares her experience with her weight; colleagues in the 1980s told her to lose weight, saying that her physical appearance was holding back her career. While Rometty acknowledges such a comment would be inappropriate in today’s corporate environment, she says the advice was “well-meaning.”She reflects on her mixed feelings about being the “first female” CEO of IBM, a job she held between 2012 and 2020. She tried to avoid the label for a long time but ultimately came to the same conclusion she did about IBM’s struggles to evolve from a legacy business to a modern tech company. “If I didn't define who the company was, other people would define it for me,” she remembers; the same applied to her own experience.Story continuesRometty opens the book with the story of her father leaving her family. The formative experience influenced nearly everything that followed, including the CEO’s determination to succeed and rise to the top of corporate America. As she navigated challenges as IBM’s CEO, traveling constantly, overseeing complex transactions, and attempting to turn around a struggling business, her family’s experience grounded her. “That, to me, set the bar for what bad was. No matter how bad other things got, I’d say it’s not that bad—I can keep working through this.”She hopes that people come away from her book with a new understanding of how to do hard things—with a positive impact. “You have to reveal things,” she says, “for people to learn.”Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

The outperformance can be attributed to higher oil prices that resulted in strong upstream results, which more than offset the rising pre-salt lifting costs.Recurring net income, which strips one-time items, came in at $8,163 million compared to $4,266 million a year earlier. Petrobras’ adjusted EBITDA rose to $13,903 million from $11,276 million a year ago.The company reported revenues of $30,171 million, which jumped 25.6% from the year-earlier sales of $24,031 million but came in slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30,691 million due to lower oil and gas production.In further good news for investors, Petrobras plans to pay RMB 35.8 billion or roughly $6.9 billion in total payouts.  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePetroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePetroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Quote Coming back to earnings, let's take a deeper look at the recent performances of PBR’s two main segments: Upstream (Exploration &amp; Production) and Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing).Upstream: The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s average oil and gas production during the fourth quarter reached 2,646 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) — 80% liquids — down from 2,704 MBOE/d in the same period of 2021.Compared with the year-ago quarter, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting approximately 99% of the total output — decreased 2% to 2,611 MBOE/d. The downside was blamed on divestments, decommissioning of the Marlim facilities, maintenance-related downtime, plus Petrobras’ lower working interest in the Buzios field, following a production-sharing contract.In the October-to-December period, the average sales price of oil in Brazil improved 8.3% from the year-earlier period to $83.99 per barrel. The increase in crude prices more than offset the dip in production and thereby had a positive effect on upstream unit sales. Overall, the segment’s revenues moved up to $16,973 million in the quarter under review from $15,781 million in the year-ago period.But as far as the bottom line is concerned, an uptick in pre-salt lifting costs (which rose 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2021 to $5.70 per barrel) meant that the upstream unit recorded a net income of $5,751 million, down 11.3% from fourth-quarter 2021 earnings of $6,483 million.Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing): Revenues from the segment totaled $27,542 million, up 30.9% from the year-ago figure of $21,044 million on higher fuel sales price. However, Petrobras' downstream unit came up with a profit of $1,474 million, which compared unfavorably with earnings of $1,751 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The dip was on account of lower production volume and higher unit refining cost.Story continuesCostsDuring the period, Petrobras’ sales, general and administrative expenses were $1,669 million, 19.4% higher than the year-ago period. Selling expenses also rose from $1,092 million a year ago to $1,293 million. Moreover, surging exploration costs and an impairment loss of $893 million (compared to a reverse impairment in the year-ago period) led to a $3,203 million increase in total operating expenses.The jump in costs was more than neutralized by soaring revenues, which meant that PBR reported an operating income of $11,119 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $10,322 million a year ago.Financial PositionDuring the three months ended Dec 31, 2022, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures (excluding signature bonus) totaled $2,876 million compared with $2,631 million in the prior-year quarter.Importantly, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generated a positive free cash flow for the 31st consecutive quarter, with the metric rising to $9,287 million from $7,511 million recorded in last year’s corresponding period.At the end of 2022, Petrobras had a net debt of $41,516 million, down from $47,626 million a year ago and $47,483 million as of Sep 30, 2022. The company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $7,996 million.Meanwhile, Petrobras’ net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio improved to 0.63 from 1.09 in the previous year. It also bettered 0.75 at the end of the third quarter of 2022.Some Important Q4 Energy ReleasesWhile we have discussed PBR’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s take a look at some key energy releases of the October-December period.SLB SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of 71 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. SLB recorded total revenues of $7.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%.SLB’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. The company’s board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share, indicating a 43% increase from the last paid dividend.U.S. energy powerhouse Chevron (CVX) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $4.09, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.16. The underperformance could be attributed to lower-than-expected bottom line in both the company’s segments. CVX’s upstream segment profit of $5.5 billion came 19.8% below the consensus mark, while the downstream business missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%.The company recorded $12.5 billion in cash flow from operations compared to $9.5 billion a year ago. The increasing cash flow could be attributed to strong price realizations in the upstream business. Importantly, Chevron’s free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion. Further, Chevron paid $2.7 billion in dividends and bought back $3.8 billion worth of its shares.  Refining giant Marathon Petroleum MPC reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 and compared with a profit of merely $1.30 per share in the year-ago period. MPC’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $849 million on capital programs (59% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $651 million in the year-ago period. As of Dec 31, MPC had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 billion and total debt, including $26.7 billion of MPLX, with a debt-to-capitalization of 43.9%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After the tremendous run up to $130 per barrel at the onset of the Russia - Ukraine War, prices have cooled off significantly. But it looks like the oil bull market is about to start up again.After trading in a tight range for the last three months oil prices look like they are breaking out. A rally in oil will have many significant implications. Of course, the stocks of energy companies will benefit, as with high oil prices come higher margins, but there is more to it than that. If oil prices rise significantly, it will have a strong effect on CPI and inflation.A hot inflation print, boosted by energy prices, would be very bad for policymakers and the market. It may also cause a feedback loop, where higher inflation will also increase demand for energy stocks which have acted as a haven during periods of inflation. Either way energy stocks look like a good place to be.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewValero EnergyWhenever I find a thematic trend that looks appealing, I go to the Zacks Rank to look for highly rated stock with earnings being revised higher. Valero Energy VLO fits the bill.Valero Energy is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company was founded in 1980. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the U.S., Canada, and the U.K..Valero Energy currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings have been upgraded significantly across timeframes. Over just the last 60 days, current quarter earnings have climbed 45%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVLO is trading at a very reasonable valuation. At just 6x one-year forward earnings, VLO is well below its 5-year median of 12x. Valero Energy also offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, which has increased by an average of 5% annually over the last five years.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVLO stock is off to a good start this year, already up 10%. Over the last ten years Valero stock is up 390%, 3x more than the industry average, and outperforming the broad stock index returns.Marathon PetroleumAnother way to identify good stocks is to look for relative leaders within sectors. Marathon Petroleum MPC is the best performing stock in the XLE Energy ETF. Up 12% over just the last month it has more than doubled the second-best stock in the fund.Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter, and marketer of petroleum products.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings expectations have been revised higher across timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMPC is trading at a very reasonable valuation of 7.5x one-year forward earnings, which is well below its 10-year median of 11.5x, and just above the industry average of 5.75. Marathon offers a 2.3% dividend yield, which has increased by an average of 7% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVista Oil and GasVista Oil and Gas VIST focuses on the identification, acquisition and development of oil and gas fields primarily in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.Vista Oil and Gas is one of the best performing stocks in the market, dramatically outperforming both the industry and broad market. VIST has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating an upward earnings revision trend.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrent quarter sales are expected to come in at $312 million, a 50% YoY increase. Current year sales are also expected to grow 19% to $1.4 billion. Earnings are projected to see a big boost as well, with estimates of $0.95 per share indicating a 500% increase. Current year earnings estimates are expected to climb to $4.34 per share, a 48% increase.Like the rest of the industry, VIST trades at a very fair valuation. At 4.5x one-year forward earnings it is well below the industry average of 8x, and right in line with its two-year median of 4.5x. VIST offers no dividend payouts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionIt looks like we are entering a new regime in the oil market very soon. If this breakout in oil prices has legs, it can have tremendous influence on how investors behave. I recommend keeping a close eye on oil so long as WTI trades above $80.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The security is up 69.4% year-over-year, however, after surging to a Jan. 27, all-time high of $136.46. This pullback may have created the perfect buying opportunity for investors, too, as the security is currently flashing a bull signal.MPC IntradayAccording to Schaeffer's Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, MPC's latest peak comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for the shares in the past. White's data shows seven similar signals in the past five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) stood in the 20th percentile of its annual range or lower. This is now the case with Marathon Petroleum stock's SVI of 31%, which ranks in the low 2nd percentile of its annual range.One month after these signals, MPC was higher 57% of the time to average a 4.4% pop. From its current perch, a move of comparable magnitude would place shares at a fresh record high of $137.45.While the brokerage bunch already leans bullish, there is still some room for upgrades, which could push the equity even higher.

[INAUDIBLE] looking at pop up just about 3% today. The company clearing up some confusion that had been swirling this morning about a potential activist investor looking to take over the company or take a stake in the company here. The excitement today started from a recap of an analyst note published online, the article highlighting a new risk factor in Coors's SEC filing.So Coors saying in the filing that, quote, ""shareholder activism efforts or unsolicited offers from a third party could cause a material disruption to its business."" But Don Bilson, he's an analyst there behind the initial note, telling Yahoo Finance that the note was misinterpreted. He added that the note-- in his note here that Coors is a controlled company, meaning that Coors and the Molson families, they pick about 80% of the board. Therefore, an activist takeover would be highly unlikely, Dave.- And Coors reiterating to Yahoo Finance that while there was a change to the risk factors in the filing, that doesn't actually mean there's an active risk or potential sale on the table. A Molson Coors spokesperson telling us via email, quote, ""we routinely review our risk factors for updating in our SEC filings. There's nothing specific to call out other than that the risk language was prompted by the SEC's new universal proxy rules to which every public company is subject.""Coors shares giving back, as we said, some of their gains. They were up 5% at one point. But, Seana, that's still a pretty significant gain at nearly 3%, which leads one to believe that investors aren't entirely dismissing the notion of some buyer flying around. That's based on no other news. There is no other news related to Molson Coors. No upgrade. So a nearly 3% gain certainly indicates that investors see something on the horizon. The beer market is certainly not the reason for the excitement.Story continues- Yeah. Maybe investors got a little bit too hopeful here in terms of what a potential takeover, what that would potentially do with Molson Coors's business because when you take a look at even just the six-month chart, we're looking at a gain of just over 4% over the past year, pretty much equivalent there. Over the past five years, we're down about 32%.So I think investors are looking for any sort of way that Molson Coors could potentially boost its business there. Obviously, some of the pressure, some of the challenges that Molson Coors is up against, many of its competitors in this space also facing the same headwinds there. But investors are a little bit too optimistic, I think, about that initial report.- $11 billion market cap. Certainly attainable. Not to add fuel to the speculation fire, but I just did.]"

""We argued that Tesla can take market share at a gross margin of c25% (excluding credits), which indeed is where we see investor expectations heading for 2024.""Shares of the EV maker fell more than 1% in pre-market trading.The downgrade comes on the heels of a mixed week or so of news for Tesla, as Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports. Tesla's overhyped investor day underwhelmed the masses as it didn't unveil a speculated cheaper new model. Then, the company cut prices again to stoke demand — this time on the high-end Model X and Model S. Early Wednesday morning, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also announced a probe into the Model Y related to a potential steering-wheel issue.To that end, Yanoshik's Tesla downgrade makes a couple of key points for investors to consider:#1: Tesla's Valuation Isn't CheapTesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&amp;P 500, as investors bake in above-market growth rates for the EV beast.But with interest rates headed higher and competition from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) rising, Tesla's valuation leaves little room for error operationally, Yanoshik pointed out.""Valuation now leaves less room for disappointment,"" Yanoshik says.#2: There Is No $25,000 Tesla YetInvestors have been clamoring for a cheaper ""Model 2"" from Tesla under the $30,000 price point. Musk has teased Tesla is working on it, but acknowledges it will take time as it tries to bring down battery and other production costs further.Story continuesYanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline on when a cheaper Tesla will arrive and start contributing to profits.""New vehicle segment may boost market size by 75% but likely to take time: Moving into a smaller vehicle segment would open up a significant volume opportunity. It could expand Tesla’s total addressable market (TAM) by [$1 trillion excluding credits], which is 75% larger based on our forecast of market size in 2026. We model a slow rollout in the segment, however, not breaking through a 1 million vehicle delivery run-rate (roughly our 2023E Model Y volume) until 2028,"" Yanoshik notes.The call for patience from Tesla on the cheap car front is something echoed by JP Morgan auto analyst Adam Jonas.""From our experience, auto companies don't typically unveil far cheaper and potential better engineered products far in advance of SOP. Imagine you just placed an order for a $50k Model Y and Tesla tells you there will be a slightly smaller version for ½ the price with enhanced capabilities available soon. … From a commercial standpoint, maybe not the best strategy,"" Jonas said in a recent note.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.53 per share, indicating a change of -26.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.21 points to a change of -18.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.99 indicates a change of -3.6% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $38.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.1%. The $161.68 billion and $162.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $43.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.19%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The lawsuit has been filed on concerns that the merger, on taking effect, will be anti-competitive.The lawsuit alleges that the $3.8-billion deal, on materialization, will lead to higher fares and reduced number of seats, resulting in an unfavorable scenario for passengers travelling on the flights. JetBlue had plans to remove 10-15% of seats from every Spirit plane, per the complaint. Per U.S. senator, Elizabeth Warren, ""Americans want more choices and lower prices for airline tickets, not another giant merger.""The roadblock pertaining to the impending merger comes at a time when the U.S. airlines are struggling from high labor and fuel costs. A merger is looked at as a way aimed at saving costs. Making matters worse as far as the future of the deal is concerned, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is supporting the lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice.We remind investors that both JetBlue and Spirit filed a transfer application with the USDOT asking for permission to combine and operate their international routes under one certificate. SAVE and JBLU had also filed an exemption application requesting the USDOT to permit them to operate under common ownership before the requested transfer. The USDOT is likely to block the transfer of SAVE’s airline certificate.However, JBLU’s management put forward the argument that the takeover of Spirit Airlines would result in a market share of 9% for the former and allow it to better compete with the leading U.S. airlines like American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL. Given this back drop, it will be interesting to wait and see the future course of action regarding the deal.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, both Spirit Airlines and JetBlue carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may consider stocks like American Airlines and United Airlines, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Alaska Air Group (ALK). ALK is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.02. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.84. Over the past 52 weeks, ALK's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.28 and as low as 7.32, with a median of 8.87.ALK is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.41. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ALK's industry currently sports an average PEG of 0.44. Over the last 12 months, ALK's PEG has been as high as 0.48 and as low as 0.41, with a median of 0.43.Investors should also recognize that ALK has a P/B ratio of 1.59. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 3.27. ALK's P/B has been as high as 2.04 and as low as 1.29, with a median of 1.54, over the past year.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Transportation - Airline value stock, take a look at United Airlines (UAL). UAL is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.United Airlines also has a P/B ratio of 2.48 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.27. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 4.68, as low as 1.76, with a median of 2.93.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Alaska Air Group and United Airlines are likely being undervalued right now.

438,9d1ea9cb-ebd5-3229-8103-d340a076ac4c,UAL,2023-03-09,"Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copa-holdings-cpa-soars-52-141502150.html,1678284902,STORY,"['CPA', 'UAL']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Copa Holdings (CPA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $97.24 in the previous session. Copa Holdings has gained 14.9% since the start of the year compared to the 7.9% move for the Zacks Transportation sector and the 16.6% return for the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 15, 2023, Copa Holdings reported EPS of $4.49 versus consensus estimate of $4.09 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.77%.For the current fiscal year, Copa Holdings is expected to post earnings of $11.55 per share on $3.36 billion in revenues. This represents a 39.83% change in EPS on a 13.17% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.17 per share on $3.45 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.38% and 2.69%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCopa Holdings may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Copa Holdings has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 8.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 12.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 16.5X versus its peer group's average of 9.5X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Copa Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Copa Holdings passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Copa Holdings shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does CPA Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of CPA have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL). UAL has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.Earnings were strong last quarter. United Airlines Holdings Inc beat our consensus estimate by 18.84%, and for the current fiscal year, UAL is expected to post earnings of $8.30 per share on revenue of $52.79 billion.Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc have gained 6.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 6.51X and a P/CF of 5.13X.The Transportation - Airline industry is in the top 18% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CPA and UAL, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, Alaska Air Group Inc. ALK and JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Industry Likely to Revive Lost Glory in 2023The global airlines industry is set to revive its lost glory in 2023. The industry suffered a massive hit from early 2020 to mid-2022, due to pandemic-induced travel restrictions and lockdowns. However, as the United States and most countries globally removed air travel restrictions buoyed by the gradual fading out of coronavirus infections, the airline industry is gaining its foothold.The pent-up demand is driving traffic for airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes, there is a wave of optimism surrounding air-travel demand. The buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand is expected to improve further in 2023.IATA's Bullish ForecastIn December 2022, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that the net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023. The top line in 2023 is anticipated at $779 billion compared with the previous estimate of $727 billion.Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 [pre-coronavirus] levels) despite economic uncertainties. Cargo revenues are expected to be around $150 billion, suggesting an increase of nearly $48.6 billion from the pre-pandemic level of 2019.Positive DevelopmentsMajor airlines like American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings results with strong guidance for the near term. Improved air travel demand was the primary reasons for the upbeat guidance.Story continuesAlaska Air Group Inc. too is being aided by buoyant air-travel-demand. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing. ALK expects first-quarter 2023 total revenues to increase 29-32% year over year.JetBlue Airways Corp. has partnered CHOOOSE to create a new online platform, which allows passengers to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights. To stop these harmful emissions, passengers can make financial contributions to fund the usage of environmentally-friendly sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on JetBlue flights.Owing to its environmentally-friendly attitude, AAL has improved its fuel efficiency by more than 10% since 2013, in turn saving 1.9 billion gallons of fuel and preventing 19 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. AAL used 2 million gallons of SAF in 2022, thereby doubling its usage year over year.Moreover, the airline industry suffered last year due to higher crude oil prices that were triggered primarily by the prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine. However, oil prices, the major source of costs for airlines, retreated by nearly 30% from the March-April peak of last year.Finally, China’s recent reopening and removal of all travel-related restrictions after a long COVID-19 lockdowns will benefit the airline industry. The resilient demand will allow several debt-ridden companies to fix their balance sheets.Bottom LineAir-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines' top lines. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is an added positive. The well-being of companies in this industry is linked to the health of the overall economy.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NYSE:PNC) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last month. In contrast the stock is up over the last three years. However, it's unlikely many shareholders are elated with the share price gain of 43% over that time, given the rising market.Although PNC Financial Services Group has shed US$3.8b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).PNC Financial Services Group was able to grow its EPS at 14% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 13% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, PNC Financial Services Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that PNC Financial Services Group shareholders are down 19% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.9%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.6%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.PNC Financial Services Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

To sign up for this newsletter, please click here.On Tuesday, Target (NYSE:TGT) boss Brian Cornell warned of “a very challenging environment” in consumer demand, sending shares down 6%.The following day, shares of Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) sank 7% after posting similarly dire warnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn other words, this week saw a continuation of the “downbeat retail CEO parade.”In my years as a consumer-goods analyst, I’ve found that demand patterns always propagate within sectors. Middle-class shoppers trading down to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) invariably hurt firms like Target and Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS). Profits at Walmart, in turn, get compressed by these deal-seeking shoppers who refuse to buy high-margin items.And it’s why I warned investors last Sunday in this space to avoid retailer stocks until after earnings season. InvestorPlace.com readers have clearly felt the same way, with some of our most popular articles this week focusing on “crash-related” stocks.Read on for more on that… and for the latest on the best buys in artificial intelligence…1. Some Investors Are Bracing for a Crash…This week, the No. 1 story at InvestorPlace.com, our free stock market news and analysis site, was straight to the point:7 Stocks That Just Have No Hope LeftThe piece by Louis Navellier and his staff outlined seven marginal companies teetering on the edge. Some like business outsourcing firm Exela Technologies (NASDAQ:XELA) are already skipping interest payments, suggesting it will soon enter Ch. 11 bankruptcy. Others like hypergrowth Chinese electric vehicle firm Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) are getting squeezed by price wars.It’s a clear sign that investors are nervous about growth stocks, and they aren’t waiting around for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to save the day.Story continuesWe’re seeing the same fear spill over into the housing market… tech stocks… bonds… anything that could go belly-up in a downturn.InvestorPlace.com’s second-most popular article this week, Housing Market Crash Alert: Mark Your Calendars for Feb. 28, warned about declining prices in the real estate market. And on Thursday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) sank 7% after CEO Elon Musk failed to wow his audience in this company’s Investor Day. (As for bonds, the 30-year Treasury hit 4% for the first time since November this week.)Why This Matters: InvestorPlace.com readers, and investors everywhere, are nervous about an economic crash… which could mean more selling to come.2. … While Others Are Gambling for FunOn the other hand, risk-seeking traders continue to pursue the “meme stock” market… and we continue to see that interest pop up on InvestorPlace.com.On Tuesday, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) saw wild swings in its share price after the theater chain announced better-than-expected Q4 earnings. An initial 5% spike would turn into a 20% rout as traders cashed out of a massive number of call options.And Troika Media (NASDAQ:TRKA), a popular new stock, is already up another 35% since I called it a potential 10-bagger last Tuesday at InvestorPlace.com.Our readers also are looking further afield for deep-value stocks. The site’s other popular articles this week included:7 Penny Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade3 Deeply Undervalued Growth Stocks Due to Double7 Super Speculative Stocks That Could Make You Very RichWhy This Matters: The bifurcated market tells us it’s still too early to bet against individual stocks, even if they’re heading to zero. Not only are day traders ignoring the Fed. They’re doubling down on the riskiest of bets.3. SPACs Are Melting DownThen there are the so-called special purpose acquisition companies (almost universally known as SPACs), a class of stocks that’s trading in a world of their own. These “blank check” companies were briefly popular in 2021 after taking several high-profile startups public, and then began to fade from view in 2022.Shares of SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition (NASDAQ:HUBC) nosedived this week after finalizing its merger with Israel’s HUB Cyber Security on Wednesday. Shares now trade at $1.80, down from its pre-merger $10.The same day, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) notice revealed that Digital World Acquisition (NASDAQ:DWAC) — the SPAC behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social – could get delisted from the Nasdaq exchange for non-payment of fees. (Trump has called the investigation “egregious conduct and blatant politicization.”)DWAC shares now trade at around $14, down 85% from its 52-week high.These stumbles represent a broader pattern of SPACs in recent months. Over a half-dozen of these reverse-merger firms have already declared bankruptcy, despite raising billions from investors. And around 73 mergers have now lost at least 90% of their initial valuation, according to data from Bloomberg.Growth and meme investors alike seem unsure what to do next. It’s been an enormous destruction of wealth. But for value investors, it’s turning into a hidden gift…Why This Matters: Lower SPAC valuations mean that value investors have a buffet of low-cost choices. And one of these is featured in Luke Lango and Eric Fry’s AI Super Summit –in which they decode the massive new opportunity that’s emerging in artificial intelligence. That brand-new video event is running now… check it out here.4. Earnings Season Winds DownNext week will feature slightly fewer big-name earnings reports. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will close out tech, Sea (NYSE:SE) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) with e-commerce, and Brazilian giant Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (NYSE:PBR) in energy. (Some stragglers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) will report the week after.)It will be a welcome break for our news-weary readers.Still, I expect InvestorPlace.com fans will want to watch CrowdStrike. On Thursday, fellow cybersecurity firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) jumped 10% after earnings topped estimates, joining other companies like Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) in double-digit gains.CRWD’s beaten-down stock could follow suit.There is, of course, a chance that markets will punish CrowdStrike’s stock anyway. Enterprise spending has slowed in recent months, and investors have become hypersensitive to guidance revolving around that.For example, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) tumbled 11% on Friday on these very concerns, despite beating estimates. And that makes straddles on CrowdStrike’s stock a winning play. Expect volatility ahead. And keep an eye on InvestorPlace.com for news and analysis on those reports.5. Investor Interest in AI ShiftsFinally, this week finally saw investors give a big, fat yawn to several major AI announcements.Shares of Snapchat owner Snap (NYSE:SNAP) have traded sideways since its AI chatbot announcement on Tuesday. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has done little better on news that the social media firm is revamping its AI team.Our InvestorPlace.com readers also have shown diminished interest in such attention-seeking firms.Why This Matters: The rapid reversal means that some high-quality AI plays are now trading at enormous discounts to February’s valuations. And in this week’s AI Super Summit, Luke and Eric highlight one of these high-potential stocks that could soar 1,000% or more.Conclusion: The Tale of Two Markets ContinuesLast week, The Wall Street Journal called the current market a “richcession,” a downturn that specifically affects the better-off. Indeed, incomes for the top-two quintiles of earners have lagged since 2019, and the layoffs we’re seeing reported every day are mostly targeting well-paid white-collar workers.The effect is also making itself clear in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average — an index of blue-chip American stocks — is down 1.2% since January. Meanwhile, the riskier Nasdaq-100 is up 9.5% over the same period.There are companies that have benefited from this pivot from quality to growth. Louis Navellier’s longtime favorite Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 60% this year alone as conservative and speculative investors alike search for greener pastures.Now, Luke and Eric are adding their own picks to the mix. And at this week’s AI Super Summit, they started to show investors how to find the best AI stocks to buy now.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 86% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-110055411.html,1678273255.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Intuitive Surgical's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 21 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Intuitive Surgical does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Intuitive Surgical is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.1% and 6.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$385m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuitive Surgical. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Companies involved in artificial intelligence are at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry. Indeed, these companies are revolutionizing many sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing.Notably, since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, investors have taken on a renewed interest.AI is one of the fastest-growing industries, and the demand for AI products and services is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. AI has the potential to disrupt traditional industries and create new markets and opportunities for businesses that adopt it early. Additionally, AI stocks can help diversify an investor’s portfolio, reducing their overall risk exposure. Thus, there’s plenty of potential reasons to invest in the sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three of the best options in this space right now, in my view.MSFTMicrosoft$255.29ISRGIntuitive Surgical$234.87RTXRaytheon$99.02Microsoft (MSFT)microsoft stockSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has invested heavily in research and development when it comes to artificial intelligence. The company’s cloud computing platform, Azure, offers a range of AI and machine learning tools, including cognitive services, Bot Service, and Azure Machine Learning. The early integration of AI technology across the company makes Microsoft a top player in the AI industry.However, Microsoft has recently garnered plenty of headlines as the company added ChatGPT to its Bing search engine. Microsoft hopes that ChatGPT will bring new relevance to its search engine, weakening Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) dominance over search.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is backed by Microsoft, who has poured billions into the project.

This technology is still in its beta form, but there’s plenty of potential – that much is clear.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a medical technology company that has pioneered the development of robotic-assisted surgical systems. The da Vinci Surgical System uses AI algorithms to enhance surgical precision, accuracy, and safety. The system has been widely adopted by hospitals and surgical centers worldwide. That strong position suggests that as AI technology advances, Intuitive Surgical is well-positioned to maintain its leadership.Intuitive Surgical is at the intersection of several big questions. Can its products, combined with advancing AI technology, improve the delivery and quality of care? Will AI lead to better patient outcomes?Current evidence seems to suggest that the answer could be yes. The machine learning and AI in Intuitive Surgical’s products improve outcomes across various procedures. For example, robotic surgery to repair damaged bowel tissue between 2010 and 2019 resulted in lower mortality, reoperations, bleeding, and readmission rates than traditional surgery.Raytheon (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon (NYSE:RTX) is a well-known defense company investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning with a well-developed platform. One of its subsidiaries, Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space, offers a range of AI-powered solutions for defense and intelligence applications. It will face stiff competition among leading defense firms focused on automated target recognition, predictive maintenance, and autonomous systems. That said, I think Raytheon could come out ahead in this race.Raytheon’s AI and machine learning programs span cybersecurity, space, weather, national security, and intelligence sectors. These programs assist in crunching data that informs action plans for key decision makers.Additionally, Raytheon has been developing programs to leverage AI when human reaction speed is limited. For example, Raytheon has been developing systems that can identify and respond to surprise attacks on ships that would leave humans too little time to react.Raytheon has also funded multiple partnerships with universities to develop AI and machine learning capabilities, among other efforts. Raytheon, like all significant defense companies, has been heavily involved with AI and machine learning efforts for a long time. Expect these defense firms, with their substantial budgets, to continue to be able to attract the best and the brightest talent in the industry. The military will continue to push the limits of technology to benefit national security, and AI will be no exception.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It is the leader among Class I railroads with the fewest train accidents and the lowest average rate of Federal Railroad Administration injuries since 2019. At the same time, CSX has established itself as the industry leader in service performance metrics, affirming that network fluidity and safety go hand in hand.CSX’s rise as the industry’s safety and service leader has been driven by multiple factors, including:Investments in technology and infrastructureCSX has consistently increased its annual investment on core infrastructure and will spend $1.7 billion out of a total $2.3 billion capital budget on track, bridge and signal projects in 2023. Over the five-year period from 2017 through 2021, the company spent $500 million more on core infrastructure than in the previous five-year period and has continued to increase spending each year.CSX has already updated several hot bearing detectors (HBDs) across its rail network with connectivity to facilitate remote monitoring. The company has also over the past three years been updating the HBDs to second-generation technology that is more effective in detecting overheated rail car wheel bearings, and consistently inspects the units every two weeks to ensure optimal performance. The HBDs are deployed every 15.1 miles along key routes and 16.2 miles along all CSX routes. The company is proactively preparing to install 53 additional detectors over the course of 2023, extending coverage to ensure that HBDs are in place every 14.3 miles along its key routes and 14.9 miles along all CSX routes.CSX has been updating its acoustic bearing detectors (ABDs) over the past several years to second-generation technology to assist with safety inspections. The railroad currently has nine units in place and is in the process of installing 12 additional ABDs, which analyze the acoustic signature inside the bearing to help identify potential issues.CSX has installed three automated train inspection portals (TIPs) on high-volume main lines to perform 360-degree inspections on moving trains using high-resolution imaging technology and advanced image analysis. TIPs are able to detect defects as the train is in motion.CSX uses autonomous track assessment cars (ATACs) to gather critical data on track conditions and send the data in near real-time for assessment and, if necessary, expedited track repair. ATACs are constantly travelling in trains across the entire network.CSX has an extensive drone safety program that uses unmanned aerial vehicles to perform a wide range of tasks, including aerial mapping of yards, facility inspection, storm response, accident investigation and law enforcement.Story continuesGrowing the workforce and improving quality of life for train crewsCSX has successfully conducted a recruitment and hiring campaign for train crew members. Last year, the company hired more than 2,000 conductors and continues to onboard new employees to meet increasing demand for rail services.CSX led the industry in implementing several changes to improve quality of life for operations employees, including updated attendance policies that are more flexible and agreements with rail labor unions on paid sick leave.Safety-focused policies and practicesCSX uses an industry-leading best practice for monitoring the condition of hot bearings and is actively participating with other major carriers in sharing best practices on standards for tracking and analyzing trends in bearing condition. CSX established its best-in-class method of analysis in 2007, and has continually honed the approach over time. The practice has helped the railroad significantly reduce incidents. CSX incurred only one minor bearing-related incident in 2022.CSX utilizes advanced risk assessment technology annually to determine the shortest and safest routes to transport goods categorized as hazardous.CSX holds hazardous materials training events for first responders, contractors and local government officials. In 2022, the company conducted 40 training events attended by more than 3,600 individuals.CSX will participate in the FRA Confidential Close Call Reporting System and already has multiple well-established company initiatives to encourage safe behaviors and reporting of safety issues. The programs offer various options for submitting information to make it convenient for employees, including email, voicemail and web forms.As CSX continues to prioritize the safe transport of critical freight across the nation, the company is committed to maintaining its focus on proactively taking measures to protect its employees, communities and customers.About CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Analog Devices (ADI) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this semiconductor maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Analog Devices is 11.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.7%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Analog Devices is 99%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 38.8%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Analog Devices have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 9.5% over the past month.Bottom LineAnalog Devices has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Analog Devices is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Analog Devices and M/A-Com are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ADI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ADI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.44, while MTSI has a forward P/E of 23.04. We also note that ADI has a PEG ratio of 1.42. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MTSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.36.Another notable valuation metric for ADI is its P/B ratio of 2.57. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MTSI has a P/B of 5.78.These metrics, and several others, help ADI earn a Value grade of B, while MTSI has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesADI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MTSI, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ADI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: ADI), a global semiconductor leader, today announced that Envision Energy, the subsidiary of Envision Group providing world-leading green technology, is adopting ADI's MEMS sensor technology in the company’s new generation of smart wind turbines. Initial goals for the collaboration include enabling new levels of wind turbine safety through enhanced real-time monitoring of vibration, tilt, and other information that can be used to inform safer windmill operation and design. Leveraging new capabilities offered by advanced MEMS sensors adds intelligence at the edge for real-time monitoring, further advancing the green energy revolution.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230308005050/en/Envision Energy leverages MEMS sensor technology by Analog Devices to build smarter and safer wind turbines. (Graphic: Business Wire)As one of the most mature renewable energy sources, wind power has achieved rapid growth in China in recent years. According to China’s National Energy Administration, by the end of 2022, the cumulative installed capacity of wind power in China reached approximately 370 million kilowatts, ranking first in the world. With the gradual expansion of wind power scale, wind turbine components are undergoing rapid iteration. Higher tower barrels, longer blades, and heavier engine rooms bring great challenges for the safe and reliable operation of wind power systems.Among the challenges, the tower barrel is one of the key windmill components requiring monitoring to ensure the safety and reliability of wind power turbines. The tower barrel extends from the ground up to the windmill generator and blades. To promote safety, as well as to help prevent tower collapse and other extreme accidents, Envision Energy joins forces with ADI to introduce predictive maintenance technology into the core control of smart wind turbines. This is done by deploying ADI’s precision inertial measurement unit (IMU) and low-noise, low-drift accelerometers on different positions of the tower barrel to monitor the key states of tower barrel in real-time. Information gathered by monitoring tower barrel conditions is used to inform danger prevention measures.Story continues""In the long-term, wind power and energy storage will become the energy of the future for the world. While we move toward that goal, safety remains the first factor in the process of value mining,"" said Haipeng Chen, Director of Intelligent Control Division at Envision Energy. ""We are pleased to work with ADI to add its predictive, precision, high-reliability MEMS sensors to our wind turbines. This increases the safety of the tower barrel as well as brings the blade diameter and tower barrel height to the next level, continuing to lead the progress of the industry.""""ADI has decades of experience in the field of MEMS sensors,"" said Neil Zhao, Director of MEMS Technology Group Asia at ADI. ""We are committed to helping customers solve challenges in different scenarios through high-performance solutions and all-around support.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Mad Money Stock Picks This Week.All indicators show that the Federal Reserve is ready to continue raising interest rates as it has more than enough reasons to stick to its hawkish stance. Bloomberg in a March 5 report said the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates “several more times to quell stubborn inflation.”The Bloomberg report quoted Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who recently talked to reporters and said the following:“I want to be completely clear: There is a case to be made that we need to go higher. Jobs have come in stronger than we expected. Inflation is remaining stubborn at elevated levels. Consumer spending is strong. Labor markets remain quite tight.”The Federal Reserve’s resolve to control inflation and increase rates was more than clear when it recently submitted its semi-annual report to Congress. The Federal Reserve said that it remains “strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.”""Let Them Get Slaughtered in their Bonds""Jim Cramer recently gave his comments on the latest market situation in an episode of his “Mad Money” program on CNBC. Cramer said that the weakness in the market is “all anecdotal” right now. However, Cramer specifically said that those who believe rates are peaking right now are “too bullish.”Cramer further said:“Let them get slaughtered in their bonds.”Cramer said that the market needs to see more soft data showing that the economic activity, wages and inflation are cooling before we get to see a real rally in the stock market.Jim Cramer has time and again reiterated in his latest programs that history is not a guide in the current market environment as he’s been seeing a lot of unprecedented market and consumer behaviors recently. For example, while inflation remains stubborn and we keep reading reports of how the consumer is getting hammered, consistent data shows that the demand in the travel and tourism sector remains strong. Despite inflation, consumers are continuing to spend on hotels and flights. Cramer said that despite rising vacation prices and expensive hotels, people are spending on travel probably because they believe life is too short or what Cramer referred to as the “YOLO (You Only Live Once”) trend. Cramer said the Federal Reserve cannot make sense of these distortions.Story continues""Nothing Makes Sense""Jim Cramer believes there are too many “distortions” in the market right now and “nothing makes sense.” Cramer thinks the “discrepancies” at the moment are “too difficult to fathom.”""Nothing in this economy is working like it’s supposed to. Nothing is predictable, and history is a terrible guide right now because we’ve never been in this situation before.”Despite all of this, people are still interested in knowing what Jim Cramer has to say about US equities and to know which stocks Cramer believes should be piled into. Some notable stocks Jim Cramer has been talking about in his latest programs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Our MethodologyFor this article, we watched several episodes of the Mad Money program of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked the most notable stocks Cramer was recommending in late February and early March.Mad Money Stock Picks This Week10. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40A caller recently asked Jim Cramer about his previous call about Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) and why the stock still hasn’t been able to cross the $20 market and instead sitting at around $16. Cramer promptly said that “I’ve been wrong” because of the price of gold not because “Barrick is bad.” Cramer said that Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is a “good company” and he continues to recommend the stock.In February, Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) posted its Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $0.13, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the quarter fell about 16.3% on a YoY basis to reach $2.77 billion, missing estimates by $20 million.A total of 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had reported owning stakes in Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) as of the end of the last quarter of 2022.Old West Management made the following comment about Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is the second largest gold miner in the world, with operations in the U.S., Canada, Africa, South America and more. Barrick is also a major copper producer. Former Goldman Sachs executive John Thornton took control of the company in 2012 and quickly realized he wanted someone with a mining background to run the company. Mark Bristow, at that time CEO of Randgold, was considered one of the best gold mining executives in the world. Thornton wanted Bristow so badly Barrick bought Randgold in 2018. Bristow who is South African, had extensive experience operating mines throughout Africa, and in fact would fly his own single engine plane to visit mines. He has his PhD in Geology, and he has flourished running Barrick the past five years.Barrick is estimated to have $1.6 billion of net income this year on $11.5 billion of revenue. Net Income has been growing 15% per year. The stock trades at $19.00 per share which is 16 times forward earnings, and the stock has a 3.15% dividend yield. Barrick has a fortress balance sheet with $5.7 billion in cash and $5 billion of long term debt, which is only one time EBITDA”9. Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Jim Cramer said in a program earlier this month that Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) is doing “really well” and he likes the stock. Cramer also likes Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)’s restructuring. Like CAH, Jim Cramer is also bullish on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Recently, Baird upgraded Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) to Outperform from Neutral after the company raised its 2023 profit guidance following strong Q4 results.Baird’s analyst Eric Coldwell said in a note to investors that Cardinal Health, Inc.

(NYSE:CAH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, distributor of pharmaceutical and medical products Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH) advanced in the period as leadership changes were viewed to be a positive for shares. Management provided a new profit outlook for Fiscal 2023 and announced an improvement plan for the medical segment. We are encouraged by these changes and think CAH’s underlying fundamentals and competitive advantages around preventative maintenance screenings and medication management will continue to improve. We believe valuations of health care companies like CAH that focus on cost optimization and promote technological efficiency across the supply chain will be rewarded over the long term.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Jim Cramer earlier this month praised Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and said that he likes the stock. Cramer likes Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)’s at-home COVID testing and anti-diabetes products.Earlier in March, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) said the FDA has cleared its FreeStyle Libre 2 and FreeStyle Libre 3 integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system sensors for integration with automated insulin delivery (AID) systems.In February, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 1.91%. The dividend is payable on March 15 to shareholders of record as of April 14.At the end of the last quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). The total value of these stakes was about $3.2 billion.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons. The plant has resumed production, and Abbott is regaining lost market share. We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”7. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the most notable stocks Jim Cramer likes in the tech universe.Jim Cramer recently said in his program that he likes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and that the company is a leader in “many things” including AI.Recently, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) acquired Morphus, a privately held Brazil-based cybersecurity company.Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) also announced recently that Accenture Federal Services, a subsidiary of the company, won a 10-year, $900 million Air Force digital engineering contract.In January, MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis said in a note that companies like Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and IBM are well-positioned in digital transformation.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 63 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). The net worth of these hedge funds’ stakes was $2.9 billion. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) during this period was Guardian Capital’s GuardCap Asset Management which owns a $387 million stake in the company.ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a leading global professional services company that helps clients build their digital infrastructure and optimize their operations. We view Accenture as a resilient, high-quality business with consistent earnings and cash flow, a strong balance sheet and very attractive returns on capital. Secular drivers like cloud migration and digital transformation, as well as new, innovative technology deployments like data security, block chain, AI and machine learning position Accenture well for continued growth. It is also currently rolling out a suite of sustainability tools that offers a comprehensive view of a company’s goals, progress and performance across financial and ESG measures, so it is an enabler of ESG for its clients. We exited our position in software-as-a-service company Workday to fund the position, largely on better relative risk/reward, in our view.”6. Analog Devices, Inc.

Her parents were educators, and she was an exceptional student.Regions Bank, Wednesday, March 8, 2023, Press release pictureYet despite an ""extremely exhilarating childhood,"" she was aware at a very early age that the Jim Crow laws of the South, enforcing segregation, made her different. It meant she was not permitted to go to the Paramount Theater and was allowed only to sit in the Black section on the city bus - behind demarcation signs that read ""Whites"" and ""Colored.""She was just eight years old when the Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights occurred, and she remembered how she and her brother ""stole away"" to hear Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak. One by one, those early experiences made a deep impression on her, ultimately influencing her decision to go to law school.""It became clear to me that I was going to improve life, if at all, one person at a time,"" McPherson said.Regions Bank's celebration of Black History Month culminated in a true grand finale Monday evening, by recognizing McPherson's commitment.During its annual History in Motion program, the bank honored McPherson for her lifetime of service defending civil rights, upholding justice for all and cultivating knowledge and understanding throughout her community.In private law practice, McPherson specialized in the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and represented many clients in employment discrimination cases based on race.She was sworn in as the first Black Federal Magistrate Judge in Alabama in 1992 and served 14 years on the bench.But her service to the community hasn't been limited to the legal system. She and best friend and fellow judge, Delores Boyd, opened a bookstore to help address the lack of available African-American literature in retail bookstores and local libraries.McPherson also served as a widely acclaimed columnist for the Montgomery Advertiser, where she provided political, racial and social commentary.Story continuesHer voice outside the courtroom has been just as influential as it was when upholding civil rights legislation. McPherson has used journalism as a platform to be a beacon for her community, in addressing issues that are critical to our society.""She gets righteously indignant about all forms of racism,"" Boyd said. ""She is fearless in speaking out.""Because she witnessed first-hand many significant events and milestones in history, McPherson acknowledges how important it is to make sure young people - especially young African Americans - understand ""what happened, why it happened and what difference it makes.""""I'm very proud of having lived through the time I lived through,"" she said. ""I am proud that I have served as a private practitioner and a judge. I'm proud that I can look around me and see the difference I have made.""See and hear more of Judge McPherson's inspiring story in the video above.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bank Email: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742796/One-Person-at-a-Time]"
476,76be91e6-a523-3dd0-a5c7-fdbff5ca34f8,RF,2023-03-09,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-141002046.html,1678284602,STORY,['RF-PC'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last. People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Axis Capital (AXS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.44 per share, with a dividend yield of 3%. This compares to the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's yield of 0.61% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.69%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 4.76%. Check Axis Capital (AXS) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) is paying out a dividend of $0.23 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.05% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.61% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 4.76% over the past year. Check Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.2 per share, Regions Financial (RF) has a dividend yield of 3.57%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.05% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 17.65%. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

479,8fe19365-ee8f-38cd-ba94-69f6bd464523,V,2023-03-09,Possible bearish signals as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) insiders disposed of US$9.2m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-visa-inc-130040890.html,1678280440,STORY,['V'],"[The fact that multiple Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Technology, Rajat Taneja, for US$5.4m worth of shares, at about US$217 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$223, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.1% of Rajat Taneja's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Visa than they bought, over the last year. They sold for an average price of about US$217. It's not too encouraging to see that insiders have sold at below the current price. Since insiders sell for many reasons, we wouldn't put too much weight on it. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Visa better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Story continuesDoes Visa Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$243m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Visa Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Visa, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFiserv’s valuation multiples don’t appear stretched, with the current 16.1X forward earnings multiple sitting well beneath the 22.5X five-year median and the Zacks Business Services sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s hard to ignore the company’s growth trajectory, with estimates suggesting 12.6% year-over-year earnings growth in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 14% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted year-over-year revenue upticks of 6% in FY23 and 9% in FY24. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on an annual basis.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaA multinational financial services company and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Visa facilitates electronic funds transfers through Visa-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards.Visa posted a strong quarter in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 8% and reporting revenue 3.4% above expectations.The market was certainly pleased with the results, sending shares on an upward trajectory. This is illustrated by the green arrow in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Visa shares provide an income stream; V’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, a tick below the Zacks Business Services sector average.Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by more than 15% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd for the cherry on top, Visa is a cash-generating machine; V reported free cash flow of $3.9 billion in its latest release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStryker Corp.Stryker is a medical device company operating in the global orthopedic market. Like the stocks above, SYK sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares got a big boost following Stryker’s latest quarterly release. The company posted earnings of $3.00 per share, nearly 6% above expectations.Quarterly revenue totaled $5.2 billion, 5% ahead of estimates and growing 10.7% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to V, Stryker shares pay a dividend, currently yielding 1.1% annually. While the yield is below the Zacks Medical sector average, SYK’s 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith an upcoming jobs report and investors digesting Powell’s testimony, it’s reasonable to expect a heightened level of volatility throughout the week.In uncertain times, low-beta stocks, including Fiserv FISV, Visa V, and Stryker SYK, can help shield investors from spooky price swings.In addition to being low-beta, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating an optimistic near-term outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Increasingly, society has become aware of gross inequities in the sociological and environmental realms. Therefore, it might cost enterprises to ignore ESG initiatives altogether.Some of this narrative comes down to pure math and lifecycle realities. As various research firms pointed out, younger generations consistently hold more liberal views than their preceding generations. Further, the age cohort that staunchly supports conservative views eventually expires, to use clinical language. Thus, the rise and eventual dominance of progressivism bolsters high-growth ESG stocks. Increasingly, then, those that insist on going against increasingly mainstream views may suffer fiscal consequences.

However, we shouldn’t forget that on balance, Home Depot strives to serve the benefit of its communities. For instance, as an essential business, Home Depot stores stayed open quite late during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. Personally, I’m grateful for its accommodations.On the financial side, it’s difficult not to feel good about HD stock. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), HD rates as a modestly undervalued investment. Further, the investment resource’s analysis of the company’s discounted cash flow (DCF) reveals that its fair value should be $474.50 a share. Presently, shares trade hands below $300.Story continuesWhile HD might have a boring reputation, Wall Street analysts peg it a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $333.29, implying almost 14% upside potential. Therefore, it’s one of the solid high-growth ESG stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs I’ve remarked plenty of times now, software stalwart Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fits into several investment categories. Here, it’s absolutely no stranger to high-growth ESG stocks to buy. Under Microsoft’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiative, it features several commitments to environmental sustainability. Perhaps most notably, it aims to be carbon negative by 2030. Further, by 2050, it will remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975.Moreover, Microsoft will be water positive by 2030. This means it will replenish more water than the company uses. In that same year, Microsoft will be a zero-waste enterprise across its direct waste footprint. Not surprisingly, Microsoft features many strengths. Aside from its robust balance sheet, the company kills it operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 17.4% while its net margin pings at a blisteringly high 33%. Both stats rate into the top echelon of the underlying industry.Finally, analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $292.07, implying over 16% upside potential.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comA financial services giant, Visa (NYSE:V) carries a worldwide reputation for issuing its branded credit cards. Under its ESG initiative, Visa implements robust security networks to protect its customers from cyberattacks. In addition, the company features an empowerment project, seeking to buttress small and micro businesses (SMBs). Under this program, Visa especially focuses on women’s economic advancement and racial equity.That’s not all. Visa also has committed to carbon neutrality goals. Specifically, it aims to be a net-zero emissions enterprise by 2040. As well, it’s taking strong steps to incorporate renewable energy exclusively.What investors will appreciate about V being one of the high-growth ESG stocks is that it’s not just talking about “paper” initiatives. On the financials, Visa delivers the goods, especially in the operational realm. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 10.7% and a net margin of 50.3% rate in the upper half of the underlying industry. Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg V as a consensus strong buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $260.81, implying 19% upside potential.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comA manufacturer of popular household items, Unilever (NYSE:UL) really made a name for itself as one of the high-growth ESG stocks to buy. During the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, the pandemic brought to light several issues of inequity. In response, Unilever forwarded several initiatives aimed at empowerment.In addition, the company takes great pride in its environmental sustainability initiatives. For one thing, management committed to a clear pathway for zero emissions in Unilever’s operations by 2030. Further, it aims to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2039. Moreover, the company is transitioning to renewable energy across its operations. This includes finding new low-carbon ingredients and expanding its plant-based product range.As well, Unilever offers a solid enterprise. Conspicuously, it enjoys a strong balance sheet unencumbered with debt. It also features a net margin of 12.74%, outpacing nearly 86% of the competition. Lastly, Argus Research pegs UL as a buy. Its price target is $60, implying 19% upside potential.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA major pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) primarily earned its reputation for forwarding innovative medical solutions. However, it’s also a company that seeks to profit from doing the right thing. Perhaps most notably, Eli Lilly offers insulin at $35 or less per month. Its website notes that the company helped 1.5 million people through patient support programs for Lilly medicines.As with the other high-growth ESG stocks on this list, the pharmaceutical firm is committed to various environmental goals. Among them, it seeks to be carbon neutral in its own operations by 2030. As well, it aims to use 100% renewably sourced electricity. To be fair, investors may need some patience with LLY as it might be overvalued. However, the company features incredible profitability. For instance, its operating margin of 29% and a net margin of nearly 22% outpace at least 90% of the competition.Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg LLY as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $388.86, implying over 23% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockWith all the talk about renewable electricity, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) makes an organic case for high-growth ESG stocks to buy. Operating wind turbines and solar energy facilities, NextEra represents a major player in sustainability initiatives. Notably, management committed to its zero-carbon blueprint goal of eliminating carbon emissions no later than 2045.Further, in 2021, NextEra noted that it received an ESG evaluation score of 86 from S&amp;P Global Ratings. It stressed that this was one of the highest rankings to be given by the agency. In fairness, recent troubling events stripped some positive momentum off NEE, with shares down a bit over 8% in the trailing year.However, this could be a temporary setback. Looking at its financials, NextEra benefits from strong profitability metrics. Specifically, its net margin pings at 19.79%, outpacing 85.47% of sector rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $95.45, implying over 32% upside potential.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAs a member of big tech, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) naturally generates controversy – it comes with the territory. However, perhaps not enough credit goes toward GOOG legitimately ranking among the high-growth ESG stocks to buy. Similar to other ESG-focused enterprises, Alphabet’s Google seeks to be carbon-free by 2030.As well, Google spearheads various social equity initiatives. For instance, the company seeks to improve leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30% by 2025. As well, the tech giant will focus on improving the diversity of its value chain. For instance, it aims to spend $100 million on Black-owned businesses. Finally, Google invests considerable funds to foster gender equity in the tech workspace.Notably, Gurufocus.com’s DCF analysis reveals that GOOG is considerably undervalued. In addition, the company features solid growth and dominating profitability margins. Finally, covering analysts peg GOOG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $123.78, implying 34% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for KLA The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.66bUS$2.53bUS$3.09bUS$3.90bUS$4.21bUS$4.44bUS$4.64bUS$4.82bUS$4.98bUS$5.12bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.56%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.9% US$3.3kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.9%– 2.1%) = US$66bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$66b÷ ( 1 + 9.9%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$50b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$375, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at KLA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.326. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for KLAStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

(VZ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-attracting-140002063.html,1678284002,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has lost 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 points to a change of -8.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of +1.7% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $138.14 billion and $139.92 billion estimates indicate +1% and +1.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $35.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was -0.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

490,3fe85549-14e8-3669-849c-289a3f9737c3,VZ,2023-03-09,Verizon continues to upgrade El Paso's best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-el-pasos-140000218.html,1678284000,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show customers in El Paso have the best experience on Verizon’s networkEL PASO, Texas, March 08, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Customers in El Paso, Texas have an unbeatable experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of the major wireless carriers throughout El Paso, Verizon is unsurpassed for overall network performance, and is unbeaten in every single category measured including accessibility, speed, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show remarkable speeds for Verizon customers in El Paso with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 142% in the market since last year*.“We know customers count on us, and we work everyday to ensure we deliver for them,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “We will not slow down. In fact, our team in El Paso has been driving enhancements in the network at a record pace to ensure customers in this community have the network experience they expect from Verizon.”Network enhancements in El Paso, TXThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the El Paso area. Network engineers have been busy deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout El Paso, with 5G service added to over 140 cell sites throughout the community. 100 of those cell sites are providing 5G Ultra Wideband using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. These sites primarily cover the El Paso Downtown and the Eastside Business districts where customer data usage is extremely high. Other enhancements improved network service in the areas of the El Paso Community College-Valle Verde Campus and the El Paso Country Club in west El Paso.Much of this 5G service is using Verizon’s newly acquired C-band spectrum. Until this year in El Paso, Verizon has been restricted to using 60 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in El Paso will be able to take advantage of 100 MHz of C-band, almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Story continues“Think of it this way, we are adding more lanes onto an already incredibly wide and fast highway,” said French. “The more lanes, the more cars can get on and off the interstate and the faster they can drive. In the same way, the more spectrum we open up on our network, the more data can move across our network faster and more efficiently.”One key element that differentiates Verizon’s service for their customers is their ownership and use of fiber connections to cell sites. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the El Paso area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. These upgrades will continue throughout this year.“With 5G, people are doing more things in more places with their wireless devices, and we now see Verizon Home Internet customers, who are using the same network infrastructure, using more data as well,” said French. “We’ve exponentially increased the capacity on our cell sites with all the C-band and mmWave spectrum we’re using in the market, but we don’t want the fiber connections to our cell sites to be a bottleneck that could slow the pace of data traffic moving around our network. That’s why we have increased those pipes as well.”Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in El Paso, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more. Plans start at just $25 per month with AutoPay and a select 5G mobile plan – all without extra fees, equipment charges, annual contracts or data caps.** Go to verizon.com/home for availability.

In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Greenville, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in the categories of accessibility, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show steady speeds for Verizon customers in Greenville with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 21% in the market and Verizon’s median upload speeds increasing by 11% since last year*. This is the fifth consecutive testing period in a row Verizon has been unbeaten in the Upstate.“Whether our customers are enjoying connecting with friends and family while on the move, connecting their smart homes through one of our home internet products or using our service in Greenville for small business or enterprise applications, we know customers count on us,” said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team has been working hard in Greenville to deliver these results, and we are not slowing down.”Network enhancements in GreenvilleThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the Upstate. Network engineers have deployed new macro cell sites which are providing coverage and capacity to customers in downtown Pickens SC and the area immediately East of downtown Pickens, West of Seneca SC around the Hwy 123 and Hwy 28 intersection, and the Southern part of Lake Greenwood and Hwy 34 between Chappells SC and Ninety Six SC.Network engineers have been busy deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service using Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum, designed to provide wide coverage for 5G service. Nearly three hundred cell sites throughout the upstate are now upgraded with this new technology, providing 5G service to more than one million Upstate residents. Verizon has been deploying this service using 60 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Greenville will be able to take advantage of additional bandwidth, almost doubling and in some cases tripling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Story continuesIn addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Verizon has recently added 35 5G Ultra Wideband small cell sites using mmWave spectrum, primarily covering downtown Greenville.Clemson fans have more to cheer about because later this year, Verizon engineers plan to add additional 5G service using C-band spectrum at Clemson Memorial Stadium and Littlejohn Coliseum.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Greenville, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

Ferraro; CFO; Synchronoss Technologies, Inc.Michael James Latimore; MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst; Northland Capital Markets, Research DivisionMichael Joshua Nichols; Senior Analyst of Discovery Group; B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research DivisionPresentationOperatorGood afternoon. Welcome to Synchronoss Technologies Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Synchronoss Technologies' President and CEO, Jeff Miller; and CFO, Lou Ferraro. (Operator Instructions) Then before we conclude, I'll provide the necessary cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during this call. I would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded and made available for replay via a link to the Investor Relations section of the company's website at synchronoss.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Synchronoss' CEO, Jeff Miller. Sir, you may proceed.Jeffrey George MillerThank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. After the market closed, we issued a press release announcing our results for fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And I encourage all listeners to view our release for additional information on what we'll be discussing today. I'll start with a review of our recent updates and highlights before turning it over to Lou to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. After that, we'll open the call for questions. Our continued focus on growing our core Cloud business and managing our cost structure resulted in further improvements in profitability and cash flow in the fourth quarter, enabling us to meet our bottom line goals for the year. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, including headwinds with lower mobile handset purchase activity and subscriber activations, we grew subscribers by a double-digit rate for the 11th consecutive quarter, and more significantly, we increased our Invoiced Cloud revenue by 9.5% in Q4 and more than 8% for the full year. Clearly, the momentum of our Cloud business remains strong. Our cash generation capabilities are materializing and growing, and we continue to deliver innovative and profitable solutions to our global base of customers. Our performance throughout 2022 has set the stage for us to continue to scale our high-margin Cloud business and attain our goal of generating positive cash flow in 2023. And as we look forward to 2024, the combination of anticipated Cloud subscriber growth, matched with the conclusion of certain nonrecurring payment obligations, positions us to ramp cash growth significantly further in 2024. I'll now provide further updates with the 3 product groups. Beginning with our core business, we experienced another solid operational quarter in Cloud. In the quarter, we finalized a major Cloud agreement with another Tier 1 global operator that we expect to launch in the second half of 2023. And it's forecasted to deliver more than $50 million over the term of the relationship. We also previously shared that in Q4, AT&amp;T chose to exercise a 1-year extension option on its existing agreement, which now runs through the end of 2023. There were no changes to the commercial terms and AT&amp;T continues to leverage its Personal Cloud to further engage with its customers. As part of the extension, AT&amp;T is expanding its marketing and distribution to leverage their retail channels with additional education and sales incentives, highlighting the capabilities of the AT&amp;T Personal Cloud. We are anticipating a long-term renewal agreement with AT&amp;T to be executed this year. In November, we announced that we'd be adopting Verizon's private storage infrastructure to manage all digital content for Verizon customers using the Synchronoss Personal Cloud Platform. On one hand, this consolidation allows Verizon Cloud subscribers to more efficiently store photos, videos and other digital files managed by the Synchronoss Cloud. And for us, consolidating the storage will enable our team to focus on developing new features and functionality while simultaneously eliminating the investment into hosting petabytes of storage infrastructure going forward. Aside from content storage, Synchronoss will continue hosting many key aspects of the Verizon Cloud offering, including access control, authentication and customer life cycle management. We've also made continued progress on our 3 strategic Cloud priorities which are, number one, to protect and grow subscribers; number two, expand our global customer base; and three, deliver anchor features. Beginning with our first priority. Progress with existing customers has continued, with subscriber growth maintaining its strong pace, as I mentioned earlier, improving 14% year-over-year in Q4. Despite the global economic headwinds and challenging competitive dynamics in the mobile industry, we continue to deliver double-digit subscriber growth through increased collaboration with our 2 largest customers, AT&amp;T and Verizon. Moving to priority #2, global customer expansion. As I mentioned earlier, the highlight of the quarter was the December signing of a milestone agreement with a global Tier 1 operator, which is forecasted to deliver more than $50 million over the life of the multiyear contract. The customer is a leading provider of mobile, telecommunications and ISP services, and we've begun work with them to launch the Synchronoss Personal Cloud to their tens of millions of subscribers, with the launch expected in the second half of this year. This event underscores a critical step in our goal towards global cloud expansion. Our recent attendance at the Mobile World Congress industry event was encouraging as well where we witnessed a return of over 100,000 attendees. In meetings with dozens of customers and prospects, it is evident that service providers across Europe, Asia and North America continue to prioritize ARPU growth and profitability. And they're viewing value-added services such as the Synchronoss Cloud as essential pieces to the equation for generating new revenue with the added benefit of reducing customer churn. We're beginning 2023 with a strong pipeline of additional Cloud opportunities that reflect the relevance of our revenue generated value-added services, building further upon this recent Tier 1 win. Moving to the enhancements to our Cloud feature capabilities. We made significant updates to our platform in Q4 further cementing our leadership position as the #1 in white-label cloud. At the beginning of this year, we unveiled the next-generation Personal Cloud platform at CES in Las Vegas. Our Cloud solution, which now supports over 9 million subscribers worldwide, includes several features and functionality that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance user engagement and to ensure data privacy and security. The enhanced platform also adds capabilities to better share files and optimize photos. During MWC in Barcelona, artificial intelligence was one of the major industry themes. The emerging fascination with generative AI is something that we anticipated and have already applied to the updated Cloud offering. In Q4, we debuted Genius, which is just one element of Synchronoss' robust AI capabilities. The Genius algorithms use deep learning modules for photo optimization. The first set of benefits allows users to enhance images, color black-and-white photos or perform touch-ups on faces in captured pictures. Advanced Highlights, another new capability, exemplifies our leveraging of machine learning to improve subscriber engagement. This capability allows our Cloud Platform to present and share compelling user content through curated presentation of flashbacks of the moments that mean most to them. We also introduced Private Folder. Personal Cloud Private Folder includes a pin-protected place to safely store valuable user content, such as important photos or personal documents. This capability enables users to take advantage of edge detection to easily and accurately scan and upload documents and other information to the secure folder. Additionally, part of the updated platform capabilities is Backtrack, a feature that allows users to restore files for their versions from previous days. This feature has many uses, such as recovering from a virus, ransomware or other malware that infected a user's files or protecting access to files that may get accidentally corrupted or lost. Our product updates were highlighted in our Synchronous-hosted Explore virtual event earlier this year, and I encourage those of you on the call today to replay that, which is available in our Investor Relations website. In summary, we're continuing to position our high-margin Cloud business for growth among new and existing customers. Our cutting-edge technology is trusted by the largest operators in the world and we're committed to continue to innovate and advancing our position as the leader in white-label cloud. In the Messaging business, we saw positive developments with customers in Europe and the Asia Pacific markets. The quarter was highlighted by a milestone among the Japanese consortium of mobile operators as they reached 32.5 million subscribers for the Plus Message cross-operator RCS service, which is powered by the Synchronoss Advanced Messaging platform. The mark represented a 62% increase in subscribers since November 2020. This is a great momentum for RCS in Japan, and we're continuing to work to provide innovative solutions that enable new ways to connect, engage, collaborate and transact business. Additionally, we announced the extension of a long-standing relationship with a major global service provider in the APAC region as we now help them support over 50 million e-mail service users with the Synchronoss Email Suite and the Mx9 core messaging platform. This milestone not only demonstrates the level of commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction but also the scalability of our solutions and the strength of our technological capabilities. The extension comes on the heels of several other wins. Also in the fourth quarter, we migrated 13.5 million subscribers from a leading telco operator in Italy to the latest version of the Synchronoss Email Suite. This new environment has been enhanced with the latest features such as anti-spam, antivirus and IP reputation capabilities. At the end of Q3, we also announced a 3-year Synchronoss Email Suite extension with FastWeb, a leading Italian telecommunications operator. These customers in Italy have each been partnered with Synchronoss for over 2 decades, demonstrating the long-term value provided by our Messaging platform. In summary, Messaging continues to support our broad set of global customers and to complement our core Cloud business while providing financial stability, profitability and positive cash flow. Finishing in Digital, we signed new contracts and rebranded the portfolio of products, introducing the networkX monitor. The new brand identity more closely aligns our focused value proposition for telecom service providers to increase the utilization of network infrastructure assets and services while reducing their costs. For the purposes of this quarter, all networkX business is being referred to by its legacy digital distinction. Beginning in 2023, our financial reporting will be updated to reflect the new networkX naming conventions. As we also noted during our latest update, in November, we signed a multiyear agreement with Consolidated Communications to utilize the ConnectNX platform. As a reminder, ConnectNX is the newest evolution of our iNOW products, and it is the industry's only wholesale solution that enables partners to conduct business on a blockchain distributed ledger. Consolidated Communications has been using it to manage order fulfillment and network ticketing processes as well as to deliver simplified customer experience. Going forward, we expect our remaining digital business to drive a steady revenue stream and healthy profitability for the company. In summary, the momentum of our Cloud business remains strong. Our cash generation capabilities are materializing and growing, and we're continuing to deliver innovative solutions to an expanding set of global customers. As we move through 2023, we are accentuating the strong profit and growth profile of Cloud while continuing to drive free cash flow improvements through disciplined cost management efforts. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lou to discuss our financial results for the quarter and year in greater detail. Lou?Story continuesLouis W. FerraroThank you, Jeff. Our fourth quarter free cash flow performance resulted from the combination of solid Cloud growth over the past year and our continued prudent cost management efforts. We achieved free cash flow of $1.4 million and adjusted free cash flow of $4.2 million, increases of $8.1 million and $10.6 million, respectively, from the prior year period. As noted previously, we are still experiencing macroeconomic conditions that are slowing the pace of customer decision-making, which had a moderate impact on our top line results during the period. Additional contributors to financial performance in the quarter came from $5.9 million in revenue recognized in Q4 2021 from the sale and product sunsetting of the nonstrategic DXP and Activation assets earlier in 2022 and expected $3.6 million runoff in Cloud deferred revenue and a $1.2 million unfavorable revenue impact from foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by Cloud subscriber growth. Despite these headwinds, the operating improvements made throughout 2022 still resulted in a $20.3 million increase in operating income for the year, thanks to a nearly $50 million reduction in total cost and expenses. Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of our key performance indicators, which serve as the leading success metrics for our business. First is the solid year-over-year Cloud subscriber growth of 14%, continuing our trend of double-digit growth for the 11th consecutive quarter. Looking at revenue by product, Cloud revenue of $39.8 million was down 12% on a year-over-year basis as a result of expected deferred revenue runoff as well as the sunsetting of the Mobile Content Transfer product, the functionality of which is now built into the Cloud product platform. Cloud revenue represented 65% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 61% in the same period of 2021 and up slightly from 64% in Q3. Digital revenue of $8.1 million was down 46% on a year-over-year basis due to the sale and product sunsetting of the nonstrategic DXP and Activation asset sale in Q2 and made up 13% of total revenue in the quarter. Messaging revenue of $13.7 million made up 22% of revenue and remained approximately flat from 2021. Quarterly recurring revenue was 81.6% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, comparatively flat from Q3. And annual recovery in revenue was 84.3% in 2022, also comparatively flat from 2021. Invoiced Cloud revenue increased 9.5% year-over-year to $41.4 million and grew 8.3% for the full year 2022 to $152 million from $140.9 million in the prior year. This non-GAAP metric is intended to provide greater transparency in underlying revenue trends within our Cloud business. Invoice revenue represents the cash revenue earned in period and is a direct reflection of the overall health and trajectory of the business. Invoiced Cloud revenue was not impacted by changes in deferred and unbilled revenue and more accurately illustrates the growth of our core Cloud business. We expect continued growth of Invoiced Cloud revenue in future quarters, driving improvements in cash flow as subscribers grow and new customers come online. Turning now to our financial results in the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022. Total revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 17% to $61.6 million from $73.8 million in the prior year period. Looking at the full year, total revenue decreased 10% to $252.6 million from $280.6 million in 2021. The decline in revenue for the quarter and year was a result of expected impact from the sale of product sunsetting of the nonstrategic DXP and Activation assets earlier in '22, the expected runoff in Cloud deferred revenue, unfavorable revenue impact from foreign exchange and the temporary slowdown in purchasing activity as a result of macroeconomic conditions. Also of note, in the first half of the year of 2021, we recorded $11.3 million of revenue related to the termination of the CCMI joint venture, which was a major contributor to the year-over-year decline. Lastly, a good portion of our revenues come from operating in international markets. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to other global currencies, notably the Japanese yen and the euro, had a quantifiable impact on our results. During the fourth quarter, the negative impact to revenue was approximately $1.2 million compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2022, the impact from FX was a negative impact of approximately $5.1 million. Gross profit in Q4 decreased 17% to $32.2 million or 52.3% of total revenue from $38.8 million or 52.5% of total revenue in the prior year period. For the full year, gross profit increased 5% to $131 million or 52.1% of total revenue from $139.1 million or 49.6% of total revenue in 2021. The decrease in gross profit for the quarter and year was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned changes in deferred revenue, the sunsetting of the Mobile Content Transfer product and the sale of the company's DXP and Activation assets. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased revenue from high-margin Cloud subscriber growth and benefits from cost management efforts, which have resulted in ongoing lower operating expenses. Fourth quarter loss from operations was $3.5 million compared to income of $4.6 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was a result of the revenue change slightly offset by greater efficiency of R&amp;D resources and other cost management efforts. For the full year, income from operations was $1.3 million compared to a loss of $19 million in 2021. The increase in operating income for the year was a result of an increased portion of high-margin Cloud revenue as well as reduced SG&amp;A expenses and greater efficiency of R&amp;D resources throughout the year. Net loss in Q4 was $15.9 million or $0.18 per share compared to a net loss of $2.1 million or $0.02 per share in the prior year period. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue of $12.2 million; an increase in SG&amp;A, primarily as a result of the change in the contingent consideration of $3.6 million; an increase in commissions directly related to the Tier 1 Cloud contract signed in Q4 mentioned by Jeff; an increase in other expenses related to noncash foreign exchange from reevaluation of intercompany trade receivables, which was partially offset by continued expense management. For the full year, net loss was $17.5 million or $0.20 per share compared to a net loss of $58.5 million or $0.90 per share in 2021. The significant improvement in net loss was a result of operational improvements made throughout 2022 that resulted in nearly $50 million in annual reduction in total cost and expenses, which have substantially streamlined our overall operating cost profile going forward. In Q4, adjusted EBITDA decreased 41% to $10.9 million or 17.7% of total revenue from $18.3 million or 24.8% of total revenue in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to the change in revenues, as previously outlined, partially offset by expense management. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA decreased 3% to $48.1 million or 19% of total revenue from $49.4 million or 17.6% of total revenue in 2021. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was partially attributable to the favorable change in revenue mix towards high-margin Cloud subscriber growth and ongoing benefits from cost management efforts previously noted, which will continue as we enter 2023. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA resulted from the change in revenue, as previously outlined, albeit at a lower nominal rate than the change in revenue. Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $21.9 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $22.6 million at September 30, 2022, and $31.5 million at December 31, 2021. Free cash flow was $1.4 million and adjusted free cash flow was $4.2 million. Additionally, Synchronoss has yet to draw upon the accounts receivable securitization facility we entered in the second quarter of 2022, and we do not anticipate needing to utilize it. Further, we believe that our current cash position and expected improvements in cash generation in the coming quarters, we do not have any need to raise additional capital for the foreseeable future. As a reminder, approximately $28 million of tax refund claims are still included on the balance sheet within our prepaid assets. The company did not receive any additional tax refunds during the period. The remaining tax refunds remain under audit. We are responding to the IRS data request in a timely manner, and the audit is progressing. It is difficult for us to estimate the time when the audit will be concluded. It is our intention to use the remaining tax refunds to pay down preferred shares when they are received. Now let me move on to guidance. Based on the continued strong performance within our core Cloud business as well as improvements in operational expense management, we are reiterating our expectation to be cash flow positive on an unadjusted basis for 2023. We currently expect to generate cash flow in the single-digit millions for the full year. Additionally, after factoring in anticipated Cloud revenue growth, along with the expiration of certain existing nonrecurring payment obligations and other costs, we expect cash flow generation to significantly improve in 2024. We also expect Cloud subscriber growth to continue at a double-digit rate on a year-over-year basis in 2023.Moving to GAAP revenue. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we expect revenue to range between $242 million and $255 million. The comparable 2022 pro forma GAAP revenue is $240.4 million after adjusting for the deferred revenue runoff and $4.8 million in revenue recognized prior to the sale of the DXP and Activation assets. The net contribution to GAAP revenue from noncash deferred revenue is expected to be $7.4 million less in '23 than it was in 2022, most of which is related to the first half of the year. As a result of these factors, revenue in the first and second quarters of '23 is expected to decline moderately year-over-year on a GAAP basis. After this time, the majority of the impact from deferred revenue and divestitures is expected to be realized. As a result, we expect to return to total revenue growth on a GAAP basis for the second half of the year and in 2024. Finally, we expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $44 million and $55 million in 2023. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Josh Nichols from B. Riley.Michael Joshua NicholsA question, just looking at the 4Q revenue, could you provide a little bit more color? It looks like it came in near the bottom of the range. I'm just kind of curious what the puts and takes were between the top and bottom end of the range and how that played out relative to the company's expectations, specifically on the cloud business and how that will translate to revenue in 1Q relative to where we came off in 4Q.Jeffrey George MillerYes. Great question, Josh. So revenue for Q4, in particular, was again impacted negatively by foreign exchange, as mentioned by over $1 million in the quarter. We also did see some delays in customer decision-making. But candidly, that was mostly outside the Cloud arena. We found a very healthy Cloud performance by virtue, and what you saw in the results, with Invoiced Cloud revenue growing 9.5% in the quarter. We were quite pleased with that and feel that, that bodes well for what we're going to expect to see as we continue in 2023. I don't know, Lou, if you want to add to that?Louis W. FerraroThe decision-making, Josh, that we saw that was delayed was not a matter of many companies that were looking at license sales, primarily in our messaging and digital business saying that they were not going to purchase the products, but more that they were pushing out those decisions into 2023.Michael Joshua NicholsAnd then just the trajectory sequentially for the first quarter relative to the 4Q and what's kind of baked into that outlook.Louis W. FerraroJosh, could you repeat that, Q1 '23?Michael Joshua NicholsYes, Q1 '23 relative to 4Q and just what's kind of baked into the outlook. I assume that's going to be down a little bit sequentially before returning to growth in the second half?Louis W. FerraroYes. It will be down slightly, Josh, in Q1 and Q2. And then we expect that, that will turn around in Q3 and Q4. In Q1 and Q2, that will be slightly impacted by these macroeconomic decision-making efforts, which we're trying to be conservative about that. However, our Cloud growth, we think, will continue to remain strong, with that double-digit subscriber growth being the main catalyst for that.Michael Joshua NicholsAnd then I think the last question for me, probably one of the bigger points to focus, is the company had a nice transition to positive free cash flow generation here. It seems like you're on track. Is the expectation that you're going to be able to maintain and increase this level of free cash flow generation? Or is there going to be much changes to it as we think about the cadence of that cash flow generation in '23 given the continued cloud subscriber growth that we've been seeing?Louis W. FerraroI think what you'll see, Josh, is we always usually have our normal periodic dip with some annual recurring payments in Q1 that tend to impact cash flow. We then usually tend to stabilize that over the last few years in Q2 and have that growth continue in Q3 and Q4. I think we'll see a very similar trajectory in 2023.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland.Michael James LatimoreAll right. Great. Just in terms of the revenue guidance range for the year, how should we think about the variables that kind of gets you to the low end versus the upper end of that range?Jeffrey George MillerYes. First off, obviously, in each of the circumstances, on a pro forma basis, it represents growth over what we achieved in 2022. And then what we expect within that range from $242 million to $255 million will be based on the continued pace or maybe accelerated pace of subscriber growth. That will be a large driver. And then key decision-making for license purchases throughout the year, both in our Messaging and our Digital portfolio. Those will help define kind of where we fit within that range as we finish out the year.Michael James LatimoreGreat. And did you say that you expect growth in all 3 businesses? Is that what you said?Jeffrey George MillerNo, I would represent full expectations that you're going to see growth in our business in Cloud, for sure. And we expect generally flat performance across the messaging and the digital portfolio, depending on where we land in that range.Michael James LatimoreOkay. Got it. And then in terms of the first half, I think you still have the comp against the DXP business. How much of a year-over-year effect will the DXP sale have in the first half?Jeffrey George MillerThat's about $4.8 million. And then in addition to that, as you heard from Lou's comments, the other year-over-year comp will be about $7.5 million worth of deferred revenue runoff that will have been in the prior Q1 and Q2 for 2022.Michael James LatimoreSure. And then just on the move to the Verizon Private Cloud Storage, I think that should help your gross margin. But can you quantify that a little bit, how much that might help your gross margin?Jeffrey George MillerYes. We're right now moving and almost completed all of the transition actually into that object storage from Verizon and we do expect that it is going to have a favorable influence on our total margin picture. In dollar terms, probably [$6 million to $8 million] worth of improvement in our cost structure to improve overall gross margin for the Cloud business, which is just another tailwind in an already profitable business.Operator(Operator Instructions) And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Jeff Miller, CEO, for any further remarks.Jeffrey George MillerGreat. Thank you. I'd like to acknowledge the continued dedication of the entire Synchronoss team, evident through the contributions made throughout 2022.

For those of you joining us today, we appreciate your continued interest in our company. And to our investors, thank you for your continued support. We look forward to meeting with many of you over the course of the next day or weeks to come. Operator, thank you very much.OperatorBefore we conclude today's call, I would like to provide Synchronoss' safe harbor statement that includes important cautions regarding forward-looking statements made during this call. During this call, management discussed certain factors that are likely to influence the company's business going forward. Any factors that are discussed today that are not historical, particularly comments regarding our prospectives, market opportunities, should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws. These forward-looking statements include comments about the company's plans and executions (sic) [expectations] of future performance. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and which could cause actual results to differ materially. All listeners are encouraged to review the company's SEC filings, including the most recent 10-K and 10-Q for all description of these risks. Statements made during this call are made as of today, and the company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes to expectations or otherwise. Please note that throughout today's call, management discussed certain non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA. Although the non-GAAP measures are defined from GAAP numbers, adjusted EBITDA does not necessarily equate to cash generated by operations as it does not account for such items as deferred revenue or the capitalization of software development. Today's earnings release describes the difference between the company's non-GAAP and GAAP reporting and presents a reconciliation for the periods reported in the release. Thank you all for joining for today's Synchronoss Technologies' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.]"

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Tamara Erwin, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$37.91). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Verizon Communications insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$40m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Verizon Communications insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at Verizon Communications in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Verizon Communications.

As a result, softness in volumes has been weighing on its Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s performance. Within the segment, the Power Tools division is experiencing weakness (revenues down 5% organically in 2022) due to reduced consumer spending as a result of an increase in interest rates. For 2023, the company expects segmental organic revenues to decline in low-single digits with approximately 5% decrease in volumes.For 2023, Stanley Black expects a soft demand environment compared to that experienced last year. The company anticipates a decline in volumes compared to last year, with an expected decrease in new housing starts and remodel activity. SWK expects organic growth to decline in low-single digits in the year. For 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 0-$2. In 2022, it reported adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of $4.62 per share.Stanley Black has operations in multiple nations. Such business diversifications expose it to risks from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies, geopolitical issues and other headwinds. In fourth-quarter 2022, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 3% on sales.Supply-chain restrictions, primarily semiconductor constraints, and logistics and input cost increases weighed on Stanley Black’s operations in 2022. Despite improvement in supply-chain constraints and an anticipated reduction in raw material costs in 2023 due to deceleration in inflation, the persistence of these headwinds poses a threat to the company’s bottom-line performance. Evidently, in 2022, the company’s cost of sales jumped 24.3% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 5.5%.Among other industrial companies, A. O. Smith Corporation AOS and Nordson Corporation NDSN have been plagued by supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation.Over time, A. O. Smith has been dealing with the adverse impacts of the high cost of sales and operating expenses. In 2022, the cost of sales jumped 8.8% year over year. High raw material and transportation costs are pushing up the cost of sales.Apart from the high cost of sales, cost increases from production inefficiencies are hurting A. O. Smith’s bottom line (down 1.1% year over year in the fourth quarter). Supply-chain constraints and labor shortages are other headwinds for the company.Nordson has been dealing with the adverse impacts of the high cost of sales due to rising inflation. Cost of sales increased 12.1% year over year in fiscal 2022. The same increased 4.7% in the fiscal first quarter.High costs, supply-chain disruptions and labor challenges are weighing on Nordson’s margin performance. In the fiscal first quarter, NDSN’s gross margin decreased by approximately 190 basis points.Coming back to Stanley Black, while the company faces some near-term challenges, strength in the industrial business owing to strong backlogs and healthy demand for aerospace fasteners augur well. Cost-control measures partly offset the adverse impact of raw material cost inflation. Divestiture of non-core operations should help the company focus on its core areas of business growth. SWK’s consistent measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$5.6b ÷ (US$41b - US$6.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Thus, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Semiconductor industry average of 14%. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NVIDIA.What Can We Tell From NVIDIA's ROCE Trend?In terms of NVIDIA's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 32% over the last five years. However it looks like NVIDIA might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by NVIDIA's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 292% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing NVIDIA, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should be aware of.While NVIDIA may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

CAH recently announced its collaboration with Signify Health, Inc. SGFY. The partnership is expected to offer in-home clinical and medication management services via Cardinal Health’s Outcomes business.The collaboration will initially focus on addressing interventions recommended for Medicare Advantage members of joint clients and may expand into additional services (such as population health programs) and clinical interventions.The latest tie-up is expected to significantly strengthen Cardinal Health's medication therapy management services, which is a component of its broader Pharmaceutical segment, on a national scale.Rationale Behind the CollaborationPer Cardinal Health, studies have shown that many members do not take their medications as prescribed. This collaboration is expected to bring together Signify Health's mobile network of credentialed clinicians and Outcomes' OutcomesOne clinical care platform and omnichannel network of pharmacies and payers. This will likely help address medication management challenges for health plan members by offering coordinated care from Signify Health clinicians, who also perform evaluations of those members at home.Cardinal Health’s collaboration with Signify Health will likely aid in reducing costs and eradicate gaps in care for members nationwide to support their treatment journey from prescription to pharmacy and, ultimately, home.Per Cardinal Health’s management, as more patients recover and manage their chronic illnesses from home, the partnership with Signify Health will likely aid in driving more powerful connections across transitions of care. This is expected to enable pharmacies and payers to reach patients requiring additional support.Signify Health’s management believes the tie-up with Cardinal Health will enable it to make the vital service of medication management more convenient, accessible and connected to daily life. It will also likely improve medication safety and adherence and drive more value for the people currently being served by it.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Stratview Research, the global medication management market is projected to grow from $1.68 billion in 2020 to $5.41 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of approximately 21.5%. Factors like the increasing elderly population, increasing adoption of IT in healthcare and a surge in the incidence of chronic and infectious diseases are expected to drive the market.Given the growing market potential, the new collaboration seems to have been timed well.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Cardinal Health announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, where it recorded a solid uptick in its overall top line. Its Pharmaceutical segment’s revenues were also robust, which highlighted branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. The segment also recorded a solid uptick in its profit, driven by generics program performance and a higher contribution from the brand sales mix.In January, Cardinal Health announced its entry into a strategic collaboration with Palantir Technologies Inc. to design a solution that will give health systems and hospitals dynamic purchase decision insights to quickly improve their bottom line.In November 2022, Cardinal Health announced the launch of Velocare, a supply chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution capable of reaching patients in a few hours with critical products and services required for hospital-level care at home.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 37.2% in the past year against the industry’s 6.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500’s 8.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Cardinal Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

509,78fa573c-5ad9-3514-a95a-01c7f530b8cf,MCK,2023-03-09,Three Reasons to Add BD (BDX) Stock to Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-reasons-add-bd-bdx-170505758.html,1678295105,STORY,"['BDX', 'HOLX', 'MCK', 'AVNS']","[Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of a few product launches over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a few regulatory approvals, is expected to contribute further. Forex woes and significant consolidation persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 10.8% compared with 6.3% decline of the industry and 8.4% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical technology company has a market capitalization of $67.06 billion. It projects 7.8% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. BD has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.5% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Regulatory Approvals: BD has been progressing impressively on the regulatory front, raising our optimism. Last month, the company received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV (human papillomavirus) Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test.The same month, BD received the FDA’s EUA for a new molecular diagnostic combination test for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A + B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus — BD Respiratory Viral Panel assay for BD MAX System.Product Launches: We are upbeat about BD’s slew of product launches in recent times. Last month, the company announced a new instrument for single-cell multiomics analysis — BD Rhapsody HT Xpress System — that will enable scientists to run high-throughput studies without compromising sample integrity.During the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call the same month, BD stated that it had launched PosiFlush SafeScrub, a product in its Medical segment.Strong Q1 Results: BD’s solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy our optimism. An improvement in the overall base revenues and robust performances by the majority of its segments and in the United States were registered. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also witnessed. BD’s recent agreement with Biocorp and a co-exclusive commercial agreement with Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc. raises optimism.Story continuesDownsidesSignificant Consolidation: The medical technology industry has been experiencing a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of BD’s products.Forex Woes: BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD report with respect to its operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. BD cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which it can mitigate such risks.Estimate TrendBD is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.7% north to $12.14.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.66 billion, suggesting a 7% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fiscal second-quarter revenue estimate of $4.64 billion.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, McKesson Corporation MCK and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

510,47285766-f57d-3fa9-b29e-2a8107cf9b98,MCK,2023-03-09,All You Need to Know About McKesson (MCK) Rating Upgrade to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-mckesson-mck-rating-upgrade-170005124.html,1678294805,STORY,['MCK'],"[McKesson (MCK) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for McKesson basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For McKesson, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for McKessonThis prescription drug distributor is expected to earn $25.93 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 9.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for McKesson. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of McKesson to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SRDX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to reliance on third parties and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 46.4% compared with 37.3% decline of the industry and 5.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $327.1 million. Surmodics projects 46.6% growth for fiscal 2024, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 24.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.In January, Surmodics announced that the differentiated capabilities of its crystalline drug release platform for sirolimus-coated balloons were discussed in connection with 12-month data from its SWING trial at the International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy.Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. During the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in February, Surmodics confirmed that it had recently begun to conduct limited market evaluations to gain experience across a wide variety of cases and clinical conditions and assess the feedback from various physicians. Per management, the real-world feedback thus obtained will help inform future design enhancements that benefit physicians and patients while optimizing its commercial viability.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Surmodics’ better-than-expected earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2023 buoy optimism about the stock. The company registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and royalties and license fees. In October 2022, Surmodics announced its entry into a new, five-year credit agreement with MidCap Financial, which is encouraging.DownsidesReliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The revenues it derives from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Its failure or the failure of its licensees to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on Surmodics’ business.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has narrowed from a loss of $2.37 to a loss of $1.93 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $25.9 million, suggesting a 0.4% decline from the year-ago reported number.This compares to our second-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $26 million, suggesting a 0.2% dip from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Sean Major, sold US$152k worth of shares at a price of US$313 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$290. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. Sean Major was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Air Products and Chemicals Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Air Products and Chemicals shares. In total, Executive VP Sean Major sold US$152k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Air Products and Chemicals insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$214m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Air Products and Chemicals stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Air Products and Chemicals makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Air Products and Chemicals has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Saturday, ""It’s clear there is more work to do. In order to put this episode of high inflation behind us, further policy tightening, maintained for a longer time, will likely be necessary.""If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much further, the economy could slow or even enter into a recession. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingPhoto by floriane vita on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 14 American stocks with competitive advantages that have dividend growth potential in the future.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now14.

Air Products will also highlight the Freshline® Bottom Injection Cooling System that hygienically injects liquid nitrogen (LIN) or carbon dioxide (CO2) into a product during the mixing, blending or grinding process. Combined with Air Products' proprietary clean-in-place (CIP) and analytics platforms, producers will be well-equipped to maximize production safety and efficiency for the long term.Expo attendees are invited to stop by Air Products' booth 1672 in the Anaheim Convention Center to speak with an industry specialist about their specific processes and challenges. Food processors will discover the many benefits of Air Products' Freshline® solutions to improve a variety of processes, such as food freezing and chilling. The extremely cold temperatures of these cryogenic gases enable food products to be chilled or frozen in minutes instead of the hours traditionally required with alternative systems. This rapid freeze results in smaller product weight losses and helps to ensure moisture and quality are maintained longer.Cryogenic gases are also beneficial in grinding nutraceuticals, industrial hemp*, spices and other ingredients. During grinding operations, LIN or CO2 can be used to eliminate frictional heat to improve mill throughput and grind consistency. This also helps prevent the loss of flavor and aroma.Story continuesFor more than a half-century, Air Products' liquid nitrogen and CO2 have been used to chill products to the ideal forming temperature. In the food industry, liquid nitrogen and CO2 are commonly used to power tunnel and spiral freezers for the final preservation of food before it is packaged and shipped. These freezers offer customers smaller footprints and significantly lower cost compared to mechanical systems. Air Products also offers gaseous solutions including controlled atmosphere stunning, wastewater treatment, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), and inerting.A leader in cryogenic technology applications, Air Products operates food laboratories in the United States, Europe and Asia, where the company can test a customer's product on commercial-scale equipment to determine the feasibility of using cryogenic freezing or chilling for their specific process, and quantify the cost benefits of using cryogenics.

520,87bb2437-b7cc-31d7-8bea-2e0b35fef8e2,FOX,2023-03-09,Court records show political pressure behind Fox programming,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/court-records-show-political-pressure-060739408.html,1678342059,STORY,['FOXA'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — In May 2018, the nation's top Republicans needed help. So they called on the founder of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch.President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were trying to stop West Virginia Republicans from nominating Don Blankenship, who had been convicted of violating mine safety standards during a lethal accident in one of his coal mines, to challenge the state's incumbent senator, Democrat Joe Manchin.“Both Trump and McConnell are appealing for help to beat unelectable former mine owner who served time,” Murdoch wrote to executives at Fox News, according to court records released this week. “Anything during day helpful, but Sean (Hannity) and Laura (Ingraham) dumping on him hard might save the day.”Murdoch's prodding, revealed in court documents that are part of a defamation lawsuit by a voting systems company, is one example showing how Fox became actively involved in politics instead of simply reporting or offering opinions about it. The revelations pose a challenge to the credibility of the most watched cable news network in the U.S. at the outset of a new election season in which Trump is again a leading player, having declared his third run for the White House.Blankenship, who ended up losing the primary, said in an interview Wednesday that he felt the change right away, with the network's coverage taking a harsher turn in the final hours before the primary.“They were very smart about elections — they did their dumping the day before the election, so I had no time to react,” said Blankenship, who filed a separate, unsuccessful libel suit against Fox.On Wednesday, the network characterized Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit as a flagrant attack on the First Amendment and said the company had taken statements out of context. According to Fox, that included an acknowledgement by Murdoch that he shared with Jared Kushner, the head of Trump’s reelection campaign and the president’s son-in-law, an ad for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign that was to air on his network. Fox said the ad Murdoch forwarded to Kushner was already publicly available on YouTube and at least one television station.Story continues“Dominion has been caught red handed again using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on freedom of speech and freedom of the press,” Fox said in a statement.Fox has long been seen as a power in GOP politics with its large conservative fan base. But thousands of pages of documents released this week in the libel suit filed by Dominion show how the network blurred the line between journalism and party politics. Dominion sued after it became the target of 2020 election conspiracy theories, often promoted on Fox's airwaves.Murdoch also told executives at Fox News to promote the benefits of Trump's 2017 tax cut legislation and give extra attention to Republican Senate hopefuls, the documents show. He wanted the network “banging on” Biden's low-profile presidential campaign during the height of the pandemic in 2020.Nicole Hemmer, a Vanderbilt University history professor and author of the book “Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s,” said revelations in the lawsuit puncture Fox’s long argument that there is a dividing line between its news and opinion sides.“The real revelation here is how much of a fiction that division is,” Hemmer said. “Some who know Fox have argued that for awhile, but now we have real evidence.”Hemmer cited text messages disclosed in the court documents from early November 2020 sent by Fox's chief political correspondent, Bret Baier, urging the network's leaders to retract its correct election night call that President Joe Biden won Arizona. Baier advocated for putting Arizona “back in his column,” referring to Trump.In the days after the election, as Trump was making increasingly wild allegations that fraud cost him the White House, Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan Murdoch, who is executive chairman of the Fox Corp., texted with Fox News chief executive officer Suzanne Scott in alarm about a Trump rally.“News guys have to be careful how they cover this rally,"" Lachlan Murdoch wrote, according to the legal documents. ""So far some of the side comments are slightly anti, and they shouldn’t be. The narrative should be this huge celebration of the president. Etc.”Some of Fox's politicking — like star host Sean Hannity's frequent conversations with Trump during his presidency — is well known. But court papers show how Rupert Murdoch, the boss, inserted himself in the action, too.Murdoch emailed Scott in November 2017 and urged her to promote Trump's tax cut proposal, which had passed the House and was nearing a Senate vote.“Once they pass this bill we must tell our viewers again and again what they will get,” Murdoch wrote in the email, included in the court records. “Terrific, I understand, for all under $150k.”After the first presidential debate in 2020, a “horrified” Murdoch told Kushner that Trump should be more restrained in the next debate. (Trump canceled that event.)""That was advice from a friend to a friend,” Murdoch said in his deposition. “It wasn't advice from Fox Corporation or in my capacity at Fox.”“What's the difference?” asked Dominion's lawyer, Justin A. Nelson.“You've been — keep asking me questions as head of Fox,” Murdoch said. “It's a different role being a friend.”Murdoch's email banter with Kushner led to the exchange of the Biden ad, according to court records. That exchange is now the subject of a complaint from the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America to the Federal Elections Commission, arguing Fox made an illegal contribution to the Trump campaign by giving it information about Biden's advertisements. Fox said the sharing of public information can't be considered a contribution.Court records show that on Sept. 25, 2020, Murdoch emailed Kushner that “my people tell me” that Biden's ads “are a lot better creatively than yours. Just passing it on.”The same month, Murdoch wondered in an email to Col Allan, the former editor of the Murdoch-owned New York Post, “how can anyone vote for Biden?” Allen responded that Biden’s “only hope is to stay in his basement and not face serious questions.”“Just made sure Fox banging on about these issues,” Murdoch responded, according to court records. “If the audience talks the theme will spread.”Another prominent politician Murdoch describes as a “friend” is McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, then Trump's transportation secretary, had served on the Fox board. Murdoch said he would speak to the Republican Senate leader “three or four times a year.”In a special 2017 Republican Senate primary in Alabama, Murdoch said in his deposition, he told his top executives that he, like McConnell, opposed Roy Moore, a controversial former Alabama chief justice. Moore ultimately won the party’s nomination but lost the general election after he was credibly accused of sexual misconduct, including pursuing relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations.Murdoch, in the deposition, also cited his personal friendship with an unnamed Senate candidate in his suggestion to Scott that the network give extra attention to Republicans in close Senate races.Days before the 2020 election, after Fox business anchor Lou Dobbs was critical of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Murdoch asked Scott to have Hannity pump up Graham, who was facing an extremely well-funded challenge from Democrat Jamie Harrison.“You probably know about the Lou Dobbs outburst against Lindsay Graham,” Murdoch wrote on Oct. 27, misspelling the senator's first name in the copy of the message in the court documents. “Could Sean say something supportive? We can’t lose the Senate if at all possible.”Scott replied that Graham was on Hannity’s show the previous night “and he got a lot of time.” She added, “I addressed the Dobbs outburst.”___This story has been updated to correct the name of Dominion's attorney, Justin A.

Chairman Rupert Murdoch said under oath that he believes the 2020 presidential election was free, fair and not stolen, according to court filings released Tuesday in a lawsuit over Fox News’ coverage of former President Donald Trump’s unfounded election fraud claims.In sworn questioning in January by lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems, Murdoch was asked, “Do you believe that the 2020 presidential election was free and fair?""“Yes,” he replied, according to a transcript.“The election was not stolen,” he said later.Dominion is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion, saying the network crippled the company’s business by broadcasting false claims from Trump’s lawyers that Dominion had changed votes in the 2020 election.Hundreds of pages of exhibits in the lawsuit, which is expected to go to trial next month, were released late Tuesday. They shed further light on internal skepticism at Fox over the fraud claims and the network's worry about viewers angry with its own election-night declaration that Democrat Joe Biden had won Arizona. Those exhibits and earlier court filings demonstrate how Fox hosts and executives continued to promote those claims to viewers, despite strong doubts and denials behind the scenes.Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump’s attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also have been roundly rejected by dozens of courts, including by judges he had appointed.Fox says Dominion is inventing its claims of lost business and has cherry-picked and misrepresented remarks by Fox hosts and leaders to paint a picture of a company that threw truth aside to keep its audience.“Dominion has been caught red-handed using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press,” the company said in a statement Tuesday, complaining that “to twist and even misattribute quotes to the highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale.”Story continuesThe documents revealed top Fox executives discussed ways of mollifying anger from Trump's team over the election call, including a quick dismissal of a Washington executive who was behind the Arizona decision.“We don't want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo. He explained in the deposition, “He had a very large following, and they were probably mostly viewers of Fox, so it would have been stupid.”In an earlier unsealed filing in the Dominion case, Murdoch acknowledged that some of the network’s hosts — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false claims. He also said he didn’t stop the commentators from promoting the false claims from Trump allies that the election was stolen, even though he could have.Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox Corp. board member, said he never believed Trump’s conspiracy theories about the election.In a Dec. 7 text to Fox executive Lachlan Murdoch, Ryan suggested that Fox broadcast a “solid pushback” against the allegations of fraud, noting that “this is a key inflection point for Fox, where the right thing and the smart business thing to do line up nicely.”The exhibits included an extraordinary three-way text conversation on Nov. 16, 2020, among the stars of Fox's prime-time lineup: Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. In the conversation, the three opinion stars complained bitterly — and profanely — that they were being hurt by Fox's news division.“We devote our lives to building an audience and they let (news anchors) Chris Wallace and Leland ... Vittert wreck it,"" Carlson said, using an expletive.“I'm disgusted at this point,” Hannity said.Ingraham said that “we should all think about how together we can force a change. The audience that exists comes for us.”Carlson, who just this week told Fox News viewers that the election that unseated Trump “was a grave betrayal of American democracy,” spoke bluntly about the former president in text messages that were revealed as part of Dominion's case.On Jan. 4, 2021, Carlson told an unidentified person he was texting with that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.” He said of the outgoing president, “I hate him passionately.”In another text exchange more than a month earlier, Carlson denigrated Trump's business abilities: “What he's good at is destroy things. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.”The pressure on Fox from its audience after its correct Arizona call was felt in Fox's news ranks, too. In a memo sent two days after the election to Bill Sammon, Fox's managing editor in Washington, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said it was getting “really uncomfortable” having to defend the decision on the air.Baier suggested that the sooner Fox changed its decision and declared Trump the winner in Arizona, “the better we are,” even if it caused the network embarrassment.Sammon replied, “It's not pride that's got us sticking to the call — it's math. I'm confident we will be proven right.”He was — and two months later Fox forced him out of his job.The exhibits released Tuesday had several references to accusations against Dominion made by Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudolph Giuliani. In one email, Fox's Dana Perino references a Powell interview with Fox's Maria Bartiromo, saying “this is nuts.” Carlson says in a text message that “Sidney Powell is lying.""An email sent Tuesday to a representative of Powell seeking comment was not immediately returned.Four days after the election, Powell forwarded an email to Bartiromo from a woman who claimed that voting irregularities in a number of states had Dominion as “one common thread.”Fox said the woman's email has been misrepresented as being a key source of Fox's reporting on Dominion. Bartiromo said in her deposition that she didn't remember the email beyond forwarding it to her producer to check out.Also Tuesday, another voting tech company suing Fox News argued that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch played a leading role in airing false claims that its technology helped “steal” the 2020 presidential election from Trump.Smartmatic said the Murdochs, as the ultimate authorities at the network’s corporate parent, “directed Fox News Network to embrace disinformation following the 2020 U.S. election as a business decision.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersChatGPT helped me make a plan to buy a $500,000 home, but experts warn me it's a bad ideaThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

The network said in a statement the documents show Dominion using “distortions and misinformation” to “smear Fox News and trample on free speech.”The unsealed exhibits contain evidence underlying both parties’ dueling motions for summary judgment, filed last month, in which they seek rulings in their favor to avert a trial.In one exhibit, Murdoch emailed Fox News President Suzanne Scott on Jan. 21, 2021, asking: “Is it ‘unarguable that high profile Fox voices fed the story that the election was stolen and that January 6th an important chance to have the result overturned'? Maybe Sean and Laura went too far. All very well for Sean to tell you he was in despair about Trump but what did he tell his viewers?”Story continuesIn an earlier exchange with Scott, Murdoch wrote that it had been suggested to him that the network's primetime hosts say something like ""the election is over and Joe Biden won,"" according to Tuesday's filings. Murdoch told Scott that some version of this would ""go a long way to stop the Trump myth that the election stolen.""According to Dominion’s unsealed filings, Murdoch emailed a friend that the notion state legislators could change the election outcome - an idea then gaining traction on the right - “sound ridiculous. There’d be riots like never before.”“Stupid and damaging,"" Murdoch continued, referring to a news conference by then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. ""The only one encouraging Trump and misleading him. Both increasingly mad. The real danger is what he might do as president.”These exhibits and other material included in Dominion's summary judgment motion are part of the voting machine company’s effort to prove the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove to prevail in a defamation case.Fox has said that Dominion’s “extreme” interpretation of defamation law would “stop the media in its tracks"" and chill freedom of the press.Fox’s exhibits include more context of testimony and messages that it says Dominion “cherry-picked” and “misrepresented” in its summary judgment filing.For example, Fox cites additional testimony by Fox Corp co-chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch, who said under oath that he was “concerned” but “not overly concerned” by declining ratings after the election.Dominion has alleged Fox continued to push the stolen election narrative because it was losing viewers to right-wing outlets that embraced it.In another exhibit, Fox News host Hannity - quoted by Dominion as saying he “did not believe” Trump lawyer Sidney Powell’s claims “for one second” during a deposition - went on to say that during the interview he was giving her time to produce evidence but stopped having her appear on-air after she failed to deliver.A Dominion spokesperson said in a statement that the ""emails, texts, and deposition testimony speak for themselves. We welcome all scrutiny of our evidence because it all leads to the same place - Fox knowingly spread lies causing enormous damage to an American company.”The trial, set to begin on April 17, is slated to last five weeks.

Chairman Rupert Murdoch said under oath that he believes the 2020 presidential election was free, fair and not stolen, according to court filings released Tuesday in a lawsuit over Fox News’ coverage of former President Donald Trump’s unfounded election fraud claims.In sworn questioning in January by lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems, Murdoch was asked, “Do you believe that the 2020 presidential election was free and fair?""“Yes,” he replied, according to a transcript.“The election was not stolen,” he said later.Dominion is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion, saying the network crippled the company’s business by broadcasting false claims from Trump’s lawyers that Dominion had changed votes in the 2020 election.Hundreds of pages of exhibits in the lawsuit, which is expected to go to trial next month, were released late Tuesday. They shed further light on internal skepticism at Fox over the fraud claims and the network's worry about viewers angry with its own election-night declaration that Democrat Joe Biden had won Arizona. Those exhibits and earlier court filings demonstrate how Fox hosts and executives continued to promote those claims to viewers, despite strong doubts and denials behind the scenes.Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump’s attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also have been roundly rejected by dozens of courts, including by judges he had appointed.Fox says Dominion is inventing its claims of lost business and has cherry-picked and misrepresented remarks by Fox hosts and leaders to paint a picture of a company that threw truth aside to keep its audience.“Dominion has been caught red-handed using more distortions and misinformation in their PR campaign to smear Fox News and trample on free speech and freedom of the press,” the company said in a statement Tuesday, complaining that “to twist and even misattribute quotes to the highest levels of our company is truly beyond the pale.”Story continuesThe documents revealed top Fox executives discussed ways of mollifying anger from Trump's team over the election call, including a quick dismissal of a Washington executive who was behind the Arizona decision.“We don't want to antagonize Trump further,” Murdoch said in a Nov. 16 memo. He explained in the deposition, “He had a very large following, and they were probably mostly viewers of Fox, so it would have been stupid.”In an earlier unsealed filing in the Dominion case, Murdoch acknowledged that some of the network’s hosts — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false claims. He also said he didn’t stop the commentators from promoting the false claims from Trump allies that the election was stolen, even though he could have.Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox Corp. board member, said he never believed Trump’s conspiracy theories about the election.In a Dec. 7 text to Fox executive Lachlan Murdoch, Ryan suggested that Fox broadcast a “solid pushback” against the allegations of fraud, noting that “this is a key inflection point for Fox, where the right thing and the smart business thing to do line up nicely.”The exhibits included an extraordinary three-way text conversation on Nov. 16, 2020, among the stars of Fox's prime-time lineup: Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. In the conversation, the three opinion stars complained bitterly — and profanely — that they were being hurt by Fox's news division.“We devote our lives to building an audience and they let (news anchors) Chris Wallace and Leland ... Vittert wreck it,"" Carlson said, using an expletive.“I'm disgusted at this point,” Hannity said.Ingraham said that “we should all think about how together we can force a change. The audience that exists comes for us.”Carlson, who just this week told Fox News viewers that the election that unseated Trump “was a grave betrayal of American democracy,” spoke bluntly about the former president in text messages that were revealed as part of Dominion's case.On Jan. 4, 2021, Carlson told an unidentified person he was texting with that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.” He said of the outgoing president, “I hate him passionately.”In another text exchange more than a month earlier, Carlson denigrated Trump's business abilities: “What he's good at is destroy things. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.”The pressure on Fox from its audience after its correct Arizona call was felt in Fox's news ranks, too. In a memo sent two days after the election to Bill Sammon, Fox's managing editor in Washington, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said it was getting “really uncomfortable” having to defend the decision on the air.Baier suggested that the sooner Fox changed its decision and declared Trump the winner in Arizona, “the better we are,” even if it caused the network embarrassment.Sammon replied, “It's not pride that's got us sticking to the call — it's math. I'm confident we will be proven right.”He was — and two months later Fox forced him out of his job.The exhibits released Tuesday had several references to accusations against Dominion made by Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudolph Giuliani. In one email, Fox's Dana Perino references a Powell interview with Fox's Maria Bartiromo, saying “this is nuts.” Carlson says in a text message that “Sidney Powell is lying.""An email sent Tuesday to a representative of Powell seeking comment was not immediately returned.Four days after the election, Powell forwarded an email to Bartiromo from a woman who claimed that voting irregularities in a number of states had Dominion as “one common thread.”Fox said the woman's email has been misrepresented as being a key source of Fox's reporting on Dominion. Bartiromo said in her deposition that she didn't remember the email beyond forwarding it to her producer to check out.Also Tuesday, another voting tech company suing Fox News argued that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch played a leading role in airing false claims that its technology helped “steal” the 2020 presidential election from Trump.Smartmatic said the Murdochs, as the ultimate authorities at the network’s corporate parent, “directed Fox News Network to embrace disinformation following the 2020 U.S. election as a business decision.”___Associated Press writers Christina A.

The receptacles are placed at every glove station in Columbus Mid-Range Engine Plant.CumminsIn April of 2022, Columbus Mid-Range Engine Plant (CMEP) Materials Manager, Sven Creutz and Continuous Improvement Leader, Clayton Johnson, implemented a nitrile glove recycling program to divert waste from landfills.Since the program launched, the plant has gathered and shipped 1 ton of gloves to the Kimberly-Clark Professional RightCycle facility. If the plant continues to use an average of 530 cases of gloves they typically go through in a year, they could expect to divert almost 3.75 tons of waste from landfills each year.What are nitrile gloves?Nitrile gloves are a standard PPE practice in many food, industrial, and chemical lab environments. Made from the compound nitrile, these synthetic, rubber gloves are particularly popular due to their chemical and abrasion resistance. They are water, grease, and oil proof, often making them the top choice in gloves, over others like latex, for occupations working long hours and exposed to harmful substances.How are nitrile gloves used at CMEP?For plant employees, nitrile gloves work as a second barrier to protect Cummins employees from exposure to harmful chemicals and injury as they inspect the Cummins 6.7-liter diesel engine.Every hour, plant employees switch their gloves as a requirement to adhere to strict product quality standards. While use of the gloves protects employees and products, the waste produced can be large.Nitrile gloves are a single-use PPE item; after first use, they cannot be worn again for protection against harmful substances potentially left on the surface.In one year, 800 Columbus Mid-Range Engine Plant employees can go through over 530 cases of nitrile gloves, equating to roughly 875,000 gloves.The impact of the nitrile glove recycling programKimberly-Clark Professional, global corporation dedicated to producing consumer and company safety, healthiness, and hygienic products, and one of the first manufacturers to offer a recycling program for non-hazardous PEE, partnered with the plant to recycle and repurpose their biodegradable nitrile gloves.Story continuesThe Columbus Mid-Range Engine Plant is able to achieve key 2030 goals included in Cummins' PLANET 2050 strategy by creating a circular lifecycle for materials as well as generating less waste in facilities and operations through the recycling program.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742821/Cummins-Inc-Employees-Diverting-Tons-of-Single-Use-PPE-Waste-From-Landfills-Each-Year]"

It is important to recognize that the core of our destination zero strategy is about zero emissions solutions and advanced solutions,"" Chief Executive Jennifer Rumsey said in an interview.The Columbus, Indiana-based company, known for its diesel and natural gas engines, has accelerated its push towards clean energy solutions to sell to its industrial and commercial transporation customers as the trucking industry is expected to face tougher greenhouse emissions regulations this year.Like most manufacturers, Cummins has struggled with navigating supply chain challenges amid robust demand. Raw material shortages for engine components have caused an order backlog for equipment.""We are still working through that backlog,"" Rumsey said.Still, margins have remained solid, with the company forecasting revenue growth to be between 12% and 17% in 2023 as it anticipates strong demand for its engines used in trucks and other heavy vehicles.Cummins reported a jump of nearly 9% in fourth-quarter sales for its engine segment.As Cummins seeks to become a global leader in clean engines, an ongoing tight supply chain will be a challenge, said Noah Kaye, a senior research analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.""If you have a 'we can do it all' approach to electrification and alternative fuels, that means you have to reach deep into supply chains and that is not an easy proposition,"" he said.(Reporting by Bianca Flowers and Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)]"

Shares have added about 1.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Cummins due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cummins Q4 Earnings Miss EstimatesCummins reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $4.52 per share, which reflects substantial improvement from the prior-year quarter of $2.85 per share. But the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.66. Weaker-than-expected EBITDA in the Engine, Components and New Power segments resulted in the underperformance. Cummins’ revenues totaled $7.8 billion, up 32.8% from the $5.9 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion.Key TakeawaysIn the reported quarter, sales in the Engine segment were up 9% year over year to $2.63 billion. The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 billion. The segment’s EBITDA increased to $364 million (accounting for 13.8% of sales) from $264 million (10.9% of sales). But the metric lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $432 million. On-highway revenues climbed 11%, driven by pricing actions and strong demand in the North American truck markets, strong aftermarket demand and smart pricing actions. Off-highway revenues declined 1% as a result of a slowdown in China construction. Sales increased by 21% in North America but fell by 16% in international markets.Sales in the Distribution segment totaled $2.3 billion, up 13% year over year and beat the consensus mark of $2.1 billion. The segment’s EBITDA came in at $256 million (11% of sales), up from the previous year’s $178 million (8.6% of sales). Also, the metric surpassed the consensus mark of $225 million. Revenues from North America jumped 24%, while international sales plunged by 5%. Higher revenues were driven by increased demand for parts and services.Story continuesSales in the Components segment were up 13% from the prior-year quarter to $3.1 billion (excluding Meritor buyout impact) and surpassed the consensus mark of $3.05 billion. Sales in North America were up 23%, while the same in international markets increased by 1% amid strong demand in India, partially offset by weak demand from China. The segment’s EBITDA was $377 million (12.2% of sales) compared with the year-ago figure of $205 million (11.9% of sales). The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $421 million.Sales in the Power Systems segment rose 22% from the year-ago quarter to $1.3 billion, topping the consensus mark of $1.2 billion. The segment’s EBITDA increased to $185 million (14% of sales) from $97 million (8.9% of sales) and beat the consensus mark of $127 million. Power generation revenues were up 25% and industrial revenues rose 17%.Sales in the New Power segment came in at $75 million, soaring 79% from the year-ago level and outperforming the consensus metric of $62 million.

Long-term debt totaled $4,498 million, up from $3,579 million on Dec 31, 2021. During FY2022, Cummins maintained its streak of increasing cash dividends for the 13th consecutive year in 2023. It spent a total of $1.2 billion in dividends and share repurchases in 2022.2023 OutlookCummins expects revenues to grow in the range of 12 year over year. EBITDA is forecasted in the range of 14.5%-15.2% of sales. Cummins continues to stick to its plan of returning nearly 50% of its operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Cummins has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this engine maker have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, which Cummins falls in, has gained 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.70 per share, indicating a change of +16.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.3%. This estimate has changed -5.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.53 indicates a change of +3% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cummins is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cummins, the consensus sales estimate of $8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25.3%. The $32.06 billion and $32.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.2% and +0%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.8%. EPS of $4.52 for the same period compares with $2.85 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.6%. The EPS surprise was -3%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Discovery (WBD) feeling the pressure as profitability struggles mount.Unfavorable macroeconomic headwinds and foreign exchange rates, coupled with decreased ad budgets amid a decline in linear TV and digital search trends, put the ad market through a particularly rough 2022.Recent ad market softness comes as media giants like Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) have embraced ad-supported streaming alternatives as the race for subscribers escalates. With losses piling up just as fast.Disney's direct-to-consumer division lost a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1. Paramount (PARA), meanwhile, reported a direct-to-consumer loss of roughly $1.82 billion last year.Warner Bros. Discovery, which is now targeting $4 billion in cost savings over the next two years, reported a net loss of $2.1 billion in the three months ending December 31. The company previously reported a loss of $2.3 billion in Q3 and a $3.4 billion loss in Q2.""The ad market feels to me like it's stabilized a bit,"" NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said during the company's latest earnings call in January, pointing to increased improvements in categories like pharmacy, entertainment, and travel. ""We're assuming it will stay weak for the first half of this year and then recover but who knows with this economy.""Advertising revenue within NBCUniversal's media division increased 4% in Q4, primarily due to incremental revenue from the FIFA World Cup as well as an increase in Peacock advertising revenue.Looking ahead, the lack of cyclical events in 2023 such as the World Cup, Olympics, or U.S. midterm elections, will likely be a drag on ad spend in 2023.According to data from media investment and intelligence company Magna Global cited by Forbes, those events greatly aided the battered industry with the domestic ad market totaling $318 billion last year — an increase of 8% compared to 2021. Magna estimates U.S. ad spend will grow by 3.7% in 2023, lower than its September forecast of 4.8%.Story continuesSports, autos, pharma encouragingBob Bakish, Paramount Global CEO, agreed the back half of this year should see an ad market recovery, telling investors during the company's latest earnings call: ""2023 will also be an important year with respect to advertising, where we are looking forward to an improvement in the market in the back half of the year.""""The ad market, as you know, has been cyclically tough and, like our peers, we felt this impact in 2022.""Media executives like Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish have weighed in on the state of the advertising market this earnings seasonAd growth within Paramount's TV media division decreased 7% year-over-year in Q4 amid lower impressions and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Overall, the company saw a 5% decline in quarterly ad revenue after a 2% drop in Q3.Still, Bakish said the company is ""seeing early signs of stabilization in advertising,"" adding: ""The sports marketplace continues to be active across the NFL, PGA, and NCAA. We like what we're seeing in travel and pharma — and recent activity in auto is encouraging.""Looking ahead, the executive warned, ""the combination of streaming investment and the current state of the ad market will impact earnings and cash flow in 2023. We see that narrowing significantly in 2024, resulting in meaningful total company earnings growth and a return to positive free cash flow.""But not every media giant is fully convinced the market will improve.A 'very slow' year for someWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said last month cyclical headwinds and ongoing secular challenges will likely pressure the company in the year ahead, especially as it relates to advertising.Zaslav told investors he expects ad sales to be ""very slow"" in 2023 but, echoing his peers, is hopeful for improvements later this year. WBD's network advertising revenue tumbled by 17% in the fourth quarter, or 14% excluding foreign exchange, after falling 11% (ex foreign exchange) in Q3.Similarly, Spotify (SPOT) CFO Paul Vogel told investors on a Jan. 31 earnings call: ""Advertising in Q4, overall, it's definitely continued to be very up and down.""David Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, talks to reporters upon his arrival for the annual Allen and Co. conference at Sun Valley, Idaho July 9, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS)""In Q4, we outperformed our expectations. Admittedly, those were lowered expectations, [but] we actually outperformed those by about €50 million or so...and even within that we had two months that outperformed and one month that underperformed...it was pretty up and down.""Vogel said he expects similar trends in Q1 and, although the company feels confident about its ad stack and recent acquisitions, he reiterated the macro still remains ""uncertain.""Spotify's Q4 ad-supported revenue, boosted by podcasting, grew 14% on a year-over-year basis to €449 million — accounting for 14% of total revenue.Disney, Netflix embrace ad-supported productsDisney and Netflix debuted their respective ad tiers at a time when the ad market was in flux, but the move seems to have been a lucrative one — at least so far — with positive sentiment from both Wall Street and high-level executives.Disney, which rolled out its ad-supported tier in early December, said it was ""pleased"" with subscribers' initial reaction to the new offering on its latest earnings call.At the time of the debut, the company said over 100 advertisers bought inventory for the launch — bucking the trend of a global ad spend slowdown.CFO Christine McCarthy told investors the ad-tier will not produce ""meaningful financial impact"" until later this fiscal year, but analysts have continuously argued the rollout was a ""critical"" needle mover for revenue.""I think [the ad tier] moves the needle pretty substantially,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan previously told Yahoo Finance. ""It's absolutely very, very critical, and they've done it at the right time.""The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniSimilar to Disney, Netflix is playing the long game when it comes to its recently launched ad-supported tier, which officially debuted in November.The company is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate) but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.According to Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman, the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch. Another sign ad buyers are willing to spend on new growth areas, especially as consumers' viewing habits change.In its latest shareholder letter, Netflix said engagement for ad-supported subscribers ""is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected, and we believe the lower price point is driving incremental membership growth.""Netflix went as far as to say its ad business could be even larger than Hulu's, with CFO Spencer Neumann telling investors: ""It's a multi-year path. We're not going to be larger than Hulu in year one, but, hopefully, over the next several years, we can be at least as large.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(AP) — The first meeting of the new board of Walt Disney World’s government — overhauled by sweeping legislation signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis as punishment for Disney publicly challenging Florida's so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill — dealt with the rote affairs any other municipal government would handle: calls for better firefighter equipment, lessons on public records requests and bond ratings.But the five board members appointed by DeSantis hinted Wednesday at future controversial actions they may take, including prohibiting COVID-19 restrictions at Disney World and recommending the elimination of two cities that were created after the Florida Legislature in 1967 approved the theme park resort's self-governance.The board also approved hiring the same law firm that advised the governor's office in making changes to the governing district to help interpret the new legislation.For the most part, the new board members listened in a hotel ballroom outside Disney World as members of the public and workers from the district's departments explained what they do.Martin Garcia, the board's new chair, said the major distinction between the old board controlled by Disney and the new one appointed by DeSantis will be a broader constituency encompassing more than just a single company, instead also representing workers and residents of surrounding communities.“You didn’t elect us, but the people of Florida elected a governor who appointed us,” Garcia said. “I see there will be much broader representation.”The other new board members for what has been rechristened the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District included Bridget Ziegler, a conservative school board member and wife of the Florida Republican party chairman Christian Ziegler; Brian Aungst Jr., an attorney and son of a former two-term Republican mayor of Clearwater; Mike Sasso, an attorney; and Ron Peri, head of The Gathering USA ministry.Story continuesThey replaced a board that had been controlled by Disney during the previous 55 years that the government operated as the Reedy Creek Improvement District.The new name will require a new logo to replace the old one that's on 123 vehicles, 300 trash cans and 1,000 manhole covers, district administrator John Classe told board members.The takeover of the Disney district by DeSantis and the Florida Legislature began last year when the entertainment giant, facing intense pressure, publicly opposed “Don’t Say Gay,” which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as well as lessons deemed not age-appropriate.DeSantis moved quickly to penalize the company, directing lawmakers in the GOP-dominated Legislature to dissolve Disney’s self-governing district during a special legislative session, beginning a closely watched restructuring process.In taking on Disney, DeSantis furthered his reputation as a culture warrior willing to battle perceived political enemies and wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals, a strategy that is expected to continue ahead of his potential White House run.After the meeting, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences &amp; Products, said in a statement that he was hopeful the new board would continue to maintain “the highest standards"" for the resort's infrastructure, set by its predecessor, and support ongoing growth at the resort.During public comments at Wednesday's meeting, the leader of the union for the district’s firefighters, which had clashed with the previous board, welcomed the new members, calling the new board “a fresh start.” Jon Shirey urged the new board to devote resources to purchasing new fire trucks, improving pay and increasing staff, saying the 32 firefighters who are on duty each day is just two more than it was in 1989.""It’s safe to say that Disney has grown exponentially,” Shirey said.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Others say it's still up and down. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with more. Allie, which is it? What's going on?ALEXANDRA CANAL: The moral of the story is here, we don't know. But this has been top of mind for investors because this shaky ad market, it has impacted results, both in the fourth quarter and really all of 2022. So I listened in on all of these recent earnings calls, and here are some of the top takeaways from these media executives. Number one, most media execs believe we will see the ad market improve in the back half of 2023 and that things will still be up and down in the first half, similar to what we saw in Q4.That being said, a lack of cyclical events, such as the World Cup, in addition to the Olympics and the US midterm elections, that will all likely be a drag on ad spend this year. So something to keep in mind as we monitor the progress of this recovery. Areas of strength in the market so far include sports, pharma, travel, and most recently, autos, as the chip market has seen more improvements there.But overall, the macro still remains uncertain. And none of these executives could really give a firm prediction of the future here. But if we take a look back to 2022, recent data from media investment and intelligence company Magna Global estimated the domestic ad market totaled 318 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2021, largely due to those cyclical events.For 2023, Magna estimates US ad spend will grow by 3.7%, lower than its September forecast of 4.8%, as the economy is expected to remain pressured early in 2023 before picking up as inflation cools. So like I said, it's still to be determined this year. I think in 2024, we're going to have a bit more clarity when it comes to where the ad market stands as those macro conditions improve. But for now, it is encouraging to see at least some optimism from these companies when it comes to the back half of the year.Story continuesINES FERRE: So given the ad market and where we're at there, what does this mean for companies like Disney, like Netflix, which started offering its ad-based-- ad-supported subscriptions?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and that was a really interesting time for these companies to debut their ad-supported tiers, right? We had all these macro concerns. However, a lot of these streaming giants were hemorrhaging money, and they needed ways to supplement their revenue outside of those premium subscription tiers. Advertising is one great way to do that. And from the updates that we've been given so far, it seems like it's working out. We haven't had a lot of details, a lot of specifics at this point, considering both Netflix and Disney rolled out their ad-supported tiers at the end of last year, Netflix in November, Disney in December.But at the time of Disney's debut, the company said over 100 advertisers bought inventory for the launch. Similarly, Netflix revealed it nearly sold out of all of its own ad inventory globally for their respective launch. So multiple signs that ad buyers, they're still willing to spend money where consumers are. And right now, that is on streaming platforms. So I'm sure over the next six months to a year, we're going to get even more updates on how those ad-supported tiers are doing.INES FERRE: I will confess that I signed up for Netflix to watch that Jonah Hill documentary.JULIE HYMAN: You didn't--INES FERRE: I did not like it.JULIE HYMAN: Wait, you didn't have Netflix before?INES FERRE: With the ads.ALEXANDRA CANAL: With the ads.JULIE HYMAN: Oh, with the ads.INES FERRE: With the ads. I didn't like it. I did not like it because if you try to avoid the ads by going somewhere else on your browser, it stops the ad, and then you've got to listen to it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: OK.INES FERRE: So yeah.JULIE HYMAN: I haven't watched a-- I guess I watched the commercials during the Super Bowl. That's the only time I watch commercials. The rest of the time--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Even then, I feel distracted during that.INES FERRE: It's worth it without the ads, I think. It's worth it.]"

Actions that demonstrate the Bank's mission and purpose following challenging events in its community.An examination of customer trends including current impacts of inflation.""Over the past year, the impact of inflation is clearly visible for the financially vulnerable"", said Jones. He goes on to say: ""…if the gap between their income growth and price increases continues even at its present pace, it would not be a welcome trend. None of this is to say a soft landing is not possible… Rather, we are reminded that economic cycles persist and that we and our customers are preparing for what might lie ahead.""Concluding the letter, Jones says, ""This past year … we learned a great deal about the world and about how we can improve our bank to better serve our customers. A community-focused banking model fails quickly without model community bankers who work tirelessly to cultivate customer relationships and then work harder, still, to figure out what matters to a community and how they might then solve a problem and make a difference.

That is because the Jul 21, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Under Armour shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Under Armour is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Textile - Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 14 cents per share to 15 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Under Armour right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts. Dividend zombies are companies with century-long dividend payouts, whereas dividend kings are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 50 years or more. 2022 was a difficult year from an investing point of view due to high inflation and continuous changes in monetary policies. Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&amp;P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time.Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&amp;P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7.In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some other dividend companies with long dividend growth streaks.In February, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's organic sales.At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $28.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 107 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 27International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), also known as Big Blue, is a New York-based technology company that has operations in over 175 countries.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Colgate-Palmolive. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Colgate-Palmolive. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Colgate-Palmolive's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Colgate-Palmolive. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. With 8.2% and 6.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$64m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

PMP solutions are mainly used to backhaul video surveillance systems.

Moreover, with the rapid transition to Wi-Fi 6 solutions, Cambium witnessed major improvements in enterprise Wi-Fi solutions supported by improved field deployments.Some of its competitive strengths are advanced RF signal algorithms that boost network performance with evolving technologies like noise filtering and frequency reuse and efficient wireless fabric that enables operators to strengthen their networks with incremental fixed wireless access points.

Discovery (WBD) feeling the pressure as profitability struggles mount.Unfavorable macroeconomic headwinds and foreign exchange rates, coupled with decreased ad budgets amid a decline in linear TV and digital search trends, put the ad market through a particularly rough 2022.Recent ad market softness comes as media giants like Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) have embraced ad-supported streaming alternatives as the race for subscribers escalates. With losses piling up just as fast.Disney's direct-to-consumer division lost a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1. Paramount (PARA), meanwhile, reported a direct-to-consumer loss of roughly $1.82 billion last year.Warner Bros. Discovery, which is now targeting $4 billion in cost savings over the next two years, reported a net loss of $2.1 billion in the three months ending December 31. The company previously reported a loss of $2.3 billion in Q3 and a $3.4 billion loss in Q2.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.""The ad market feels to me like it's stabilized a bit,"" NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said during the company's latest earnings call in January, pointing to increased improvements in categories like pharmacy, entertainment, and travel. ""We're assuming it will stay weak for the first half of this year and then recover but who knows with this economy.""Advertising revenue within NBCUniversal's media division increased 4% in Q4, primarily due to incremental revenue from the FIFA World Cup as well as an increase in Peacock advertising revenue.Looking ahead, the lack of cyclical events in 2023 such as the World Cup, Olympics, or U.S. midterm elections, will likely be a drag on ad spend in 2023.According to data from media investment and intelligence company Magna Global cited by Forbes, those events greatly aided the battered industry with the domestic ad market totaling $318 billion last year — an increase of 8% compared to 2021. Magna estimates U.S. ad spend will grow by 3.7% in 2023, lower than its September forecast of 4.8%.Story continuesSports, autos, pharma encouragingBob Bakish, Paramount Global CEO, agreed the back half of this year should see an ad market recovery, telling investors during the company's latest earnings call: ""2023 will also be an important year with respect to advertising, where we are looking forward to an improvement in the market in the back half of the year.""""The ad market, as you know, has been cyclically tough and, like our peers, we felt this impact in 2022.""Media executives like Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish have weighed in on the state of the advertising market this earnings seasonAd growth within Paramount's TV media division decreased 7% year-over-year in Q4 amid lower impressions and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Overall, the company saw a 5% decline in quarterly ad revenue after a 2% drop in Q3.Still, Bakish said the company is ""seeing early signs of stabilization in advertising,"" adding: ""The sports marketplace continues to be active across the NFL, PGA, and NCAA. We like what we're seeing in travel and pharma — and recent activity in auto is encouraging.""Looking ahead, the executive warned, ""the combination of streaming investment and the current state of the ad market will impact earnings and cash flow in 2023. We see that narrowing significantly in 2024, resulting in meaningful total company earnings growth and a return to positive free cash flow.""But not every media giant is fully convinced the market will improve.A 'very slow' year for someWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said last month cyclical headwinds and ongoing secular challenges will likely pressure the company in the year ahead, especially as it relates to advertising.Zaslav told investors he expects ad sales to be ""very slow"" in 2023 but, echoing his peers, is hopeful for improvements later this year. WBD's network advertising revenue tumbled by 17% in the fourth quarter, or 14% excluding foreign exchange, after falling 11% (ex foreign exchange) in Q3.Similarly, Spotify (SPOT) CFO Paul Vogel told investors on a Jan. 31 earnings call: ""Advertising in Q4, overall, it's definitely continued to be very up and down.""David Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, talks to reporters upon his arrival for the annual Allen and Co. conference at Sun Valley, Idaho July 9, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS)""In Q4, we outperformed our expectations. Admittedly, those were lowered expectations, [but] we actually outperformed those by about €50 million or so...and even within that we had two months that outperformed and one month that underperformed...it was pretty up and down.""Vogel said he expects similar trends in Q1 and, although the company feels confident about its ad stack and recent acquisitions, he reiterated the macro still remains ""uncertain.""Spotify's Q4 ad-supported revenue, boosted by podcasting, grew 14% on a year-over-year basis to €449 million — accounting for 14% of total revenue.Disney, Netflix embrace ad-supported productsDisney and Netflix debuted their respective ad tiers at a time when the ad market was in flux, but the move seems to have been a lucrative one — at least so far — with positive sentiment from both Wall Street and high-level executives.Disney, which rolled out its ad-supported tier in early December, said it was ""pleased"" with subscribers' initial reaction to the new offering on its latest earnings call.At the time of the debut, the company said over 100 advertisers bought inventory for the launch — bucking the trend of a global ad spend slowdown.CFO Christine McCarthy told investors the ad-tier will not produce ""meaningful financial impact"" until later this fiscal year, but analysts have continuously argued the rollout was a ""critical"" needle mover for revenue.""I think [the ad tier] moves the needle pretty substantially,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan previously told Yahoo Finance. ""It's absolutely very, very critical, and they've done it at the right time.""The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniSimilar to Disney, Netflix is playing the long game when it comes to its recently launched ad-supported tier, which officially debuted in November.The company is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate) but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.According to Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman, the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch. Another sign ad buyers are willing to spend on new growth areas, especially as consumers' viewing habits change.In its latest shareholder letter, Netflix said engagement for ad-supported subscribers ""is consistent with members on comparable ad-free plans, is better than what we had expected, and we believe the lower price point is driving incremental membership growth.""Netflix went as far as to say its ad business could be even larger than Hulu's, with CFO Spencer Neumann telling investors: ""It's a multi-year path. We're not going to be larger than Hulu in year one, but, hopefully, over the next several years, we can be at least as large.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

And that eye-popping total will reach $60 billion by next year. According to the SportsBusiness Global Media Report, the next rights jump ball is the NBA deal, which expires after the '24-'25 season. But who will retain possession?Jessica Reif Ehrlich is the Bank of America Senior Media and Entertainment Analyst, joins us now. Nice to see you, Jessica. Thanks so much. So how much do you believe the NBA is seeking in this new deal?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: The speculation is that the rights deal will be at least 100%, if not 200% higher, so two to three times the current package.- So ESPN and Turner currently control the rights. Do you believe they are the favorites?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: You know, incumbents usually are the favorites. They have an exclusive negotiating window. They also have the right of last refusal. So it's highly likely they will keep the rights.But it's a negotiation. And these are incredibly attractive rights. The NBA has a long season, which actually fits really well with ESPN because it gives them year-round programming.It's very important programming for Warner Bros. Discovery as well. It's on Turner. So they obviously want to retain those rights.There's speculation that there are other traditional media companies that want those rights. But we're fairly sure that there will be a FAANG company coming in. Whether it's Apple, Amazon, or one of the others, we'll see.But they have been increasingly involved in sports. You see Amazon with ""Thursday Night Football,"" Apple with Major League Soccer. And so it's a big driver for their own streaming platforms.- I do want to follow up on that. But first, Warner Bros. Discovery has tens of millions tied up in their talent with Charles Barkley, and Shaq, and Ernie Johnson. Could that influence their decision?Story continuesOn the other hand, the other favorite is Disney. And Bob Iger has really suggested cost cutting is central to them. So how does that impact both of their chances or desire to move forward?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: Well, just in streaming in general, all of the companies, certainly the traditional media companies, but Netflix as well, have a focus on cost containment and allocating to the most important-- you know, allocating their resources to the most important content. The NBA is clearly highly desirable. There's a very young audience.Sports betting is driving viewing. Sports ratings are up a lot. And so you have sports betting, it's part of the pop culture.And as these companies transition from linear to digital, it's a really great kind of segue for them where they can straddle-- you see that with the NFL, all of the traditional media companies also have digital rights. But it's also important for the NBA.Yes, it's fantastic programming. But it's important for them to keep their fans, and especially to attract younger viewers. So they have to be able-- they have to have a way to reach them.And with the decline in linear-- you have to have reach, so you need linear. But with the continuation of cord cutting, it is important to have some streaming options, some digital options.So obviously ESPN, ESPN+, and Warner Bros. Discovery, and HBO Max, they have those streaming options. But given the speculation of how much this package will go for, we just view a third party coming in as highly likely to make up the difference.- Yeah.JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: And if you look at all of the sports that have been renewed over the last few years, everything's gone up double or more.- Yeah, the number out there, between $50 and $75 billion. The outsider or newcomer, Comcast via NBC, how serious a competitor could they be?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: Well, Comcast has all the assets that are desirable. They have a broadcast network in NBC. They have cable networks and all of the NBCU networks, NBC Sports. And they have streaming through Peacock, so they have it all.The problem for Comcast is that it would be a major step up for them. So for Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney, it's a step up from the current contract. In a recent report we did, we noted that at a billion dollar increase for each party, for both of them, it's several percentage points increase in-- or taken out of their EBITDA.But for somebody like Comcast to come in and to first bid, it would be a very hefty impact. It would have very hefty impact on their total cost structure, and would make a dent in their cash flow and their EBITDA. So it's a little tougher for them to come in as a new player. Much easier for the incumbents to just bid a little more--- Circling back to streaming--JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: --we'll see.- --apologies, and the dream scenario for the NBA, which is likely Amazon and Apple in a bidding war-- we saw Apple grab the MLS, and Amazon get in the NFL deal. Could that develop? And given what we saw with the NFL, saw a decline in Thursday night ratings on Amazon, do you think they'll put a priority on profits or on ratings, revenue or ratings?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: I mean, the thing-- right, right. But the thing with the NFL on Thursday, it started off a little bit weak. They had to learn the business. And it's gotten much better. So like, now, everyone's saying how fantastic Amazon's doing with ""Thursday Night Football."" And they took over a loss-making contract from Fox. So Fox was losing $300 to $400 million a year on that. And Amazon bid a lot more.So it is a big driver of revenue for all of the sports leagues because the FAANGs have bigger balance sheets and seem to be able to pay more. But it's important to consider reach as well, which is why we don't think it would just go to one or two FAANGs. We do believe that the traditional players will be a major part of any new contract.- Interesting. The most recent media deal we saw was that huge deal from Google. They grabbed the Sunday NFL Ticket package, rumored to be around $2.5 bill per year. We talked to Wedbush's Michael Pachter what he thinks about that deal. I want you to hear what he had to say.MICHAEL PACHTER: Live sports is a hook to keep someone subscribing. So it makes sense for a cable provider, for Comcast. And it makes sense for a retransmission company like CBS or NBC to buy sports rights.I think Google's going to fail miserably with the YouTube purchase of Sunday Ticket. I think that's going to end up being a disaster for them.- Do you agree with that? And will that teach Amazon or Apple a thing or two about the cost of these media rights?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: It's really hard to say. You have to see-- they're going up a learning curve. And the FAANGs typically don't have the production expertise. I think Amazon is still using NBC for production.But as I said earlier, they have much bigger balance sheets. But it's true, the first part of the comment was, it does keep-- sports drives advertising. It drives affiliate fees. It does keep viewers engaged. Ratings are actually up pretty dramatically on NFL. So it is really important programming.So if you are trying to establish a beachhead, then it's critical programming. It's impossible for me to say what Google's long-term ambitions are in video, and what they plan-- how they plan to develop their service.- Going to be a fascinating watch to see who gets these NBA rights. Jessica Reif Ehrlich, Bank of America, thanks so much. Appreciate it.]"

That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$101 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$99.08. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Prudential Financial insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Prudential Financial insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$60m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Prudential Financial Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Prudential Financial stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy!

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Devon EnergyIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Jeffrey Ritenour, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$58.35 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$54.50. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 19.71k shares for US$1.0m. On the other hand they divested 83.20k shares, for US$5.1m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Devon Energy shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Devon Energy Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Devon Energy insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$1.0m for shares in the company -- and none sold. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Devon EnergyI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Devon Energy insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$255m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Devon Energy Tell Us?It is good to see recent purchasing. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. The high levels of insider ownership, and the recent buying by some insiders suggests they are well aligned and optimistic. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest. Short interest refers to the total number of shares of a particular stock that investors have borrowed and sold short, betting that the stock's price will decline. Low short interest means that there are relatively few shares of a stock that have been sold short. This could be a sign that investors are generally optimistic about the stock's prospects and are not expecting its price to drop significantly in the near term. Short selling can be a viable strategy for experienced investors who are willing to take on a higher level of risk. It is useful for investors who believe that a particular stock is overvalued and are willing to bet on its price going down.In 2022, short sellers won big as shorted stocks returned 30.8%, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500, according to a report by financial data marketplace, S3 Partners. The report also mentioned that short sellers in the US recorded $300 billion in market-to-market profits on the average short interest of $973 billion. Another data by Goldman Sachs showed that the 50 most shorted stocks in the Russell 3000 returned 15% this year through January 26, compared with a 6% return of the broader market.Insider Monkey's premium newsletters also use short selling to generate positive returns as well as to weed out risky long candidates. In this article we are also going to utilize short interest to weed out risky high dividend stocks. Usually stocks with very high dividend yields have high dividend yields because their stock prices declined by large amounts and there are valid reasons for those declines. These stocks usually have very high open short interest. Some of these high dividend stocks may continue their declines and be forced to cut their dividends to ""save"" their companies. Intel Corporation (INTC) is a good example. Intel was offering $0.365 in quarterly dividend and its dividend yield increased to nearly 6% as its stock price declined from $52 to $25 over the past year. Two weeks ago, Intel announced that it cut its dividend from $0.365 to $0.125. Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of hedge funds shorting Intel and, even though its open short interest is 2.5 times above Honeywell's - a company with similar market cap -, our quantitative screen of excluding high short interest stocks approach wouldn't have been successful in this case because Intel's short interest is 1.83% (see 10 biggest dividend cuts in 2022)Story continuesThe fluctuating market conditions have turned investors’ attention toward dividend companies as these stocks can generate stable and regular income for shareholders. Moreover, dividend stocks have contributed significantly to the market’s overall return. According to a report by Fidelity, dividends have represented 40% of the stock market’s returns since 1930 and 54% during decades when inflation was at its peak. Some of the most popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).In view of the above discussion, we will discuss dividend giants with the lowest short interest in this article.12 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short InterestPhoto by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion and dividend yields above 5%, as of March 7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Another laggard in Q4 was investment manager Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX). Shares came under pressure along with those of other alternative asset managers due to price declines across asset markets. Blackstone has been met with redemptions in its private real estate fund BREIT (Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust), one of the company’s strong growth drivers in the attractive high net worth channel. Redemptions have picked up due to concerns about the real estate market due to higher interest rates, and because BREIT has been a strong performing product, investors are selling their winners to gain liquidity in an environment where their other assets may have lost value. In early January 2023, it was announced that the University of California is putting $4 billion into BREIT with the same fees as other shareholders but with a commitment to hold shares for 6 years. This announcement may help to allay concerns about BREIT’s stability in the face of redemptions. We still view the business as a proven long-term compounder of value, driven by a virtuous cycle of strong investment results leading to fundraising success. Blackstone remains a smaller position in the portfolio.”6.

The collective value of these stakes is over $823.5 million.GoodHaven Capital Management mentioned Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest. Suggested articles:15 Countries with Highest Inflation Rates20 Most Important Companies in the World10 Hot Growth Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call, as well as the presentation slides, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current plans, estimates and expectations and are inherently uncertain.Actual results for future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of risks or other factors that are described in greater detail under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and filed with the SEC on March 21, 2022, and in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC from time to time. Forward-looking statements included are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events, except as otherwise required by law. I will now turn the call over to Robert.Robert Alpert: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call. In a year dominated by shifting and more challenging macroeconomic backdrop, P10 delivered double-digit growth and strong fourth quarter and full year 2022 profitability. Driven by an expanding and diverse set of strategies with long track records of investing through a variety of market cycles, we strengthened our position as the premier specialized private markets solution provider in the middle and lower middle market. For 2022, fee-paying AUM increased 23%. Revenues increased 32% and adjusted EBITDA increased 29%. Besides delivering noteworthy financial performance, P10 completed the acquisition of WTI, a clear market leader in the growing venture debt space.Story continuesWe have much to be thankful for as we reflect on the year's achievements. As we consider 2023, we want to reaffirm our previous fundraising guidance, which results in expected double-digit revenue and profit growth. Amanda will share more about this later in the call. One more thing I want to mention is that on December 27, 2022, we announced an additional $20 million stock buyback. In the fourth quarter, we found our stock undervalued and purchased 1,946,765 shares at an average price of $9.62. We will continue to seek opportunities to deploy our free cash flow to augment shareholder returns. I will now hand the call over to Fritz.William Souder: Thank you, Robert. Despite macro headwinds in volatile public markets, we're staying in front of our LPs and GPs, deepening our relationships with them and listening for ways to continue to add value. Experience has taught us that during times of market uncertainty, investors may take longer to make allocation decisions and some fund closings may stretch out of it. However, it is important to remember a few driving factors that support our confident outlook. First, I think many of our LPs understand the value of vintage diversity, especially as it relates to our private equity and venture capital strategies. With long track records and excellent returns, we rely on a time-tested and disciplined investment process.Secondly, as we have entered the new year, we're seeing LPs generally more positive about their 2023 allocations. Some of this is related to the simple fact that 2022 is in the rearview mirror. And some of the optimism may be due to the reduction of the denominator effect as a result of the public markets lifting over the past few months. Finally, remember the catch-up fees are earned from investors that commit during the fundraising period of funds originally launched in prior periods. So a late fund allocation is not lost revenue, rather it is revenue realized in a later period. On the deployment side, we are selective and opportunistic in this current environment. Our GP stakes, NAV lending, venture debt and credit products, all benefit from a disciplined investment approach and can thrive in the current market.All of this gives us confidence in our ability to deliver continued organic growth. For 2023, we expect to have over a dozen funds in the market with cyclical and countercyclical products available to LPs to meet their investment objectives. We built solution lineup to surround GPs with market-leading products, ranging from credit to NAV lending and GP stakes. It means we have multiple ways to add value for existing clients while creating market space with new ones. As we think about the timing of expected fund launches, closes and deployments, this year's fee-paying AUM growth is likely more skewed to the second half of 2023. Over the past year, we have observed that LPs appear to favor more established managers, which we believe gives us advantage over our competitors.This benefit, coupled with terrific returns which you will see in our public filings, demonstrates that we are well positioned for continued growth. I will now turn the call over to Clark.background, modern, room,ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comClark Webb: Thank you, Fritz. As we reflect on 2022, it's an excellent time to remind shareholders why we believe we have a superior business model that uniquely positions P10 to take advantage of the secular tailwinds supporting private market demand. First and foremost, our business model is built upon long-term investment returns in asset classes that are difficult to access. With the P10 investment engine now covering lower and middle market private equity and private credit, venture equity and venture credit, middle market impact equity and impact credit and all supported by the leading lower middle market GP stakes franchise, we believe our investment engine is second to none. Across our traditional fund series alone, we have over a dozen strategies across 8 asset classes, with many flagship funds having a track record measured in multiple decades.At RCP, for example, we expect to launch Fund XVIII sometime in 2023. In short, we do not believe there is another investment manager out there offering institutional scale access to our verticals with the kind of long-term investment performance we exhibit. Next, we believe the P10 alignment is truly unique. We believe in a win-win-win: a win for P10 Fund LPs, a win for P10 shareholders and a win for P10 employees. As it relates to our LPs, our investment professionals personally put up the vast majority of the required GP commit and received virtually all of the carried interest. As it relates to stockholders, P10 insiders own more than 55% of the shares outstanding, and are committed to the long-term investment success of each strategy, given our significant GP co-investment and expected carried interest.And for P10 employees, we believe our platform is unique as evidenced by the unbanked off-market acquisitions of leading investment managers over the last 7 years at what we believe are meaningfully lower multiples than other public transactions. Finally, the combination of our investment manufacturing and peer-leading alignment results in a business model that we believe is second to none. Virtually all of our earnings are fee-related earnings with little tax leakage and no meaningful reinvestment requirements. In a year where many of our peers expect distributable earnings to decline and some meaningfully from 2021 levels, we expect double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted ANI. As a result of the confidence we have in our business model and our robust free cash generation, we have been taking advantage of the market sell-off to purchase P10 stock at what we believe is a material discount to intrinsic value.We believe shares purchased at recent levels will prove an excellent return on deployed capital over time. With that, let me hand the call over to Amanda.Amanda Coussens: Thank you, Clark. Fee-paying assets under management were $21.2 billion, a 23% increase on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter, $645 million of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by $89 million in stepdowns and expirations. For the first half of 2023, we expect $1.1 billion in stepdowns and expirations. This includes WTI's Fund VII which steps down in Q1. For the second half of 2023, we expect an additional $150 million. Stepdowns and expirations are a normal part of our business and typically take place at the end of a fund's life or when a fund has reduced fees after a period of full fees. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $58 million, a 28% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Year-over-year revenue increased from $151 million to $198 million for a 32% increase.Average fee rate in the fourth quarter was 115 basis points as the combination of WTI's higher fee rates on fee-paying AUM coincided with additional closings and our higher fee strategies during the quarter. We expect 2023 fee rate to normalize to 105 basis points as WTI's Fund VII rolls off and we have consistent closings across all of our strategies. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $53 million, a 57% increase over the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by additional compensation and benefits and noncash stock-based compensation expense related to the acquisitions of WTI, Bonaccord and Hark. For 2022, operating expenses were $155 million, a 41% increase over 2021. The fourth quarter was our first with WTI operating expenses consolidated in our financial reporting.GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $5 million, a 221% increase when compared to the year-ago period. The difference is primarily attributable to double-digit revenue growth and a reduction in interest expense. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP net income increased from $11 million to $29 million, a 173% increase. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $31 million, a 17% increase over what we reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the year, adjusted EBITDA grew from $83 million to $107 million, a 29% increase. We believe adjusted EBITDA growth of 29% in an otherwise difficult macro environment reflects the strength and durability of our business model. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 53%, and for the full year, it was 54% as WTI operates at a lower margin than the average of our other strategies.For 2023, when you take into consideration our implied WTI guidance that we provided last August, with Fund VII rolling off, we expect the combined P10 and WTI adjusted EBITDA margins to equate between 51% and 52%. This margin guidance reflects the full integration of WTI into the pre-existing P10 business model and the continued strong growth of our direct strategies which can carry a lower margin as they scale. We expect to maintain strong margins in 2023 while still hitting our $5 billion gross AUM goal and growing revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted ANI at double-digit rates on a year-over-year basis. Again, we believe double-digit expected growth should compare favorably to peers in a difficult environment. For the fourth quarter, adjusted net income, or ANI, was $27 million, a 24% increase over the $22 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.For the year, ANI increased from $63 million to $98 million for a 56% increase. Fully diluted ANI EPS on a year-over-year basis grew 43% to $0.80 per share, which puts us in the highest echelon of publicly traded asset managers. We continue to efficiently convert $1 of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net income due to small amounts of capital expenditures, cash interest and minimal tax leakage due to our tax assets. As a reminder, our tax assets are composed of 2 distinct assets: a $177 million net operating loss and $397 million in tax amortization. If you review our financial statements we posted today, you will note some additional state tax paid in the period. As we have expanded our footprint to California and New York, we expect to have about $4 million annually in state cash tax obligations.Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter were $20 million. At year-end, we had an outstanding debt balance of $293 million and $82 million available on the current credit facility. We also repurchased 1,946,765 shares of P10 stock in the fourth quarter. For 2022, we have repurchased 2,088,057 shares at an average price of $9.68 per share. We believe this represents an accretive use of capital given our view of the intrinsic value of the P10 franchise. We also continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share for Class A and Class B common stock. We have declared a dividend of $0.03 per share payable on March 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2023. Finally, at December 31, 2022, our Class A shares outstanding were 42,365,266 and Class B shares outstanding were 73,008,374 shares.I will now pass the call back to Robert for closing remarks.Robert Alpert: Thank you, Amanda.

I will now pass the call back to Robert for closing remarks.Robert Hudson AlpertThank you, Amanda. Now let's turn it over to the operator for a few questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Adam Beatty -- Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.Unidentified AnalystIt's Stuart here standing in for Mike. If I could just ask about fundraising really quickly. Could you just describe to us what you're hearing? I heard the -- I guess, the better mood music for '23. Which strategies, in particular, are resonating? Which strategies are (inaudible) a bit more cautious on? And generally, what's been the reception you're getting when you walk into these meetings?C. Clark WebbAbsolutely. Thanks for the question. Yes, so I would say a couple of things. First of all, we had a great Q4. It was not an easy Q4 as you can hear from many of our peers, but we still raised a good amount of capital, and it was actually very evenly spread across most of our strategies. So we are continuing to see nice interest in every single one of our strategies. We do have the benefit of having some strategies that are seen as more countercyclical. I would call out some of our credit strategies in particular. And so we do believe that we are getting the benefit of being able to lean in with some of our credit strategies. And then we have many that we feel like are just in a structural growth mode. I think folks have seen the success of our larger peers in GP stakes and how that business continues to institutionalize. And as everyone sees from the recent announcements, we think Bonaccord is the premier franchise in lower middle market GP stakes. And as such, given how large that market is, we continue to expect continuing interest there. So again, we built P10 with the opportunity to invest both in equity and credit across multiple asset classes. We have the benefit of being in the market with more than a dozen strategies. And I wouldn't say that one significantly outperforms the others. They're all gathering a significant amount of interest. But in particular, we have some of those countercyclical strategies and we have our GP stakes, which certainly is generating some nice interest.Unidentified AnalystGreat. And if I could just follow up with a question about Crossroads. I wondered if we can get an update there. I know it's been a little while since we talked about that. So anything you can share incremental?C. Clark WebbYes, we don't want to get out ahead of Crossroads. It is a listed company, and so we certainly won't share any material nonpublic news. That being said, I think what has been put out there is this is a relationship that has now generated a few hundred million dollars of fee-earning assets, and it is really proving the strength of the enhanced origination machine. And so I would certainly direct questions to Crossroads, but given where we started 18 months ago with a clean slate, now having hundreds of millions of dollars deployed at what we think are great returns, great risk-adjusted returns and really importantly, the impact that this portfolio generates, we think, is second to none. We are thrilled with how that's going.OperatorThe next question comes from Adam Beatty of UBS.Adam Quincy BeattyJust wanted to circle back on fundraising, maybe from a little bit of a different angle. Fritz talked a little bit about kind of the denominator effect may be going away at this point. So I just wanted to get your sense on, I know you've got a large number of LPs and potential LPs, so it may be difficult to generalize. But if you could, just in terms of the public markets and that backdrop, is flat from here combined with some reallocation, maybe a pause last year from LPs, is that enough to really offset that denominator effect, do you think, by middle or end of this year? Or do we need a little bit more of a market rally from here?William Fritz SouderYes, this is Fritz. I'll start it and then guys, jump in. But as you said, I think we've seen some pretty good movement here early in 2023. And so there's a clean slate for most of our institutional LPs to reinvest into '23. We definitely ran into some over-allocations in '22 towards the end of the year where they had to push us off to '23, where they had money to reinvest again. Whether we need uplift in the public markets to continue, it would be nice, certainly. But I do think that most of the clients that we're engaged with right now and talking to about investing in all of our sectors in '23, there seems to be a pretty clean slate, and I think you will see us continue. We've given the guidance of where we think we can be by the end of '23, and we're fairly confident that we will hit that guidance.Robert Hudson AlpertYes. No, I think Fritz has -- yes, I think Fritz has nailed it. It's never easy to raise capital even in the best of times. But with our strategies and our track records and the ability to raise capital across or through over a dozen different opportunity sets out there, we feel confident we ought to be able to make our fundraising numbers.Adam Quincy BeattyThat sounds pretty good. And then if I could, just a quick follow-up on some of your strategies that are geared towards sort of LP liquidity, thinking of secondaries and maybe NAV lending? And just how much of a tailwind you might be seeing in the current environment for those types of strategies?C. Clark WebbYes. I would say, in secondaries, the market was very GP-led secondary-focused over the last couple of years. And obviously, with the market downdraft, everyone is waiting for those 12/31 valuations. We expect to see more traditional LP-led secondaries in 2023. And thankfully, we've got a lot of dry powder in our fourth secondary fund and raising more. So we feel like we're going to be well positioned to take advantage of that. It does feel like that's more of a back half of the year than a front half of the year, but we are certainly starting to see that trickle out. On the NAV lending side, we think it's just a great time to be in NAV lending. Anytime you have velocity of transactions slow, yet you have vehicles that have paid a healthy multiple for businesses and need to continue to have add-on acquisitions. NAV lending is the tool that allows GPs to continue to extract value out of their portfolio. So we feel like we've got a great pipeline. We are fundraising for our fourth NAV lending fund as we speak. And it does feel like both of those strategies were able to lean in. I think another thing that we've announced is we have launched a Fund I in our venture secondaries. I know at least one of our peers has had a lot of success in venture secondaries. It is a newer market. But clearly, given everything folks have read in the venture world, we do believe that venture secondaries can actually be a third arrow in our quiver as we lean into some of this dislocation.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonI wanted to keep dancing around fundraising here. Given we witnessed LPs with less capacity to invest in later 2022, why do you see fundraising more back-end loaded for 2023? And what are the risks that we see sort of a repeat that the LPs, again, don't have the capacity towards the end of the year and where you're hoping to raise these assets, your LPs just have to further delay sort of contributing to your product?C. Clark WebbYes, it's a great question. I'm thinking -- go ahead, Fritz. You take it.William Fritz SouderYes. I was just going to say, it is a great question. One of the things I think you'll see, because we have such long track records, as Clark pointed out, RCP is about to launch Fund XVIII. It's a slow-moving ship with LPs. We are in the queue with a lot of them. They're maybe concentrating right now in the early about funds that are closing at Q1. But we can see pretty good throughout the year of where we are in the queue. And most of LPs, I would say, have us slotted in for some of the vintages. And so that's a little bit why you might see things in the later in the year. Most of our larger funds right now will probably be open throughout the calendar year of '23. And so that's one of the reasons why we're anticipating maybe a little stronger in the second half than in the first half, although we -- I think the first couple of months have been pretty good here. So we're excited.C. Clark WebbYes. And I would just add, P10, we are unique. Everyone thinks they're obviously unique, but we are pitching asset classes that historically are difficult to access and where we do feel like there's a great moat between our offering and other offerings. And so we are not -- many of our peers are able to raise an entire P10 in a week, but they're in large deep asset classes where there are multiple competitors. We really feel like we live in a world that, although smaller, we really do have more protected verticals. We really are the top player in these verticals. And to the extent that institutions are wanting to commit capital maybe for the first time to things like GP stakes and NAV lending, lower middle market private equity, venture capital, impact equity, venture credit, to the extent they are looking to commit those and those are more structural, less cyclical, we pop up as top of the list. And I know we haven't talked about it, but we are still, we believe, early innings on cross-sell. We do feel like if we can get in front of allocators, we have a very unique product offering with a great track record that has invested through many cycles. You think about our venture credit. We hope next year to be in a position to launch Fund XI, that's a 40-year track record with a lot of different cycles in that. I think we're able to gain confidence of the LP when they see the types of returns we've generated through cycles.Kenneth Brooks WorthingtonGreat. And this is a little bit longer-term thinking, but the fee rate, the stepdown that you sort of highlighted in the prepared remarks, to 105 as WTI's 7, I think, rolls off or steps down. As you think about Fund VIII sort of fundraising, should we start to think about 2024 with that fee rate kind of popping back up towards that 110 level as Fund VIII sort of gets fully raised? Or are there offsets to there where it will maybe creep up a little bit but won't get back to that 110 to 112 range?C. Clark WebbYes. We're -- we certainly appreciate the question. And giving guidance is something we always want to give guidepost, not get too far in front of our skis. But you're right. When you think about our fund, I think you meant Fund XI on venture credit. So Fund XI, presuming that does turn on in 2024, that is a higher fee product. So all things being equal, that would raise that average fee. That being said, we're constantly in the market discussing SMAs and things like that. And so you never know if we can land some other whales in the process. So what we like to do is give guidance for the year and then have additional puts and takes as the year progresses. But all things being equal, you're absolutely right, Fund XI is a much higher fee vehicle. And assuming that turns on in '24, that would raise the average fee rate. Again, I think it's really instructive that we did talk about 2 components of our long-term model. One is our fee rate, and we talked about how, given the fact that we did bring on WTI and given the fact that our direct strategies are growing faster than our fund of funds, we are having upward pressure on our fee rate, which is a wonderful thing. At the same time, our EBITDA margins will come down a bit because our direct businesses typically have a slightly lower margin profile. I think you can glean that from the guidance we gave when we did the WTI acquisition. And so given we do have things like NAV lending, impact credit, GP stakes and venture credits that are growing faster than P10 as a whole, it's that balance where we certainly are getting paid more on every fee-paying dollar, but we also are giving up a little bit of margin. And we feel like as we look at 2023, we talked about the AUM growth with reiterating our guidance. We've talked about in that 105 basis point range on fee rate and then that 51% to 52% on EBITDA margin. The good news is it produces double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA. And we feel like that's going to stack up well against pretty much everyone.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Brown of KBW.Michael C. BrownSo in your prepared remarks you talked about the share buybacks. And given the stock's cheap valuation here, it does sound like the share repurchases will be perhaps a preferred capital allocation avenue here. But M&amp;A is really core to P10's growth DNA. So how are you really balancing the two? What goes into that decision? And then in terms of acquisitions, how is that pipeline looking currently?Robert Hudson AlpertWell, I want to make sure the stock buyback is not necessarily our preferred capital allocation. It was -- the market gave us an opportunity to take advantage of very cheap -- what we perceived is a very cheap and good use of our capital. And in buying us and buying ourselves back, we made a great return on incremental capital investment. That being said, we have plenty of capacity and appetite for further partnerships with anyone out there. We have lots of conversations all the time. It takes a unique manager or strategy. One, we are focused on, as you well know, the lower middle market and middle market managers. They need to have superior long-term track records, and they need to not just be interested in taking money off the table -- they do that, they -- or selling out completely and going to the beach. So they really need to buy into and want to partner with us. And so that takes a unique -- we kiss a lot of frogs. And as you can see by our stable of strategies, we've been able to marry a lot of great folks.Michael C. BrownI guess just a follow-up on that point. You certainly now have a really full suite of capabilities across middle market private equity, lower middle market private credit, venture equity, GP stakes, now venture debt. So what should we think about as perhaps the next step for inorganic growth? Are there certain capabilities that fit your unique niche focus that you kind of think could be attractive on the P10 platform here? Anything that you could kind of point us to?Robert Hudson AlpertWell, there's always opportunity given the ability to scale credit and lots of unique niche ways in credit to deploy capital that wouldn't compete with what we already have today. So we're always looking at opportunities there. Clearly, there's geographic expansion, whether to Europe or Asia or Latin America around any of the strategies that we have existing. And then probably, then there's -- it's clear we don't have real estate or infrastructure. Real estate if we were going to move into real estate, that strategy would probably -- a real estate type strategy would probably make the most sense or be able to fit in well, the easiest if it was a credit-related real estate strategy, but we are open and have lots of dialogues with lots of folks. So -- but it has to be great long-term track records with a great opportunity to continue to grow and bolt on to and partner with us, and we can help them just like they will help all of us.OperatorThe next question comes from Ben Budish of Barclays.Benjamin Elliot BudishI wanted to kind of follow up on Ken's question from earlier about 2024. I know you gave guidance for '23, but last year, you kind of gave us a combined '22, '23 fundraising guide. And I'm wondering given the sort of momentum expected in the back half of this year and your optimism around some of those areas, are there any kind of early thoughts you can give on what 2024 might look like?C. Clark WebbI love that. This is a forward, forward guidance. This is great. Yes, so I think that other than saying we expect Fund XI from WTI in 2024 -- and you can see the cadence. If you look at our returns page which, again, we always encourage folks to go see, you can see kind of the differential in the cadence of launches. So you can kind of estimate when you think the next vintage is going to come about. But the only one we've specifically targeted is that Fund XI. I think beyond that, we're probably out kicking our coverage right now. Give us a couple of quarters, let us hit these targets first. And then I'm pretty sure we'll come out with something that talks about '24 and beyond.Benjamin Elliot BudishFair enough. And if I could maybe one more on just kind of guidance for this year. It seems like the EBITDA margin profile came in a bit lower than what we were expecting. Anything to call out there? I mean, you talked a little bit about sort of the mix shift and the sort of structurally lower margins at WTI. Is there anything else to keep in mind? And I guess kind of alongside that, is there any opportunity to increase WTI margins over time? Or are there sort of enough moving pieces that that's going to be hard to parse out on our end?C. Clark WebbYes. So it is absolutely related to the fact that we added a lower-margin business in WTI and the fact that our direct strategies are significantly outgrowing the business as a whole. And those do require more boots on the ground. We think that that's wonderful. These are high-fee paying, great strategies, and we think there's a lot of runway. But they are lower margin businesses. Do we think long term those margins can structurally increase? We certainly hope so. We think so. But as these businesses right now are growing faster than the enterprise as a whole, we think the 51% to 52% is the right way to look at it. And remember, WTI we don't expect to necessarily be in the market in '23. So we haven't talked about the incremental margins on a potential Fund XI as presumably that would hit 2024.Robert Hudson AlpertWe have better fee revenue on those products with lower margin, but the dollars continue to increase, and that's what we really care about.OperatorThe next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.Christoph M. KotowskiMost of mine have been asked. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the fee rate. I guess the prior guidance was always around 100 basis points, now is around 105. So presumably, the main difference is WTI, but you had -- historically, you had kind of indicated there was a bit of a seasonality with impact of boosting the fourth quarter and less in the early quarters of the year. Is that still there? Or is it by this point, given all that other strategies you've added so muted that it doesn't -- that there should be no seasonal pattern anymore?Amanda Nethery CoussensYes, there is still a seasonal pattern that we expect in the fourth quarter for the same reason. It's just not quite as impactful overall due to the additional strategies added.Christoph M. KotowskiOkay. And then just -- actually never mind, I'm all set.OperatorThe next question comes from John Campbell of Stephens.John Robert CampbellCongrats on a strong close to the year. And at the risk of beating a dead horse here, I wanted to touch one more on the fee rate. The 115 you guys reported, I think in the presentation, you highlighted maybe 110 bps as the pro forma metric. Is the difference there, is that just -- the $2.4 million, $2.5 million or so, is that catch-up fees?C. Clark WebbYes. So we had 3 different components in our Q4 fee rate. We certainly had catch-up fees, and I think we broke those out in the script, and we can come back to you on that as well. We had the WTI acquisition, which added that Fund VII which was still fee bank that rolls off at the beginning of this year. And so you'll see that, that's in that stepdowns and expirations. But that certainly helped us in Q4. Again, that steps down. And then the last is we do have our higher fee products are growing faster. Thankfully, we think all of our products are going to be growing nicely. And so we don't want to overestimate what the direct strategies will be, but they did have a very -- when you look at our Q4 fee-paying AUM growth, we saw a lot of impact from our impact credit, our NAV lending and our GP stakes, and that certainly had some upward pressure. Amanda, do you want to take the stepdown -- just reiterate the stepdown?Amanda Nethery CoussensSorry, I was actually -- I was going to add for catch-up fees, I don't think we had to step to. $1.5 million for the quarter, John, and $4.8 million for the year.John Robert CampbellOkay. That's helpful. And then back on WTI, you guys -- you talked pretty highly in the past around their loss rates and then basically having somewhat a degree of consistency there across various cycles. So maybe if you guys could talk to what you're seeing today, what you guys may be expecting, there's -- any expectation for a deviation if things get a little bit more dicey.C. Clark WebbYes, I'm certainly not going to be marketing the fund, although when I talk about it, it may sound like it. It's really extraordinary that over multiple decades through multiple cycles, including a cycle like 2000, 2001, which was pretty deep in the venture world, that loss rate has been incredibly stable at around 5%. It goes from high 3s to kind of low 6s and 7s. And again, we think that's comparable to the U.S. high-yield loss index. Meanwhile, the targeted returns here are very different than the targeted returns at high yield. So we think this product can really play an interesting role in institutional credit. Historically, the LP base has been much more venture-focused, but we think institutional credit allocators should really look at this because it does have an extraordinarily low loss profile given the return possibilities of the fund. And this cycle is no different thus far than any of the others. And again, that includes an awful cycle in 2000 and 2001. So we're very excited about this fund.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.Michael J. CyprysIf I could just piggyback on the venture question again. You talked at the time of the WTI acquisition about this being potentially a countercyclical product where you may have some firms that may not want to go back and raise equity right now. Just curious what you're seeing in the venture space at the moment. Is that thesis playing out? And also, what sort of -- what are you seeing on the demand side of this? Is this especially that people are still happy to allocate to you right now given what's happened to valuation over the past 12 months or so?C. Clark WebbYes. Great question. So I'm going to -- will answer it in a couple of different parts. In terms of the market, you absolutely have great venture-backed companies that rather than raise a down equity round are wanting to come and borrow from us. So that is a tailwind. You also -- it's interesting when you go through down cycles, the competitive environment can shift. We think it's shifting in our favor. WTI has a 40-year reputation that's been earned in good times and bad. They're a partner of choice, and it's times like this where that's really highlighted. And so I do think we have shots on goal that most others don't see. In terms of the LP demand, it is too early to tell. We are still deploying Fund X. We'll really get Fund XI going in the back half of the year in terms of preparing to launch that fund. So I would say too early to tell. That being said, given the opportunity set and given the 40-year history and given what we think are very unique risk-adjusted returns, we certainly can't wait to talk to folks about it.OperatorAnd with that, we will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to pass the conference back over to the management team for closing remarks.Robert Hudson AlpertThank you, everyone, for joining us. And any other follow-up questions or -- please reach out, and we'll talk to you next quarter.OperatorAnd with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.14%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.18%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.54%.Coming into today, shares of the equipment rental company had gained 4.36% in the past month. In that same time, the Construction sector lost 2.08%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.07%.United Rentals will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $7.93, up 38.39% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.09 billion, up 22.33% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $41.69 per share and revenue of $14 billion, which would represent changes of +28.28% and +20.25%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Rentals should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.07% higher. United Rentals is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that United Rentals has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.41 right now.

(NYSE: URI), the world’s largest equipment rental company, today announced it has surpassed 335,000 pieces of equipment outfitted with telematics technology in its rental fleet. The equipment includes aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment, generators, all-electric trucks, compressors, e-dumpsters, light towers and more.""Businesses face ever-increasing pressure to improve productivity and safety on jobsites. If they don’t have visibility to equipment operating on their sites, they could face cost or schedule overruns, as well as safety risks,"" said Tony Leopold, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Digital at United Rentals. ""Telematics technology generates valuable insights for our customers into the condition, utilization, location and performance of their rented and owned fleets. Our long-standing commitment to using data to improve the customer experience has led to this new milestone of 335,000 telematics-equipped fleet units, enhancing the value delivered by our rental offerings.""Telematics Helps Build a Smarter JobsiteIn a connected world, and on a connected jobsite, data is the key to working smarter. Telematics data in particular is critical for optimizing fleet strategies and working toward sustainability goals. Here are four ways that telematics solutions can improve productivity and safety on the jobsite:Improve Equipment Uptime. Telematics provides a rich set of diagnostic information, including critical fluid, fuel and battery levels, meter hours and other operating parameters. This information can ensure that equipment is ready for daily use, and can also be used to manage longer-cycle performance requirements, including regular preventative maintenance schedules, to keep equipment operating at peak performance. Real-time alerts such as emergency stop events, power load and diesel exhaust fluid levels help supervisors identify and respond to potential issues quickly, reducing downtime and keeping projects on track.Optimize Equipment Utilization. Tracking utilization of equipment on a jobsite is critical to ensuring that availability is properly balanced with overall project costs. Telematics technology can alert management if a machine is sitting idle for an extended period and incurring needless costs, while visibility into highly utilized assets can help keep workers productive by ensuring equipment is available for use when needed. Benchmarking reports can also provide visibility into how equipment efficiency compares to peers. By aggregating this information on easy-to-use desktop and mobile platforms, telematics provides access to these insights in the office or on the jobsite.Improve Worksite Safety and Security. On large and complex jobsites, telematics data is also essential for emerging safety and security technologies. The data can be used to manage access to equipment through Total Control®. Equipment access can be limited to authorized operators that have the required certifications and training. Location data, coupled with geofence technology and alerts, can help locate equipment quickly to lessen downtime and limit lost or stolen assets.Advance Sustainability Strategies. Telematics-enabled equipment generates data on engine usage, fuel type and more. This data can be used by worksite management software to evaluate the environmental footprint of equipment. The insights can inform decision-making, helping management determine the optimal fleet and utilization tradeoffs to decrease overall equipment emissions, advancing sustainability efforts.Story continuesUnited Rentals Telematics SolutionsUnited Rentals Total Control is a cloud-based worksite management solution that provides customers with holistic visibility into both rented and owned telematics-enabled equipment, ensuring equipment availability when and where it is needed. The utilization insight provided by Total Control identifies underutilized equipment to help customers improve efficiency and reduce costs.About United RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

Already private payroll and job opening data came out stronger than expected, giving the central bank the argument that it has to continue to move aggressively to tame inflation.Analysts expect the economy added 205,000 jobs last month, but they are also waiting to see if January's red-hot 517,000 number will be revised. On Wednesday, the Fed's Beige Book, which is a periodic survey of district banks about economic conditions, reported still-tight labor conditions across the country.Before that, Thursday features unemployment data for the prior week and Challenger's latest report on job cuts.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1.

TikTok will tighten access to user data in a process overseen by outside auditors as well as beef up privacy protection.TikTok is under pressure in Europe, where it has 150 million users, the U.S. and other countries that fear the app could pose risks to cybersecurity and data privacy. Western officials also worry that the Chinese government could use parent company ByteDance to push pro-Beijing narratives and misinformation.The European Union’s executive branch, parliament and council have ordered staff to delete TikTok’s app from devices used for official business, mirroring action by U.S. states, the federal government, Denmark’s defense minstry and Canada.A top EU official also has warned TikTok’s CEO that the company must comply with the bloc’s tough new regulations for online platforms.Bertram, the TikTok vice president, provided more details Wednesday on plans to localize data storage with servers based in Europe, where there are stringent rules on protecting user information. The new data centers will be operated by third-party service providers, which weren't identified.The tactic is similar to TikTok's approach in 2020 when it teamed up with database software company Oracle to avoid a U.S. ban from then-President Donald Trump's administration.TikTok will set up a second data center in Dublin and a third one in Norway's Hamar region, Bertram said. The company previously announced that it would open its first European data center in Ireland and said last month that it was adding two more, without providing details.Story continuesIn the U.S., TikTok routes all data to servers controlled by Oracle, though it's also storing backups on its own servers in the U.S. and Singapore. The company has said it expects to delete U.S. user data from its own servers but hasn't specified when.The new measures include “security gateways” to add an extra layer of control, determining whether company employees can access data on European TikTok users and whether the data can be transferred outside of Europe. A European security company will be appointed to audit the process, Bertram said.To improve privacy, the company will work with third parties, which it didn’t identify, to use technology that will make it harder to identify people from personal data.CEO Shou Zi Chew is set to testify next month before Congress, where U.S. lawmakers will grill him on privacy and data-security practices as well as TikTok's relationship with the Chinese government.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.39 billion, indicating 17.9% increase on a year-over-year basis.Oracle expects non-GAAP earnings per share) growth rate on a year-over-year basis in the range of 4-7% at cc and in the band of $1.17-$1.21 per share in USD.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at $1.19 per share in the past 30 days, suggesting a 5.31% increase from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Over the trailing four quarters, Oracle’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and missed the mark twice with the average surprise being 1.96%.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderAccelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter.The acquisition of Cerner earlier in 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, is expected to bolster the company’s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services.For the fiscal third quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency and from 43% to 47% in USD.Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL’s quarterly performance.On Jan 24, Oracle announced that it is introducing new logistics capabilities within Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain &amp; Manufacturing to increase the efficiency of global supply chains.The migration of several large-scale SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and increasing deal wins in several verticals, especially banking and healthcare, might have acted as tailwinds for the company’s ERP business.The robust adoption of Oracle’s next-generation Autonomous Database and Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud, supported by machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capabilities, might have benefited the top line. Autonomous Database in Gen2 public cloud infrastructure is witnessing healthy traction.The company’s latest Multiple-VM Autonomous Database on Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer service offering is gaining considerable traction among on-premises clients. Multiple-VM Autonomous Database enables organizations to create and run isolated, highly available Autonomous Database instances on Exadata Cloud@Customer systems that are also running non-autonomous Oracle databases.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Oracle this time.

A bout Rimini Street. Rimini Street is a global provider of end-to-end enterprise software support products and services. The company offers a comprehensive family of unified solutions to run, manage, support, customize, configure, connect, protect, monitor, and optimize client enterprise application database and technology software platforms. We founded Rimini Street in 2005 to disrupt and redefine the enterprise software support market by developing and delivering innovative new solutions that filled the then unmet need in the enterprise software market. We became and remained the leading independent software support provider for Oracle and SAP products based both on the number of active client supported and recognition by industry analyst firms.Story continuesOver the years has our reputation for technical capability, value, innovation, responsiveness, and trusted reliability grew. Clients and prospects began asking us to expand the scope of our support product and service offerings to meet other current and evolving needs and opportunities related to their enterprise software. We also heard from prospects and clients that their goals include reducing the number of IT vendors to more manageable numbers from a governance perspective with a desire to select vendors who can provide a wider scope of IT services and become true trusted partners. To meet the needs of our clients and prospects and to service what we believe is a significantly expanded addressable market opportunity, we designed, developed and are now delivering a new expanded solutions portfolio for a wider array of enterprise software and new solutions for application management, security interoperability, observability and consulting.We also now offer an integrated package of our services as Rimini one, a unique end-to-end turnkey outsourcing option for Oracle and SAP landscapes designed to optimize our client's existing technologies with a minimum 15 extended years of operating lifespan and enable our clients to focus their IT talent and budget on potentially higher value innovative projects that will support competitive advantage and growth. Q4 in fiscal year 2022 results, we believe the growing adoption of Rimini Street's expanded end-to-end enterprise software solutions is providing organizations the support products and services needed to meet their current and evolving needs around their enterprise software systems and delivering even more industry leading value ROI and engineering capability.We believe this was reflected in our record fourth quarter and full year revenue that exceeded guidance, multi-million dollar sales wins in diverse industries, strong subscription renewals and extensions, increased cross sales of our expanded portfolio solutions to existing clients and achievement of a 6% growth in our client base year-over-year to 3020 active clients. During the quarter, we continue to make investments and execute activities we believe will improve the effectiveness of our global marketing and sales execution as the pandemic era challenges continue to diminish and our sales opportunities and pipelines increase. We believe these investments and activities will lead to reacceleration of revenue growth and increased profitability over time.We also continued scaling up our global marketing and sales campaigns to reach a wider target of prospective clients who we believe can greatly benefit from our support products and services. Since our inception in 2005, we've signed and served over 5,000 clients, including more than 180 Fortune 500 and Fortune Global 100 companies. An estimate that we have helped our clients save more than $7 billion that they were able to add to cash or reinvest in their strategic priorities. Demand environment, organizations today need to figure out how to deliver both revenue growth and increased profitability. With our expanded portfolio of enterprise software support products and services, we now believe that any global organization with annual revenue or an operating budget of at least $200 million is very likely to have one or more opportunities for Rimini Street solutions.This is a significantly larger universe of prospective clients than Rimini Street historically targeted. As I previously noted in my 2022 earnings calls, the global macroeconomic environment forced organizations to re-plan, re-budget and reprioritize their IT strategy operations and staffing models. Clients and prospects needed to adjust their plans and strategies for a slower growth, higher cost environment that was going to likely last for years instead of months as originally thought post pandemic, the re-planning process froze and delayed IT and IT service procurement decisions and impacted 2022 sales for many technology companies including Rimini Street. However, in the fourth quarter, we began seeing clients and prospects complete their re-planning and REBUDGETING projects and moved forward with delayed IT and IT service procurements.Rimini Street benefited with completion of substantial contracting activity. We believe that Rimini Street is well positioned to meet the current and evolving needs of global organizations attempting to navigate the macro environment over the coming years. Surveys confirmed that we are seeing in buyer behavior needs and our opportunity. For example, Gartner recently cut their projection of 2023 global IT spend in half, and in a sponsored survey that can be found on our website, it was found that a substantial number of IT leaders feel pressure from their board of directors to show increased return on it spend, finding that a significant portion of the IT budget is allocated towards enterprise application software, which does not generate a meaningful increased return to the business.The survey confirms CIOs and CTOs are reviewing the total cost of ownership associated with their purchase and operation of enterprise applications. Even more telling a majority of the IT leaders surveyed seek to reduce the total cost of ownership for existing mature enterprise software by switching to third party support programs with almost half of participants looking to outsource support and maintenance services to free up their IT teams to work on more strategic, innovation focused projects in exact alignment with Rimini Street's vision and expanded portfolio of solutions. Sales execution; Fourth quarter sales deals included large support transaction wins against both SAP and Oracle. Significant AMS wins against IBM and other providers and sales across the full portfolio of solutions including security, interoperability, observability and professional services.Close rates on quarter opening pipe were healthy with strong close rates on proposals that continued to exceed 50% large deal execution was also healthy. Closing five deals with annual fees over $1million, an increase from the fourth quarter year-over-year, as I detailed on previous earnings calls since June of 2022, I have reallocated and dedicated a majority of my time to improving global marketing and sales execution, maturing our service offerings and delivering innovative new marketing campaigns to a wider target buyer profile in order to build bigger pipelines globally. We continued implementation of our successful cross sales strategies to guide and focus our hunter sellers on new client acquisitions to assure we have balance between new client sales and cross sales.As our go-to-market strategy matures for growth in both opportunities, we continue to make changes that improve global marketing of our broader service offerings. Ramped up a stronger global demand generation engine to accelerate pipeline growth and equipped our more than 300 global revenue team members with a greater set of lead and opportunity development and closing skills to reach even more clients and prospects. Our senior executives, including myself, continue our heavy travel to participate in a growing number of successful in-person Rimini Street and third party events and executive sales meetings with hundreds of current and prospective clients and collaborated with regional Rimini street management teams to set and hone the strategy for accelerated sales growth of our full portfolio of solutions.Oracle litigation update; Rimini Street and Oracle have been in litigation for more than 12 years. While the US courts have confirmed long ago that third party software support is legal. We presently have two active proceedings with Oracle, the injunction compliance dispute and Rimini two proceedings, both of which relate to the manner in which Rimini Street provides support services for certain Oracle product lines. Rimini Street is not prohibited from providing support or services for any Oracle products. With respect to the injunction compliance dispute, Rimini Street filed an appeal in 2022 to the Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals relating to certain rulings of the U.S District Court. Oral arguments on the appeal were held in San Francisco on February 6th, 2023, and the matter remains pending before the Court of Appeals.We believe we could have a ruling on the appeal in the second or third quarter of 2023, but the ruling could come earlier or later. With respect to Rimini II, two, the case Rimini Street filed against Oracle in 2014 and Oracle filed counterclaim on October 21st, 2022. Just days before the jury trial was set to begin, Oracle withdrew certain of its counterclaim and all of its claims against Rimini Street and against me personally as CEO for monetary relief of any kind under any legal theory in this litigation. Rimini Street's remaining claims in Oracle's remaining counterclaim seeking only equitable relief were tried before the court as a bench judge only trial that began November 29, 2022, and ended December 15, 2022. The parties submitted their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court on February 23, 2023, and the matter remains pending before the district court.We believe we could have a court verdict in the second or third quarter of 2023, but the verdict could come earlier or later. Please see our disclosures in the latest 10-K filing for additional information and disclosures regarding litigation with Oracle Summary. Over the past two years, we have placed the company in a materially stronger strategic position by achieving three key goals, strengthening the balance sheet to a series of key capital market transactions, delivering major wins in our protracted litigation with Oracle and successfully designing, developing, and launching an entire portfolio of new IT support product and service solutions. We remain confident that we are continuing to take the right actions and making the right investments to re-accelerate growth, increase profitability, and enhance shareholder value.Now, over to you Michael.softwarePhoto by Danial Igdery on UnsplashMichael Perica: Thank you Seth, and thank you for joining us everyone. Q4 in fiscal 2022 results, we were pleased with our improved Q4 performance and quarterly sequential billings growth in gross margin as well as maintaining a strong revenue retention rate on subscription revenue. Revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year 2022 was a record $108.6 million and $409.7 million respectively, a year-over-year increase of 9.4% for both periods. Clients within the United States represented 51.3% and 52.6% of total revenue for the fourth quarter in full year 2022 respectively. All international clients contributed 48.7% and 47.4% of total revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 respectively. Annualized recurring revenue was $420 million for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 6.9% revenue retention rate for service subscriptions, which makes up 98% of our revenue was 92% with more than 80% of subscription revenue, non-cancelable for at least 12 months.We note that for the full year 2022, our total revenue measures on a constant currency basis was negatively impacted by 1.5% due to FX movements. Billings for the fourth quarter were $160.4 million compared to $155.9 million for the prior year, fourth quarter, an increase of 2.9% year-over-year, and a substantial improvement from the prior quarters decline of 32.5%. As evidenced by the rebound in billings during the fourth quarter, we were pleased with our strong client renewal and expanding sales to existing and new clients. As Seth noted for the full year 2022 billings declined 2% year-over-year to $409.3 million. DSOs improved in the fourth quarter to 72 days a quarter-end compared to 83 days for the prior year, year-end 2021. This is a marked improvement from what we experienced during the first three quarters of 2022, where DSOs were lengthening.We believe the improvement underscores our strong client commitments to our offerings and thus experienced earlier than normal collections during our largest billings quarter of the year. Gross margin was 64.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 62.8% for full year 2022 compared to 65.1% of revenue for the prior year, fourth quarter, and 63.6% for prior year 2021. We do note the gross margin approved 300 basis points quarter over quarter and was in-line with our guidance reflecting our conscious decision in Q3 to ramp resources and talent that would allow for leverage in the fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation expense gross margin with 64.9% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 63.3% for full year 2022 compared to 65.5% of revenue for the prior year, fourth quarter in 63.9% for prior year 2021, the full year gross margin decline as a result of higher cost of labor, which has been successfully offset in part by our efforts to methodically expand efficiencies and leverage through technology process control and use of lower cost labor geographies.Looking forward for full year 2023, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62% of revenue on a GAAP basis and 61.6 to 62.6% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Operating expenses like other organizations globally, we are experiencing cost pressures due in large part to increase labor costs and inflation in all labor categories. To address this, during the first quarter of 2023, we implemented a restructuring with a reduction in forced offset, the increased costs, allowing us to maintain profitability and freeing up funds to target needed to drive growth. These initiatives, excluding the one-time charges, will result in approximately $15 million of annualized savings, sales, and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 36.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 34.9% for full year 2022 compared to 32.7% of revenue for the prior year, fourth quarter, and 34.3% for prior year 2021 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 35.4% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 34.1% for full year 2022 compared to 32% of revenue for the prior year, fourth quarter, and 33.5% for prior year 2021.We focused on making the appropriate investments needed to capitalize, honor our growth opportunities and thus see full year 2023 sales and marketing expenses to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5% on a GAAP basis, and 33.5% to 34.5% on a non-GAAP basis. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue excluding outside litigation costs was 16.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 18.4% for full year 2022 compared to 15.6% of revenue for the prior year, fourth quarter, and 17.1% for prior year 2021 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation expense, G&amp;A was 15.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 17% for full year 2022 compared to 14% of revenue for the prior year, fourth quarter, and 15.7% for prior year 2021.Outside of the onetime expenses that occurred in the period, the G&amp;A line continues to be higher our peers due in material part to the cost for in-house legal and compliance teams and other costs necessary made by our ongoing Oracle litigation and our conscious decision throughout 2022 to continue making investment in the systems, process and talent infrastructure needed to support our long-term growth objectives. Nonetheless, given that the majority of this investment is behind us and our aforementioned restructuring efforts, we see full year 2023 G&amp;A expenses declining as a percentage of revenue and thus to be in the range of 17% to 18% on a GAAP basis and 15.4% to 16.4% on a non-GAAP basis. Net outside litigation expense was $12.8 million for the fourth quarter and was $25.3 million for the full year 2022.This year's fourth quarter and full year 2022 had elevated costs due primarily to Oracle litigation costs from the Rimini II trial completed during December 2022. We had expected the trial to occur during fiscal year 2023 and we were required to move these costs into 2022. Accordingly, for full year 2023, we expect outside litigation expense to moderate to the $10 million level. Earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year 2022 were impacted by the elevated litigation expense and during the fourth quarter we also incurred lease impairment charges of $3 million and reorganization charges of $2.5 million. For the fourth quarter, the net loss attributable to shareholders was $5.3 million or negative $0.06 per diluted share and for the full year 2022 was a loss of $2.5 million or $0.03 negative per diluted share.On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fourth quarter was $15.3 million, while positive $0.17 per diluted share, and for the full year 2022 was $39.2 million or positive $0.44 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $18.3 million for the fourth quarter or 17% of revenue. And for the full year 2022 was $52.3 million or 13% of revenue compared to $19.3 million for the prior year fourth quarter and $55.8 million for the full year 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes outside litigation spend and stock-based compensation remained in the double digits at 14% of revenue for the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year 2022. Balance sheet; We ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $109 million, plus investments of $20 million, consisting of short-term treasuries and agency securities, bringing readily available cash to $129 million compared to $120 million for the prior fiscal year end.On a cash flow basis, for the fourth quarter, operating cash flow declined $1.9 million, and year-to-date, we generated $34.9 million compared to $19.1 million for the prior year fourth quarter and $56.9 million full year 2021. In addition to the FX headwinds noted that has impacted our cash flow, we have also experienced lower advanced payments for clients, both new and existing, as the overall inflationary environment is leading to a broad-based shift towards clients retaining cash for their own short-term investment opportunities and the presentation of cash. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, was approximately $300 million, unchanged from the prior year fourth quarter. Backlog, which includes the sum of billed deferred revenue and non-cancelable future revenue, was approximately $578 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to $593 million for the prior year fourth quarter.Capital Markets transactions. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased $4.7 million of our outstanding common stock with an average price of $5.56 per share and we reduced the principal balance on our term loan from $88 million to $78 million through amortization payments of $4.5 million and a voluntary principal payment of $5 million, resulting in a year-end net cash position of $51 million. Also relating to the term loan, during May of 2022, we swapped a floating rate of the term loan to a fixed rate of $40 million of a loan, and we are further offsetting debt service costs by investing excess cash at favorable short-term fixed income rates. In addition, we amended our credit facility in February 2023 to convert the loan reference interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR and amended the definition of consolidated EBITDA to provide an add-back of certain costs and legal fees.These actions reflect the strong support of our credit partners. Lastly, I would also like to note that on October 10, 2022, all 14.7 of the $11.50 exercise price warrants expired. Business outlook. We are currently providing first quarter 2023 revenue guidance to be in the range of $101 million to $103 million, full year 2023 revenue guidance to be in the range of $420 million to $430 million and full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to be in the range of $52 million to $58 million.

(MU) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-trending-140002417.html,1678284002,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -10.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has lost 10.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.65 per share, indicating a change of -130.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.28 points to a change of -127.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.77 indicates a change of +133.5% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -28.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $3.78 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -51.4%. The $16.22 billion and $22.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -47.3% and +39.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.07%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.12%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.47%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 9.02% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 3.15%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 2%.Micron will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be March 28, 2023. On that day, Micron is projected to report earnings of -$0.64 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 129.91%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.79 billion, down 51.33% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of -$2.22 per share and revenue of $16.27 billion, which would represent changes of -126.59% and -47.09%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Micron. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5.68% lower. Micron is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.The Semiconductor Memory industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 110, which puts it in the top 44% of all 250+ industries.Story continuesThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Make sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

599,0503c28d-6758-38a9-acc6-04cb1a9bd41f,MTD,2023-03-09,Mettler-Toledo (MTD) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mettler-toledo-mtd-incredible-growth-174505092.html,1678124705,STORY,['MTD'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Mettler-Toledo (MTD) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of precision instruments a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mettler-Toledo is 18.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.2%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Mettler-Toledo has an S/TA ratio of 1.16, which means that the company gets $1.16 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.73, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Mettler-Toledo looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.7% this year versus the industry average of 2.3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Mettler-Toledo. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.6% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Mettler-Toledo a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Mettler-Toledo well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

601,1f355477-d8d3-38f9-aa8c-f5eef45af2ae,FIS,2023-03-09,Shareholders in Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) are in the red if they invested three years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-fidelity-national-information-services-130018322.html,1678280418,STORY,['FIS'],"[If you love investing in stocks you're bound to buy some losers. But the long term shareholders of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) have had an unfortunate run in the last three years. Unfortunately, they have held through a 53% decline in the share price in that time. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 32% in the last year. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 14% in thirty days. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Fidelity National Information Services saw its share price decline over the three years in which its EPS also dropped, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Fidelity National Information Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Fidelity National Information Services, it has a TSR of -51% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Fidelity National Information Services shareholders are down 30% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.9%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Fidelity National Information Services , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Brands, Inc. YUM is witnessing growth trends courtesy of various approaches like robust digital initiatives, strategic unit expansion efforts, strong brand recognition and same-store sales growth. However, business withdrawal from Russia, inflationary pressures and supply chain risks hurt.Driving FactorsYum! Brands is witnessing top-line growth from implementing various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments that enhance the guest experience. The company’s digital initiatives like Dragontail Systems and Tictuk enhance customer ordering and food delivery, thus driving up sales.The company has been leveraging the power of its three most important brands — KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell — to drive long-term growth. It focuses on relentless unit growth of restaurants to drive incremental sales. The company is intensifying its focus on leveraging its scale and reinforcing the growth model by accelerating investments in digital technology to enhance customer experience and unit economics.The company is witnessing robust same-store sales growth. In 2022, worldwide systemwide same-store sales witnessed robust growth of 4%, subject to consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners. The company has been benefiting from a recovery in emerging markets. Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, the company anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.The company, which shares space with Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC, Jack in the Box Inc. JACK and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI is also focusing on expanding its footprint to drive growth. Despite unfavorable economic conditions, the company opened 571 gross new units at Pizza Hut, 997 gross new units at KFC and 496 gross new openings at Taco Bell during 2022. As of 2022-end, the company's total restaurant count was 55,361.Story continuesHeadwindsThe company’s growth has been adversely impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In 2022, the company ceased business at 1,112 units of KFC and 53 units of Pizza Hut in Russia. The business withdrawal from Russia incurred certain additional costs, which hurt the margins of the company.Also, certain additional costs due to inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, like an increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating costs such as rent and energy costs put significant pressure on the company’s margins.A Brief Review of the Other StocksYum China: The company has been benefiting from menu innovation, unit expansion and digitalization efforts. The company is gradually shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand its customer base. Its focus on logistics center openings and supply chain security bodes well. With a focus on improving customer experience and operating efficiency, the company started continued investments in this direction. Restaurant margin in fourth-quarter 2022 was 10.4%, up 290 basis points from the year-ago quarter’s levels. The growth was primarily the result of labor productivity, operational efficiency, temporary relief as well as initiatives to create a new base level for costs.Jack in the Box: The company is benefiting from its focus on menu innovation, delivery channels and marketing strategies. The company is investing aggressively in store improvements and new store build, innovating via digital operations. Moreover, it is using its digital platforms for enhancing overall guest experiences and customer satisfaction. In fourth-quarter 2022, comps at Jack in the Box’s stores increased 11.4% year over year against a decline of 4.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside in comps was primarily due to an increase in average checks, partially offset by a decline in traffic (for franchise).BJ's Restaurants: The company is benefiting from initiatives like menu innovations, an off-premise business model and unit expansion. Also, focus on Brewhouse Beer Club bodes well. The company is focused on creating more iconic brewhouse signature food and drink menu items to drive incremental visits and spending in its restaurants. Also, it emphasizes on refreshing its e-commerce platform with a modern user experience and advanced functionality.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Gallagher and Ryan Specialty Holdings",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-marsh-095309889.html,1678355589,STORY,"['AJG', 'MMC', 'AON', 'RYAN']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 9, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies MMC, Aon plc AON, Arthur J. Gallagher AJG and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. RYAN.Industry: Insurance BrokerageLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2062841/4-insurance-brokers-to-watch-despite-industry-challengesBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity.Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesGovernment initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players.Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #160, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, signifies bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are doubtful about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has moved down 2.4% since April 2022.Before we present a few insurance broker stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Both S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Insurance Brokerage industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the Zacks Finance Sector over the past year.The industry has risen 6.7% against the S&amp;P 500's decrease of 6.9% and the broader sector’s decline of 4.9% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.66X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.52X and the sector's 3.55X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 7.98X, as low as 4.22X and at the median of 5.98X.4 Insurance Brokerage Stocks to Keep an Eye OnWe are presenting two stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and two Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.

RYAN.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

""With more limited take rate upside and deteriorating buyer trends, we see downside to consensus from slowing top line and moderating margin expansion.""Colantuoni slashed his price target on Etsy to $85 from $150.

When times are difficult, however, many companies might cut or suspend their dividends.The best dividend stocks often have also increased their annual dividends through multiple market cycles including tough economic recessions.Many dividend stocks have faced fairly substantial headwinds in 2022 given the high inflation which has led to higher interest rates. With higher interest rates, U.S. Treasury yield have increased considerably. As of March 6, the U.S. 10 year Treasury bond has increased 224 basis points in one year to a yield of 3.98%.Given the U.S. 10 year Treasury bond's yield, Treasury bonds have higher yields than many blue chip dividend stocks even though Treasury bonds have substantially lower risk. As a result, considerable capital has flowed out of dividend stocks and the broader market and into the U.S. Treasuries. The capital outflow has led to some lower valuations for many blue chip dividend stocks as a result.Nevertheless, there is still hope that the Federal Reserve will win its fight against inflation in the next few years. If that happens, interest rates could decrease, and capital could flow back into blue chip dividend stocks, giving them potentially a better valuation.Story continuesFor those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.When it comes to dividend stocks, it could be a good idea to own blue chips since companies with fewer competitive advantages might not be able to sustain their dividends as well over the long term. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Software, Technology, ComputerPhoto by Luke Peters on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 13 stocks that paid dividends at least once a year that are regarded by many investors as blue chips.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.13 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

If you want to read about some more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.While we all might love the idea of investing in risk-free stocks, there's no such thing as a stock that's 100% safe. Even the best companies can face unexpected trouble, and it's common for even the most stable corporations to get shaken up due to significant price volatility. This was evident during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when many strong companies experienced dramatic drops in stock prices. More recently, we saw this phenomenon in 2022 when rising interest rates, inflation, and international conflict shook the stock market.Although 2023 started off on a decent note, the same can't be claimed for the rest of the year if Barclays Capital Inc.'s predictions are anything to go by. The investment advisory firm says that 2023 will go down as one of the worst for the world economy in four decades. Additionally, Ned Davis Research Inc. puts the odds of a severe global downturn at 65%. However, most investment firms agree that the year will be incredibly uneven, with Deutsche Bank AG seeing the S&amp;P 500 Index rising to about 4,500 in the first half, before falling 25% in the third quarter as a downturn bites — only to jump back up to 4,500 by end-2023 as certain investors tailgate a recovery.Long-term investors ignore the agitating, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwinds of uncertainty, they buy the shares of stable companies with reliable performance that’s measured in years, or even decades. Although still subject to volatility like every other stock, these recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In) include household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Story continues10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial StabilityPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of more than 940 hedge funds and picked the top 10 stocks that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The company’s systemwide sales rose 5% on a year-over-year basis, while its global comparable sales rose 10.9% year-over-year in 2022. Although the fast-food chain stated that the currency rate has been fluctuating quite a bit, it sees its FY23 capital expenditures to be around $2.2-$2.4 billion. Additionally, at the end of January, the company revealed plans to open 1900 new restaurants this year globally on a gross basis.On February 17, Loop Capital analyst Alton Stump maintained a Buy rating and $328 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in addition to raising his Q1 growth estimates in the U.S. to 7.5% from 5.5% and FY23 estimates to 4.9% from 4.4%.

Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 2 million shares worth $529.3 million.Much like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered a relatively safe bet.9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company offers more than 200 brands—from sodas to waters, from coffees to teas, from juices to kombuchas, and a growing list of flavored alcohol beverages — in more than 200 countries and territories .The beverage giant announced its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares February 15. According to the analyst, the company’s “robust” 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company’s 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 59 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, with 400 million shares.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage.

While he believes that renewables are the key driver of NEER's growth, he adds that other decarbonization-related verticals are emerging. Kalton maintained an Overweight rating on the shares of the company.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was popular among elite funds in Q4 2022, as 61 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.15 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”7. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT), compared to 68 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q4 2022 increased to $4.85 billion from $4 billion in Q3 2022.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the ""Costco Wholesale"" name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.On February 2, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $568 from $538 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Costco's January sales were ""solid"", and its extreme value proposition will enable the company to continue gaining more members and market share, particularly if the economy continues to soften.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $1.12 billion.Similar to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has historically provided investors with protection against market downturns.Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.  Suggested articles:10 High Growth AI Stocks To Buy11 High Growth IT Stocks to Buy10 Most Promising Blockchain StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For those of you interested, check out 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.When times are good, the profits of profitable companies could expand and management may decide to increase the dividend. When times are difficult, company profits could shrink or turn to losses and company management could decrease or even suspend the dividend.The best dividend stocks are arguably stocks with competitive advantages and a fairly long history of profitability and annual dividend increases through multiple market cycles including challenging recessions.

However, inflationary pressures, dismal China comps and high debt remain concerns.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversMcDonald’s believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding its presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance. Despite unfavorable scenario, the company continues to expand its global footprint.It is planning to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023, including 400 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,500(including nearly 900 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market. The company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute nearly 1.5% to 2023 systemwide sales growth in constant currencies.The company continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. In fourth-quarter 2022, global comps advanced 12.6%, while a gain of 12.3% was reported in the prior-year quarter. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of comps growth.In the fourth quarter, comps in the United States, international operated markets and international developmental licensed segment rose 10.3%, 12.6% and 16.5%, respectively. The company gained from robust performance in Japan and Brazil.The company, which share space with Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC, Jack in the Box Inc. JACK and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI is also focusing on menu innovation to drive growth. The company stated that it continues to witness positive momentum from the successful launch of Crispy Chicken Sandwich, as it launched McCrispy Chicken Sandwich in the UK in fourth- quarter 2022. The company also maintained leadership in France with its chicken McNuggets paired with trendy and unique sauces.The company has been testing automated order-taking in the drive-thru at several restaurants in the United States. McDonald’s continues to roll out mobile orders and pay, with a new curbside check-in option. The company has been focusing increasingly on delivery to provide enhanced experience and convenience to customers.MCD provides delivery in more than 100 countries. It has also reached new long-term strategic partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash for delivery. Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States. McDonald’s has 25,000-plus drive-thru locations worldwide.Story continuesConcernsThe persisting inflationary pressures are likely to hurt the company’s margins. Margins in fourth-quarter 2022 suffered due to significant levels of food and energy inflation in the Europe. The company expects to witness food and paper inflation in 2023 between mid to high single digits.Although overall comps have increased sharply, it is still far behind the pre-pandemic level in a few markets. In fourth-quarter 2022, comps in the China market were negative. Softening economy and COVID-related government restrictions have hurt comps in China.A Brief Review of the Other StocksYum China: The company has been benefiting from menu innovation, unit expansion and digitalization efforts. It is gradually shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand customer base. Also, focus on logistics center openings and supply-chain security bode well.With a focus on improving customer experience and operating efficiency, YUMC stated continued investments in this direction. Restaurant margin in fourth quarter 2022 was 10.4%, up 290 basis points from the year-ago quarter’s levels. The growth was primarily a result of labor productivity, operational efficiency, temporary relief as well as initiatives to create a new base level for costs.Jack in the Box: The company is benefitting from focus on menu innovations, delivery channels and marketing strategies. It is investing aggressively in store improvements and new store build, innovating via digital operations. Moreover, it is using its digital platforms for enhancing overall guest experiences and customer satisfaction.In the fourth quarter 2022, comps at JACK’s stores increased 11.4% year over year against a decline of 4.4% reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside in comps was primarily due to an increase in average checks partially offset by a decline in traffic (for franchise).BJ's Restaurants: The company is benefitting from initiatives like menu innovations, off-premise business model and unit expansion efforts. Also, focus on Brewhouse Beer Club bodes well.BJRI is focused on creating a more iconic brewhouse signature food and drink menu items to drive incremental visits and spending in its restaurants. Also, it emphasized on refreshing its e-commerce platform with a new modern user experience and advanced functionality.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move comes as part of the company’s acquisition-driven growth strategy.  Located at 42-11 9th Street, the industrial property comprises one industrial distribution building containing roughly 45,000 square feet on 1.1 acres. The property’s advantageous location — immediately adjacent to the Queensboro 59th Street Bridge connecting Manhattan and Queens — is likely to attract tenants. Currently, it is 100% leased on a short-term basis and the estimated stabilized cap rate is 5.2%.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. TRNO is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.Further, the company is targeting functional assets at in-fill locations. Such assets enjoy high-population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points.With such expansion efforts, Terreno Realty is well-poised to enhance its portfolio in six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, DC. These markets display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estate.Recently, Terreno Realty acquired an industrial property in Hialeah, FL, for $173.6 million. Located in Miami’s Countyline Corporate Park, the industrial property is next to TRNO’s seven fully leased buildings within Countyline. It comprises a 121-acre project entitled to 2.2 million square feet of industrial distribution buildings. The completion of the project is expected in 2025 and will have a total expected investment of $491.4 million.In the fourth quarter, TRNO acquired four properties, comprising three buildings encompassing roughly 65,000 square feet, and one improved land parcel of 2.8 acres for $59.4 million. For 2022, Terreno Realty’s acquisition activity included 20 properties. These comprised 17 buildings encompassing roughly 831,000 square feet, and 11 improved land parcels of 35.7 acres for $414.8 million.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, the industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including TRNO, Prologis PLD and First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Shares of Terreno Realty, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), have climbed 8.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.8%.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The strategy underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 3000 Index, in the fourth quarter.  In the quarter, the strategy gained in eight of the ten sectors it invested in on an absolute basis. Health care, financials, and IT sectors were the leading contributors while communication services and utility sectors detracted from the performance.

In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy highlighted stocks like Prologis, Inc.

One-month return of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) was -3.26%, and its shares lost 14.61% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Prologis, Inc.

(NYSE:PLD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Real estate holdings Equinix (EQIX) and Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) were standouts in a sector challenged by materially higher interest rates. Equinix is a best-in-class data center REIT with record leasing and backlog and a conservative balance sheet that should position it well in a downturn. Logistics real estate, meanwhile, has some of the most attractive market dynamics of all real estate subsectors, and Prologis is a clear leader within the group. Logistics real estate should continue to benefit from secular tailwinds of rising e-commerce penetration, ever faster delivery times, and supply chain resiliency (“just in case”).”Story continuesBiggest Logistics Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainPrologis, Inc.

The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Seagate Technology Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Is Seagate Technology Holdings Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.64% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Seagate Technology Holdings today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $56.68, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Seagate Technology Holdings’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Seagate Technology Holdings?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 86% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Seagate Technology Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? STX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on STX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Around 9 in 10 of these travelers (86%) plan to travel the same amount or more compared to last year, with this figure highest in the U.S. (94%) and lowest in the U.K. (81%).Inflationary pressures appear to have less impact on travel planning, when compared to data from previous editions of the Seasonal Travel Index. Almost two in five travelers (37%) intend to travel as planned between March and May 2023, despite rising living costs, versus less than a third (32%) between December 2022 and February 2023. For those intending to change travel plans due to rising prices this upcoming season, 31% will travel less or take shorter trips, while 27% will vacation closer to home.Consistent with previous Indexes, affordability (65%) remains nearly twice as important as other factors like trip length (35%) and trip type (31%) when planning a trip. Despite this, travelers look set to maintain travel spend this season, with half of travelers surveyed (50%) planning to spend more this upcoming season, compared to the same period last year, also broadly consistent with the previous edition.When it comes to destination planning, three in five travelers surveyed (59%) plan to travel domestically for their primary trip over the next three months, consistent with the previous Index. Roughly a third of global travelers surveyed (66%) plan to return to a place they've visited before, while only a third will visit somewhere new.Story continuesWith spring around the corner in the Northern Hemisphere, major cities - including Paris, London, New York and Rome - dominate the list of top global destinations between March and May. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australian travelers are looking to more sun-drenched destinations, with the majority of top ten international destinations located in Southeast Asia.In a trend that continues from previous Indexes, 13 of the top 15 fastest growing global destinations (those that have seen the largest year-on-year growth in hotel demand on Tripadvisor) are all based in Asia-Pacific countries, many of which have only recently reopened to international travelers or continued to loosen restrictions over the past 12 months.""As seen in previous editions of our Seasonal Travel Index, consumer appetite for travel remains strong as we head into the spring months in the Northern Hemisphere,"" said Alice Jong, Research and Insights Senior Analyst, Media at Tripadvisor.

Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, T. Rowe Price Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.22 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.88 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, T. Rowe Price Group has a trailing yield of 4.3% on the current stock price of $112.65. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. T. Rowe Price Group is paying out an acceptable 71% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see T.

In order to put this episode of high inflation behind us, further policy tightening, maintained for a longer time, will likely be necessary.""If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much further, the economy could slow or even enter into a recession. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingPhoto by floriane vita on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 14 American stocks with competitive advantages that have dividend growth potential in the future.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now14.

629,f1e4c250-e7b9-3af7-bd5c-31f3f9167a20,TROW,2023-03-09,Is T. Rowe Price Science & Technology Fund (PRSCX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-science-technology-120012291.html,1678104012,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TROW']","[There are plenty of choices in the Mutual Fund Equity Report category, but where should you start your research? Well, one fund that might be worth investigating is T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology Fund (PRSCX). PRSCX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerPRSCX is a part of the T. Rowe Price family of funds, a company based out of Baltimore, MD. Since T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology Fund made its debut in September of 1987, PRSCX has garnered more than $3.63 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Kennard W. Allen who has been in charge of the fund since January of 2009.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 7.85%, and is in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 4.83%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. PRSCX's standard deviation over the past three years is 26.03% compared to the category average of 20.6%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 23.49% compared to the category average of 18.25%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.08, which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -1.29, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, PRSCX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.84% compared to the category average of 1.30%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, PRSCX is actually cheaper than its peers.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology Fund ( PRSCX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, worse downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology Fund ( PRSCX ) looks like a great potential choice for investors right now.Don't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds.

630,a31b5c83-8c35-3bc8-9207-f9dedda03efb,UPS,2023-03-09,FedEx (FDX) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-fdx-report-q3-earnings-100610460.html,1678356370,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS']","[FedEx Corporation FDX is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Feb 28) results on Mar 16, after market close.FDX has a disappointing surprise record with its earnings per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the preceding four quarters while missing thrice. The average beat is 1.33%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised 2.94% downward in the past 60 days.Against this backdrop, let’s look into the factors that are likely to have impacted FedEx’s to-be-reported quarter’s performance.Akin to fiscal second quarter, we expect persistent demand weakness, especially at FedEx Express, to have dented performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, macroeconomic weakness in Asia and service challenges in Europe are likely to affect the results of this segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for segmental revenues suggests a 7.4% decline from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. Our estimate indicates a decline of 6.1% year over year.Increased purchased transportation rates and lower package volume are likely to have affected the quarterly performance of the FedEx Ground segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues suggests a 1.3% decline from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. Our estimate indicates a decline of 3.7% year over year.Softness pertaining to average daily shipments are likely to have hurt performance of the FedEx Freight segment as well.However, increased fuel surcharge and the cost-control actions are likely to have aided FDX’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FedEx this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of -1.41% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.61, 3 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for United Parcel Service:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.26 = US$14b ÷ (US$71b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 26%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From United Parcel Service's ROCE Trend?United Parcel Service deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 26% and the business has deployed 62% more capital into its operations. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If United Parcel Service can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.The Bottom Line On United Parcel Service's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that United Parcel Service has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOne more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with United Parcel Service (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

634,c5d413a9-d29e-3649-9b55-86e2b6be984b,UPS,2023-03-09,3 Stocks That BlackRock Is Betting On Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-blackrock-betting-now-164938465.html,1678034978,STORY,"['BLK', 'UPS', 'BIDU', 'SNOW']","[BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is the world’s largest asset management company, with $8.6 trillion in assets by the end of 2022. The company is well known for its prudent investment decisions and has accumulated this colossal amount of assets despite being around for only 35 years. At its peak last year, BlackRock’s AUM surpassed $10 trillion before market headwinds started to weigh in. BlackRock released its 13F filing last month, which lets us look into the stocks the company is bullish or bearish on. The firm has highly experienced experts that determine the picks, and considering the performance so far, I’m confident the following three BlackRock stocks will do well as we advance:SNOWSnowflake$142.11UPSUPS.$185.68BIDUBaidu$153.46Snowflake (SNOW)The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW IPO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) has gained significant attention from Wall Street due to its impressive revenue growth and partnerships with major tech companies. However, its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday provided underwhelming guidance due to slowing growth in the cloud industry. The company expects product revenue of $2.7 billion, up 40% in its fiscal year ending on Jan. 31, 2024. That’s slightly less than Wall Street’s $2.93 billion estimate. The subsequent punishment has caused the stock to lose around 13% of its value, now trading in the $135 range.BlackRock is among the most bullish on the stock and acquired 2,569,953 shares of SNOW in Q3, a 25.7% increase, taking its total to 12,567,822. These purchases were when the stock’s value was much higher, and the current drop provides an excellent time to snap up more SNOW stock. Sure, the guidance did miss the Street’s expectations, but the disappointment has been priced in, and that’s still a healthy 40% growth this year. Q4 revenue was also higher, and losses were lower than expectations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesFurthermore, Snowflake’s partnerships with major tech companies, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), could also contribute to its growth down the line. The company has integrated its platform with these tech giants, allowing users to use Snowflake’s services on their cloud platforms seamlessly.UPS (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockUPS (NYSE:UPS) is a cash-generating machine and is up nearly 60% from the pre-pandemic period and continues to grow despite headwinds. Despite all this growth, its forward price-earnings ratio of 16 remains very appealing.BlackRock increased its position in UPS by 11.15% from last year, taking its ownership of the company to 7.9%. Last year, the company’s revenue grew 3.1% to $100.3 billion, with operating profits of $13.1 billion, up 5.4%.For 2023, UPS expects revenue to be between $97.0 billion and $99.4 billion and a consolidated adjusted operating margin of between 12.8% and 13.6%. That could lead to a slight decline in its price, but the company is well on track to keep growing in the long run.UPS also stands to benefit from the current global supply chain disruptions, as the company’s expertise in logistics and supply chain management makes it well-positioned to navigate these challenges. As consumers increasingly turn to online shopping and same-day delivery options, UPS is poised to capitalize on these trends and continue its strong growth trajectory. Thus, with a 3.51% yield to sweeten the deal, it’s one of the long-term BlackRock investments.Baidu (BIDU)keyboard with the enter key replaced with ""ecommerce"" and colored like the chinese flagSource: ShutterstockBlackRock has also significantly increased its position in Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock, showing strong support for the Chinese tech giant. Baidu, often called the “Google of China,” is a leading search engine and artificial intelligence company expanding its offerings in areas such as cloud computing and autonomous driving.As my colleague, Eddie Pan reported, BlackRock acquired 148.72 million shares in just Q4, up from just 1.6 million as of Q3. Shares of BIDU have been surging after its announcement of “Ernie,” a ChatGPT-style bot that’ll be made public after internal testing in March. Of course, there are concerns over regulatory challenges facing Chinese tech companies, but Baidu’s solid financials and growth prospects continue to make it an attractive investment option. With BlackRock increasing its position in the company, it’s clear that many investors share this sentiment.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Powell categorically stated that the Fed might apply bigger interest rate hikes if future economic reports suggest strong measures to control price pressures.The remarks followed hotter-than-expected inflation in January amid an unexpected increase in job additions for the month. January’s consumer price index increased by 0.5% month over month and notched an annual gain of 6.4%, topping analysts’ forecast of an increase of 0.4% and 6.2%, respectively, according to the Labor Department. At the same time, 517,000 new jobs were added in January, topping expectations of 187,000 job gains. The unemployment rate too fell to 3.4% in January, its lowest since 1969.Now, with the employment report remaining astounding all around, consumer outlays are poised to improve, leading to more price pressures. So, the Fed is expected to remain aggressive in its monetary policy stance.Following Powell’s hawkish comment, market participants, too, are expecting a 70% chance of a 50-basis point rate hike in March, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Notably, before Powell’s remarks, only 30% of Fed funds futures traders had expected a half-percentage point increase in interest rates this month.Such a rate hike will easily push the policy rate to around 5.5% by mid-summer, and analysts expect the rates to remain at this level for the rest of the year. However, a hawkish interest rate environment does not bode well for the stock market as it impacts consumer spending habits and dampens economic growth. That is why Powell’s hawkish tone flared up volatility.The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 registered their worst trading day in the last two weeks on Feb 7, following Powell’s remarks on rate hikes. But investors should not stress out! They should instead place their bets on stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns or are perceived to be safe investments. Notable among them are Unitil UTL, Xcel Energy XEL, NiSource NI, Clorox CLX and Ingredion INGR.Story continuesThis is because these stocks belong to the defensive sector, including consumer staples and utilities, or in other words, they are non-cyclical in nature and remain unfazed by market upheavals. Such stocks are also dividend payers, indicating a sound business model that can easily counter any market volatility.

ZBH is gaining from an ongoing business recovery. The company has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. However, consistent foreign exchange woes and stiff competition do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 8.2% against 37.3% fall in the industry and a 5.3% decline in the S&amp;P 500.The renowned musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $26.51 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 6.2% compared with the industry’s growth projection of 14.3%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayQ4 Upsides: Zimmer Biomet ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of the company’s geographic segments and product divisions recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER. Even amid the challenging macroeconomic conditions, expansion in the company’s adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging. The company registered strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in the knee and hip businesses. The U.S. business saw strength across the three priority areas within SET.Business Recovery Continues: Zimmer Biomet is witnessing a rebound in its business in the past few quarters despite macroeconomic challenges.In the fourth quarter, U.S. sales rose 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in Zimmer Biomet’s Knee and Hip businesses. The global knees business increased 10.2%, with U.S. knees up 10.8% and international knees up 9.3%, with strong performance driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside the United States. Global hips increased 8.4%, with U.S. hips up 9.5% and international hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the United States.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesGradually Stabilizing Market: Despite challenging market conditions in the form of pricing pressure, the last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume.In line with this, during the fourth quarter earnings update, the company noted that it witnessed better than expected growth driven by continued procedure recovery, strong execution, and a solid momentum with the innovation and also benefited from some favorable comps in the quarter. The company saw another positive quarter of year-over-year momentum in large joints, with the overall global hip and knee business growing more than 8% and 10%, excluding foreign exchange.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is highly competitive with players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. Zimmer Biomet must constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Exposed to Currency Movement: Zimmer Biomet records a significant portion of its sales from the international market. This makes it highly exposed to currency fluctuations.Estimate TrendZimmer Biomet has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 203 earnings has moved 1.4% north to $7.04.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.13 billion, suggesting a 2.7% fall from the 2022 reported number.Key PicksFew other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector includeHaemonetics Corporation HAE, TerrAscend Corp.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode According To Hedge Funds.BofA's Small/Mid-Cap Strategist Expects ""More Downside Risk To Earnings Forecasts""On February 25 BofA's head of U.S. small/mid-cap strategy, Jill Carey Hall, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss her market outlook and areas of the market she likes. Hall said she was expecting ""a bounce"" coming into 2023, ""given just how negative sentiment had been"" at the end of 2022. Hall revealed that her year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4000. However, she thinks ""there's more potential downside risk"" since a lot of indicators she looks at that could ""signal a potential bottom in the market haven't been hit yet"". Hall sees markets being volatile in 2023 and noted that there are ""better opportunities in spots of the market"" one of which was small-cap stocks.Hall thinks the U.S. will enter a ""mild recession"" in the second half of 2023, that will ""last into early next year (2024)"". Hall noted that ""usually, S&amp;P earnings declined about 20% during an average recession"" and her estimates for earnings declines are ""less than half of that"". Hall said that though ""there has been strength in the data"", ""earnings have generally been in-line to a slight miss"". Hall thinks ""there's more downside risk to earnings forecasts"" but she does not think it would be ""as dramatic as we usually see during a recession"". Hall later discussed the ""spots of the market"" she likes. Here are some comments from Jill Carey Hall:""When you look at what's priced in already, how positioning is, you get some different results than the typical recessionary playbook. Also when you look at the shifting risk profiles of sectors, some of the traditionally safer low-beta sectors have actually become higher beta and vice versa. So we're overweight some of the more cyclical sectors right now. Energy, materials, financials, and then we're overweight staples, that's sort of our preferred high-quality defensive sector.""Story continuesAs of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.79% year to date, the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.54% since the beginning of the year, and the Russell 2000 is up 10.14% for the year.

While we think the brand has enormous global value and appeal, the Achilles heel has always been the existence of voting control stock that enables the founding family to essentially run this like a captive weekend lemonade stand with all that attendant discipline to cost and interest in shareholder returns. We generated a solid return in the name but have difficulty seeing an interest in a path that raises margins 50% which would still put them below their peers. We think we can do better.”13.

For more companies, head on over to 10 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World. The software as a service (SaaS) industry is one of the hottest sectors in the technology sector right now. The growth of the Internet and connectivity in general has created new business models and allowed existing businesses to transform their operations and take advantage of external products and processes without having to deal with large capital investment for their own systems. This allows firms to streamline their daily processes such as human resources and payroll and take advantage of specialized services. At the same time, it generates new business models where entire businesses are set up to facilitate other businesses or professionals at carrying out their operations.These diverse use cases and the fact that the industry itself still hasn't fully matured lead to some optimistic valuations and growth estimates for the SaaS sector. One such estimate comes from Market Research Future, with the firm estimating that the SaaS industry is estimated to grow to $381 billion by the end of this decade from the start and through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3%. This growth and the strong valuation for a software subscription platform that does not have the luxury of high product prices like the hardware industry does is still unsurprising given that some of the biggest technology companies in the world such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) have dedicated cloud computing divisions. This growth is also fueled by the relatively easier adaptability of the SaaS platforms, as Market Research Future points out that firms find it easier to access complex software products via the cloud instead of spending heavily to develop such capabilities in house.Another more optimistic estimate for the SaaS industry comes from FinancialNewsMedia. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $121 billion in 2020 and from then until it will grow at a stronger CAGR of 18.8% to be worth $702 billion by the end of 2023.Story continuesHowever, despite these rosy estimates, the SaaS sector is still a technology industry and as such is subject to macroeconomic pitfalls. These days inflation and high interest rates are restricting corporate budgets and cloud computing spending is also dropping as a result. Yet, SaaS companies are adamant that their business is growing, with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s chief executive officer Mr. William McDermott highlighting during a recent earnings call that:C-level buyers don’t want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, “We can’t afford 1,000 points of We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.” So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow. This begins with our business model. ServiceNow with born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world.Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation. . . . .Right now, many technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest SaaS companies in the world, out of which the top picks are Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Adobe Inc.

These were somewhat offset by increased marketing and selling expenses, adjusted other cost and adjusted administrative expenses.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisMeals &amp; Beverages: Net sales increased 10% year over year to $1,408 million. Organic sales rose 11%, mainly due to a rise in U.S. retail products that include U.S. soup, Pace Mexican sauces and Prego pasta sauces and benefits from foodservice.

Operating earnings in the unit jumped 17%.Snacks: Net sales in the division rose 15% (also organically) to $1,077 million. The upside can be attributed to sales of power brands which rose 20%.

As a new step forward, we are thrilled to announce a significant investment in renewable energy produced by photovoltaic power plants in Poland, a substantial contribution to this long-term goal.In fact, we have signed in Poland a 12-year Virtual Power Purchase Agreement with GoldenPeaks Capital, a Swiss company investing into renewable energy sources across Europe. GoldenPeaks Capital will supply approximately 126 gigawatt hours of carbon free, renewable electricity on a yearly basis, produced by various solar power plants in Poland with a contracted peak capacity of 109 megawatts.This agreement aims to save more than 1 million metric ton equivalent of CO2 during its agreed tenor. It will approximately offset the electricity-related carbon footprint of eight Mondelēz International plants in Poland, including sites in Plonsk, Tomaszow Mazowiecki, Jankowice, Jaroslaw, Bielany Wroclawskie, Cieszyn and Skarbimierz. The energy production is planned to start in March 2023.Roman Sitko, President of the Board, Mondelez Polska Production said, ""We are proud that MDLZ invests in renewable energy in Poland. It will not only accelerate our existing efforts to reduce our emissions footprint in local supply chain across eight plants but also help to create a more sustainable snacking company.""""Cooperation with GoldenPeaks Capital in Poland is a great proof point that we are transforming how we do business across our operations towards more sustainable future,"" added Marcin Dobrock, Senior Managing Director, Poland and Baltics. ""I am proud that our consumers, when buying their favorite brands produced locally like Milka, Prince Polo, Delicje, San or Lubisie, can be sure that they have been produced with care for the environment.""This is a positive, big step forward in our ambition to build a more sustainable snacking company.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mondelēz International on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Mondelēz InternationalWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mondelez-international Email: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Mondelēz InternationalView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742311/Investing-in-Renewable-Energy-in-Poland]"

The country is well known for luxury goods such as watches and knives, and lawmakers said they had to defend that reputation from misuse.In order to qualify as Swiss-made, food products must source at least 80% of raw materials domestically.Italy, which holds the southern portion of the Matterhorn, has been quiet about the use of the image, as well as the name Toblerone, which the company says is a play on the name of the founder, Theodor Tobler, and the word torrone, meaning “nougat,” in Italian.Mondelez announced the new packaging will feature a “modernized and streamlined mountain logo that aligns with the geometric and triangular aesthetic,” but the company has yet to release any images.

When it comes to foods, two criteria have to be met: At least four-fifths of the raw materials that go into the product have to come from Switzerland, and the processing that gives a product its “essential characteristics” must be carried out in Switzerland.The chocolate bar, made of honey and almond nougat, is distinctive for its triangular “peak” shape that evokes a mountain range and matching triangular packaging — sold in scores of countries and duty-free shops around the globe.Toblerone has already been produced in other countries — notably late into the last century. The treat was invented 115 years ago by Swiss confectioner Theodor Tobler, with the brand name a fusion of the family name and the Italian word “torrone” — nougat.Mondelez has already run into blowback from its changes to Toblerone in the past: A move years ago to widen the gaps between the chocolate peaks — reducing the weight of the bars but keeping the price the same, known as “shrinkflation” — fanned outrage in Britain, where the change mostly took effect.]"

That said, perspective is essential. From April 2020 to March 2022, oil prices went on one of its most breathtaking advances ever, from $6.50 to $130 a barrel. The hike in oil prices over the past few years can be attributed to several different factors, including:·      Supply &amp; Demand Imbalances: Production cuts from OPEC and a recovering Asia Pacific economy has caused the imbalances seen today.·      Geopolitical Turmoil: The War in Ukraine and tensions between the United States and Iran are playing a factor in keeping inflating oil prices.·      Environmental Policy: A push by global governments to reduce carbon emissions is increasing the cost of production and consumption, leading to higher prices.Have Oil Stocks Come Too Far?The ranges in crude oil prices and oil-related stocks have shrunk dramatically over the past few months. Often, a contraction in prices leads to expansion. With that in mind, the current tug-of -war between bulls and bears will likely be resolved soon. Below are 3 reasons oil stocks are set to move higher in 2023:1.   Valuations are Reasonable: While oil prices have gone on a dramatic run over the past few years, valuations remain attractive relatively speaking. Oil giants such as Halliburton, Chevron and Exxon Mobil are trading at PE ratios well below that of the S&amp;P 500 Index. For example, Exxon trades at ~8x earnings while the S&amp;P 500 Index trades at 18x.2.   Earnings Surprise History: Though higher crude oil prices have meant higher earnings expectations, many oil companies are still jumping over the expectation hurdle. For example, Argentine oil producer YPF Sociedad Anonima has crushed earnings on average by an eye-popping 146.77%!Story continues3.   Institutional Conviction: On Monday, a recent SEC filing divulged that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathawaysnapped up 5.8 million more shares of Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire’s total number of shares owned is around 200 million, equating to ownership of roughly 22% of the company.Bottom LineWhile oil has digested its gains thus far in 2023, several factors suggest that the run in oil stocks may not be over. First, environmental policy, geopolitical turmoil, and supply and demand imbalances are likely to remain stagnant for the foreseeable future. Secondly, strong growth, coupled with reasonable valuations and institutional backing should lead to higher prices for the remainder of 2023.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

However, he suggested that the next rate hike decision hinges on data to be issued before the Fed's March meeting.Stocks had fallen more than 1% on Tuesday after Powell's comments led investors to dramatically increase bets on a 50-basis-point hike in March compared with the previous widely held expectation for a 25-basis-point hike before Powell spoke.Data released on Wednesday did little to ease concerns about higher rates as it showed that U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in February.Another report showed U.S. job openings fell less than expected in January and data for the prior month was revised higher, pointing to persistently tight labor market conditions fueling concerns that this would keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates for longer.""Investors are digesting Fed Chair Powell's testimony to Congress and data indicating that the job market remains pretty hot,"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, in Minneapolis.Hainlin sees Friday's non-farm payroll report and next week's inflation readings for February as the keys to whether the next rate hike will be 25 or 50 basis points.Story continuesTraders kept increasing bets for a Fed rate hike of 50 basis points later this month, with fed funds futures recently showing a roughly 80% chance for such a hike, up from about 70% on Tuesday and 31% on Monday before Powell's first testimony, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.At the end of the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 58.06 points, or 0.18%, to 32,798.4; the S&amp;P 500 closed up 5.64 points, or 0.14%, at 3,992.01; and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.67 points, or 0.4%, to end at 11,576.00.Among the S&amp;P's 11 major sectors, seven closed higher.

But in a second day of testimony to Congress on Wednesday, the policymaker did not commit to a widely expected 50 basis point rate hike in March.Powell said the Fed had not yet made a call on the size of the rate increase, suggesting that would depend on economic data.Data released on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in February, pointing to a strong labor market ahead of Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report.The U.S. jobs report showed openings decreased to 10.82 million in January, hotter than economists' expectations for 10.5 million, and data for the prior month was revised higher. Layoffs rose in January and job cuts were higher than initially thought in 2022 while fewer people voluntarily quit their jobs.""We received very little definitive guidance today from the numbers and Powell was kind of neutral, reinforcing that he's data dependent,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.So with very clear economic guidance to change investors' minds ahead of Friday's jobs report, ""nobody wants to take particularly large bets before the payroll numbers and the inflation numbers,"" Phipps said.Traders kept increasing bets for a U.S. central bank rate hike of 50 basis points later this month, with fed funds futures most recently showing a roughly 80% chance for such a hike, up from about 70% on Tuesday and 31% on Monday before Powell's first testimony, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 158.3 points, or 0.48%, to 32,698.16; the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.8 points, or 0.17%, at 3,979.57; and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.43 points, or 0.08%, at 11,539.76.Among the S&amp;P's 11 major sectors, six were in the red with energy falling most, down 1.3%.

I've been mulling over this question to recognize the theme of this year's International Women's Day: Embrace Equity. I'm passionate about cultivating healthy, vibrant culture, and so I was intrigued to reflect on how leaders can grow a culture where inclusion and equity are engrained in its soil. Three specific moments came to mind.Moment #1: Embracing my ""otherness""During the height of the pandemic in 2020, I happened to be the only parent on the Boston Scientific executive committee with young kids at home. I found that I was that voice constantly reminding the team about the challenging and often harrowing realities of our employees who were expected to manage work, their kids' school closures and distance learning - all at the same time.I must admit that at the beginning, I felt uncomfortable being ""the other"" and ""the only,"" as I had just joined the executive committee. Then I started to realize the impact I was making by being open and vulnerable on this topic, which allowed me to embrace my ""otherness"" instead of trying to downplay it or pretend that I had it all together as a working parent.As a result, I became a trusted ear and voice for working parents and was able to better convey the struggles that many of our employees were experiencing. This opened the door for more dialogue, more understanding and much greater empathy in that team, which positively impacted how we navigated the pandemic with and for our employees.Key learning: Vulnerability opens the door for more authenticity and trust for positive change to happen.Moment #2: Equity is not a zero-sum gameI was holding a reverse mentoring session with a group of our first-line managers, all of whom happened to be men. A few had the courage to candidly share that they felt alienated and excluded when it came to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I). They expressed their support for creating a more diverse and equitable culture but explained that they either didn't know how or felt fearful about saying or doing the wrong thing. They also shared that they felt a tone of blame for the gaps in the organization, which created a mindset of defensiveness versus a sense of being a welcome part of the problem-solving process.Story continuesTheir open tone, the trust they extended, and their vulnerability were humbling and inspiring. That moment crystallized for me the importance of inviting all people, not only underrepresented individuals, to the conversation about DE&amp;I. We need to be intentional about listening, seeking to understand and assuming positive intent. And we need to offer learning opportunities and a safe space for those embarking on their own DE&amp;I journeys to express their fears, challenges and questions.Key learning: Diversity, equity and inclusion is not a zero-sum game. Including all groups, and all demographics - including the majority - is at the core of building a culture that can drive meaningful DE&amp;I progress.Moment #3: Small acts make a big differenceI work with a communications manager named Dina who helps us put together our Urology town halls, events which are attended by more than 1,000 of our Urology employees around the globe. I happened to be in Dubai last year, during one of our recent town halls, and Dina - who is of Egyptian origin - suggested we have our opening song be a popular Arabic one. She thought it could be a nice way to honor our location and recognize our global team. Right away I thought, ""what a fun idea,"" but I didn't think of it as a grand gesture of inclusion.Soon after the meeting, I received an email from one of our U.S. employees of Arabic descent:""Meghan, I immediately recognized the Arabic song that was played today and thought to myself, ‘wow, this is so cool.'

The company announced late-breaking data for Navitor during presentations at the annual Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) meeting held in Washington, D.C. (Feb 25-28, 2023).Results from this study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery.More About the StudyFollowing the development of Abbott's next-generation TAVI system, the company launched the PORTICO NG (Next Generation) study. This prospective, multicenter, international, single-arm trial supports the FDA approval of the Navitor TAVI system that was received back in January 2023.PORTICO NG specifically demonstrates the safety of the Navitor TAVI system and its effectiveness in minimizing blood leakage around the valve implant.In this regard, we note that the Navitor TAVI system, the latest addition to the company's comprehensive transcatheter structural heart portfolio, offers less-invasive treatment options for some of the most common and serious heart diseases.Navitor’s unique fabric cuff (NaviSeal) is expected to reduce or eliminate the backflow of blood around the valve frame, known as the paravalvular leak. Additionally, the new device is the only self-expanding TAVI system with leaflets within the native valve. This design is expected to aid in improving access to coronary arteries to facilitate future procedures for treating coronary artery disease.The Amplatzer Amulet LAA UpdateAbbott also showcased late-breaking data for the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder at the annual CRT meeting. This study highlights the benefits of this device's immediate and complete closure of the LAA for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) at risk of stroke.According to the company, the Amulet IDE trial’s findings demonstrated that the Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder with dual-seal technology (consisting of a lobe or piece to fill the cavity of the LAA and a disc to seal off the opening into the LAA) had fewer unresolved, severe peri-device leaks (PDLs), where blood leaks around the implant, compared to Boston Scientific's BSX Watchman‡ device that has a single component to close the LAA.Story continuesPer Abbott, severe PDLs with Amulet were less commonly associated with adverse events and deaths than BSX’s Watchman.Competitive Niche in Transcatheter Aortic Valve SpacePer a report by Allied Market Research, the global TAVI market was valued at $4,559 million in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $16,937 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 14%. Factors like the increase in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, rise in demand for various TAVI procedures and rise in the elderly population are likely to drive the market.Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device sales grew 22% organically in the last-reported fourth quarter of 2022. Strong utilization in the United States was supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, the company completed the enrollment of the CHAMPION-AF trial ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond.Edwards Lifesciences EW, within TAVR in 2022, received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. The company continued to advance enrollment in the PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from the Alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce Edwards Lifesciences’ long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions.Medtronic MDT, at the same time, despite healthcare staffing challenges, is seeing great physician reception for the company’s Evolut FX system, which just completed its full quarter launch in the United States. Evolut FX combines industry-leading durability with enhanced and predictable valve deployment. In addition, data presented at PCR London Valves showed that Evolut FX’s Commissure alignment has improved significantly, which is important for coronary access and valve hemodynamics. Medtronic is currently working to seek Evolut FX’s approval in the Japanese and European markets.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ABT recently presented late-breaking data from the Landmark COAPT trial for MitraClip, demonstrating the long-term benefits of the device in patients fighting heart failure. The data were presented at the American College of Cardiology's 72nd Annual Scientific Session together with the World Congress of Cardiology organized in New Orleans between March 4-6, 2023.The recent development will fortify Abbott’s Structural Heart’s business.Study DetailsIn the COAPT trial, symptomatic heart failure patients with severe secondary MR —  a condition in which a leaky valve caused by problems affecting other areas of the heart allows blood to flow back through the mitral valve — were evaluated with MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy or guideline-directed medical therapy alone.The five-year results from the landmark COAPT trial demonstrated that MitraClip is safe, effective and can reduce hospitalizations while improving survival for heart failure patients with severe secondary (or functional) MR.Benefits of Favorable ResultsWith about two decades of clinical experience in transcatheter mitral repair, Abbott's MitraClip paved the way for advancement in supporting people with mitral regurgitation, offering an alternative to surgery for patients who often need treatment to survive.These five-year COAPT results prove that MitraClip is safe and effective at treating secondary MR in advanced heart failure patients, minimizing hospitalizations and helping patients live longer.Per Abbott’s management, these results indicate that MitraClip plays a vital role in enhancing the symptoms of people with this serious heart condition and getting them back to living their fullest lives.Industry ProspectsPer a recent Allied Market Research market, the global structural heart devices market is expected to be worth $12.1 million by 2022, at a CAGR of 10.5%. Given the rising rate of cardiac ailments and the critical need to detect them, we believe Abbott is well-positioned to cash in on the opportunities in this market.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsThis month, Abbott presented late-breaking data for the TriClip transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) system –a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device developed specifically for tricuspid heart valve repair. The TRILUMINATE Pivotal study assesses the superiority of TriClip compared to medical therapy in treating patients with severe, symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) at intermediate or greater risk for open-heart surgery.Last month, Abbott presented late-breaking data for its newest-generation Navitor transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system. The study supported Navitor's recent FDA approval to treat people with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at high or greater risk for open-heart surgery. The company also demonstrated late-breaking data for the Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occluder that continue to reflect the benefits of this device's immediate and complete closure of the LAA – a differentiator from competing therapies – for patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib) at risk of stroke.Developments Within PeersA few other companies like Medtronic plc MDT, Edwards Lifesciences, Inc. EW and Boston Scientific, Inc. BSX are also progressing well within the Heart segment.In February 2023, Medtronic announced the relaunch of its Harmony Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV) System – a minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease patients with native or surgically repaired right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Harmony TPV was designed to treat patients with RVOT anomalies who develop severe pulmonary valve regurgitation, a condition where blood leaks back into the right lower chamber of the heart after being pumped into the lungs.In November 2022, Edwards Lifesciences presented one-year results on patients treated in the single-arm, prospective, global, multi-center TRISCEND study of the company’s EVOQUE transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement system which demonstrated favorable safety, efficacy and quality-of-life outcomes.  The one-year outcomes demonstrated high survival and high freedom from heart failure hospitalization.In November 2022, Boston Scientific presented the first results from the ACURATE neo2 Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study evaluating the performance of the ACURATE neo2 Aortic Valve System. These trial data confirmed the success of meaningful and differentiated enhancements included in the design of the ACURATE neo2 valve, from low rates of PVL and first-time pacemaker implantation to excellent hemodynamic performance and high rates of procedural success and safety.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Boston Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Eric Francis Thepaut, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$848k worth of shares at a price of US$40.99 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$47.74. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 22% of Eric Francis Thepaut's stake.Insiders in Boston Scientific didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Boston Scientific better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Boston Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Boston Scientific shares. In total, insider Arthur C. Butcher sold US$583k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Boston ScientificAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Boston Scientific insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$165m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Boston Scientific Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Boston Scientific stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Be aware that Boston Scientific is showing 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Any deleverage in SG&amp;A costs might have been added deterrents.On Jan 9, 2023, Zumiez reported soft results for the holiday period.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3,371 million, indicating an improvement of 10.6% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this operator of convenience stores is expected to have declined year over year.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 12.2%.Key Factors to NoteCasey's price and product optimization strategies, the increased penetration of private brands and digital engagements comprising mobile app and online ordering capabilities are commendable. The curbside pickup option and Casey’s reward program have been benefiting the overall performance.Moreover, Casey's has partnered with DoorDash and Uber Eats for delivery services. Also, the company’s self-distribution model and acquisition activities bode well. These factors are likely to have favorably impacted the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s top line.In its recent business update — announced on Jan 31 — the company highlighted that same-store inside sales for the quarter under discussion were in the lower half of the annual range of a 5-7% increase.

Casey's witnessed an increase of 7.7% in operating expenses in the last reported quarter. The metric increased due to operating more stores compared with the same period last year and a rise in same-store credit card fees. For the quarter under review, management anticipated total operating expense growth to be near the low end of the annual range of a 9-10% increase.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Casey's this time.

The VX-264 program does not require the use of immunosuppression, which may broaden the population of people with T1D that this investigational therapy could reach.Vertex plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the first half of 2023 to study the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264 in patients with T1D. The company previously received approval from Health Canada on the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for VX-264, and the Phase 1/2 trial is ongoing in Canada.""VX-264 uses the same stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cells as our VX-880 program where we’ve already demonstrated proof-of-concept, with the addition of a proprietary immunoprotective device that allows us to eliminate the need for immunosuppression,"" said Bastiano Sanna, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief of Cell and Genetic Therapies at Vertex. ""We are excited to see our second program in T1D advancing into the clinic and look forward to bringing transformative, if not curative, therapies to T1D patients who are waiting.""Vertex is pursuing multiple investigational approaches using stem cell-derived islets with the aim of replacing the insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D. Vertex’s first clinical investigational program in T1D, VX-880, is a stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy used in combination with immunosuppression. Vertex has demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept in the VX-880 program, and the Phase 1/2 clinical study is ongoing in the U.S. and Canada.Story continuesAbout VX-264VX-264 is an investigational cell therapy in which allogeneic human stem cell-derived islets are encapsulated in a channel array device designed to shield the cells from the body’s immune system. VX-264 is designed to be surgically implanted and is currently being evaluated for patients with T1D.About the VX-264 Phase 1/2 Clinical TrialThe clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, single-arm, open-label study in patients who have T1D. This will be a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264. Approximately 17 patients will be enrolled in the global clinical trial.About Type 1 DiabetesT1D results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas, leading to loss of insulin production and impairment of blood glucose control. The absence of insulin leads to abnormalities in how the body processes nutrients, leading to high blood glucose levels. High blood glucose can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and, over time, to complications such as kidney disease/failure, eye disease (including vision loss), heart disease, stroke, nerve damage and even death.Due to the limitations and complexities of insulin delivery systems, it can be difficult to achieve and maintain balance in glucose control in people with T1D. Current standards of care do not address the underlying causes of the disease, and there are limited treatment options beyond insulin for the management of T1D; there is currently no cure for diabetes.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF. Beyond CF, Vertex has a robust clinical pipeline of investigational small molecule, cell and genetic therapies in other serious diseases where it has deep insight into causal human biology, including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain, type 1 diabetes and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.Founded in 1989 in Cambridge, Mass., Vertex's global headquarters is now located in Boston's Innovation District and its international headquarters is in London. Additionally, the company has research and development sites and commercial offices in North America, Europe, Australia and Latin America. Vertex is consistently recognized as one of the industry's top places to work, including 13 consecutive years on Science magazine's Top Employers list and one of Fortune’s Best Workplaces in Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals and Best Workplaces for Women.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals share price has climbed 67% in five years, easily topping the market return of 40% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 22%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Vertex Pharmaceuticals managed to grow its earnings per share at 65% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Vertex Pharmaceuticals has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Vertex Pharmaceuticals' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 14.59, while its industry has an average P/E of 23.25. Over the past year, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.19 and as low as 13.22, with a median of 15.51.Investors will also notice that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1.30. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TXT's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.07. TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.55 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.17, all within the past year.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.16. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.67.Story continuesThese are only a few of the key metrics included in Textron's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the aforementioned contract.Details of the DealValued at $70.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide integrated logistics support in preparing Kuwait pilots for delivery of the Kuwait F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.The aforementioned integrated logistics support includes general logistics support; logistics program management; logistics support to aircraft during pilot training within the continental U.S. (CONUS); and maintenance of aircraft, aircraft armament equipment, F414 engines, and Sniper pods. It also includes logistics representative support within and outside the CONUS ferry support; packaging, handling, storage and transportation; and program security tasks.The deal will serve the government of Kuwait, with majority of the work projected to be executed in New Orleans, LA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during the 2022-2028 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT .Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales implies a 4.6% improvement from the 2022 reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.9%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.86%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2023 sales implies a 8.1% improvement from the 2022 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have gained 27.2% in the past 12 months against the industry’s 12.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shaw will deliver testimony Thursday before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Shaw will provide details on Norfolk Southern's commitment to making it right in East Palestine and the region, progress on environmental remediation, and the company's focus on safety. Below is his full testimony as provided to the committee.Norfolk Southern Corporation Logo (PRNewsfoto/Norfolk Southern Corporation)Testimony of Alan ShawPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Norfolk Southern CorporationChairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito, and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear today to discuss the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. My name is Alan Shaw, and I have been the President and CEO of Norfolk Southern since May 2022. I look forward today to sharing our progress cleaning the derailment site, assisting families whose lives were disrupted, investing in the community, and making Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry safer. I am deeply sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the people of East Palestine and surrounding communities, and I am determined to make it right.We will clean the site safely, thoroughly, and with urgency. We are making progress every day. Working now under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recent Unilateral Administrative Order, we have submitted a long-term removal plan that will guide our comprehensive testing program for the community's water, air, and soil. That testing is guided by science, and we will continue to share the results transparently. The Ohio and U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies, as well as other local agencies, are continually monitoring the air and water quality in East Palestine and report that both the air and water are safe.Financial assistance cannot change what happened, but it is an important part of doing the right thing. To date, we have committed to reimbursements and investments of more than $20 million in total, including by helping more than 4,200 families through our Family Assistance Center located in East Palestine. Supporting first responders has been a particular area of focus, and our contributions include more than $3 million to assist the East Palestine Fire Department. I would like to express again my profound admiration for the first responders from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia who responded to the derailment.Story continuesI want to be clear: this financial assistance is just a down payment. I've met with community leaders, business owners, school officials, clergy, and others to begin to identify ways we can invest in the future prosperity of East Palestine and support the long-term needs of its people. We will continue to invest in East Palestine for as long as it takes to help the community recover and thrive.We are also committed to learning from this accident and working with public officials and the industry to make railroads even safer. In the meantime, we have already launched a series of immediate steps to enhance safety, based on the facts in the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report. We look forward to cooperating with the NTSB as it continues its investigation into the root cause of the accident as well as its wider investigation.I. Our Commitment to Remediation and MonitoringI have visited the East Palestine area frequently since the accident. I've met with residents of the community. I've heard their concerns, and I understand why they are worried. Their feedback has informed our approach. Norfolk Southern is working around the clock to remediate the remaining issues and monitor for any impact on public health and the environment. We continue to work in close coordination with federal, state, and local governments and others to conduct environmental monitoring and to develop and carry out near- and longer-term clean-up activities. The remediation plan and each step of our longer-term efforts will be implemented at the direction of the U.S. EPA pursuant to the Agency's Unilateral Administrative Order.Norfolk Southern specialists remain on-scene, assisted by multiple derailment and environmental contractors. These teams have contained, diverted, and treated affected portions of nearby waterways, have flushed nearly a mile of surface waterways, and are capturing rainwater within the contaminated areas for temporary storage and disposal. To date, we have recovered and transported more than 3.5 million gallons of potentially affected water from the site for disposal at EPA-approved facilities.We also are working to safely remove affected soil, and our crews have removed more than 2,300 tons from the site. We have removed waste to landfills specifically engineered and permitted to safely handle this type of material. Our work will continue until the job is done.To date, monitoring of East Palestine's public drinking water and private water wells by multiple state and local authorities and Norfolk Southern shows that the water is safe to drink and there are no harmful levels of substances related to the derailment. Beginning immediately after the derailment and now at the direction of the U.S. EPA, we have implemented a comprehensive testing program to monitor the quality of the community's air. The U.S. EPA has monitored air near schools and residential areas, in several government buildings, upwind of the derailment site, and downwind of the derailment area. Norfolk Southern's outdoor air monitoring program has collected millions of data points from around the derailment site and throughout the community. The results of these tests continue to demonstrate that the air is safe to breathe. In addition, in consultation with the U.S. EPA, we have been performing indoor air quality screening for residents. To date, nearly 600 homes have been screened; none of the results indicate a health risk from incident-related substances.We continue to listen to the experts and cooperate with state, federal, and local government agencies. We are committed to this monitoring for as long as necessary. We have also created a website, NSMakingItRight.com, to provide the latest information to residents of East Palestine and the surrounding communities.II. Our Commitment to the CommunityI want the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities to know that Norfolk Southern and I are deeply committed to them and their recovery. To date, we have invested more than $13 million as a down payment and provided support to more than 4,200 families through our Family Assistance Center in East Palestine, including:More than $3 million in reimbursements and support to the East Palestine Fire Department for fire equipment used in the derailment response;A $1 million fund available immediately to community leaders to identify where donations can do the most good;Another $1 million fund to support the immediate needs of the community, overseen by a Norfolk Southern craft railroader who lives in East Palestine and has been hired to serve as a community liaison, reporting directly to my office;$300,000 to the East Palestine City School District to support the district's academics, athletics, extracurricular activities, and long-term contingency planning regarding the impacts of the derailment;Funding and coordination of cleaning and air monitoring services for the East Palestine Elementary and High Schools; and$65,000 to the East Palestine Youth Sports Association to allow children to play in sports leagues for free for the year.We have committed another $7.5 million in financial assistance to reimburse Pennsylvania emergency responders and health and environmental agencies for costs related to the derailment. And I personally have committed almost $450,000 to fund scholarships for seniors at East Palestine High School.In addition to the nearly 200 Norfolk Southern employees and contractors who have been in East Palestine to help with remediation and financial assistance, we also have many employee volunteers who have come to the community to help. To offer just one example of how they are finding ways big and small to make a difference, our new community liaison recently observed that a local flower shop missed out on one of its biggest sales days of the year, Valentine's Day, due to the disruption caused by the derailment. He ordered 100 bouquets of flowers from the shop and, with the help of our volunteers, distributed them to residents at a local assisted living community. That is the Norfolk Southern culture in action, and I could not be prouder.Again, this is a down payment. I am going to see this through. There are no strings attached to our assistance—if residents have a concern, we want them to come talk to us. I understand how much East Palestine means to each resident, and we are committed to making this right.III. Our Focus on SafetyWe are committed to making the rail industry safer. We will analyze and address the NTSB's investigation results when they are available, but we are not waiting to act.The NTSB's preliminary report released last month reflected that the Norfolk Southern crew was operating the train within our protocols and below the speed limit. The sensors in place to identify overheated axles operated properly, and the crew took the appropriate action when they received the alert. We currently spend $1 billion a year on technologies, equipment, and infrastructure to enhance safety. But the safety mechanisms in place did not prevent this accident, so we are focused on learning from this incident and working with industry to make changes.The morning after the derailment, I spoke to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy and pledged the full cooperation of Norfolk Southern in the NTSB's investigation. Chair Homendy has said publicly that the derailment occurred at the twenty-third car, a hopper car, with a particular focus on a catastrophic failure of the wheel bearing on this car. This car carried plastic pellets, and it was the combination of those pellets and a hot axle that appear to have started the fire. Neither Norfolk Southern nor the other Class I railroads own plastic-pellet hopper cars. That's one reason why an industry-wide comprehensive approach, including railcar owners, car manufacturers, leasing companies, equipment makers, and the railroad companies, is essential to help improve safety as the rail industry continues to provide the logistical infrastructure that enables the United States' economy to grow. It's going to take all of us—and we're eager to lead that effort.As an initial step—and focusing on what we can do on our own—we are making our network of early-warning sensors stronger. Shortly after the derailment, I instructed my team to immediately look at steps we can take to improve safety further, and we are taking the following actions:Enhancing the hot bearing detector network;Piloting next-generation hot bearing detectors;Deploying more acoustic bearing detectors;Accelerating our Digital Train Inspection program; andAnalyzing—with others in the industry—available data for patterns that could provide earlier warnings of potential safety issues, and partnering with other railroads to review best practices, including how the industry should respond to high-temperature alarms.An essential part of our effort to make Norfolk Southern an even safer company is to further strengthen our safety culture. To describe how we are doing that, I would like to provide some important context on the new strategy we announced for Norfolk Southern at the end of last year. In a significant departure from the railroad industry's recent past, we deliberately moved away from a singular focus on operating ratio, which is a common industry measure of efficiency. Instead, we are taking a more balanced approach to service, productivity, and growth.As just one example of what our strategy means in practice, instead of furloughing workers during periodic economic downturns, we intend to use the opportunity to invest in our workforce and provide additional training. When we do that, it makes us a more resilient company that is better able to serve our customers, and it creates more career opportunities for our craft railroaders. We hired craft railroaders aggressively throughout 2022 and continue to do so this year.Our new strategy goes hand-in-hand with our intensified focus on culture and employee engagement, with an emphasis on transparency and collaboration. I know that when Norfolk Southern is successful, it is because our craft colleagues are getting the job done for our customers and the U.S. economy. I have spent countless hours in the field in the 10 months I have served as CEO, thanking our front-line railroaders for their service and listening to their ideas on how to make Norfolk Southern better.When we completed the recent round of national labor negotiations, with a historic and well-deserved 24 percent pay increase, I committed immediately to begin negotiations at the local level on quality-of-life issues like paid sick leave. We did what we said we were going to do and have already reached agreements on paid sick leave with three of our unions.IV. Our Commitment to Industry ActionWe are working with others in the industry in moving forward. All seven Class 1 railroads recently announced that we will join the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS). Norfolk Southern was already actively participating in the C3RS Working Group that is part of the Department of Transportation's Railroad Safety Advisory Committee. With all Class 1 carriers joining the FRA's program, Norfolk Southern is building upon its own long-standing Close Call Experience Program.And we believe it is important that we leverage Norfolk Southern's data, as well as data from industry partners, to reevaluate alarm threshold temperatures for bearing heat sensors. Norfolk Southern's wayside detectors trigger an alarm at a temperature threshold that is among the lowest in the rail industry. Our wayside heat detectors are regularly inspected every 30 days and are spaced more closely than many others in the industry. We are also exploring new technologies and refinements to current systems.V. ConclusionFinally, Chairman Carper, Senator Capito and members of the Committee, I want to state again how deeply sorry we are for the impact of this derailment on East Palestine, surrounding communities and all of the people who have been affected. We are making progress in the recovery and know our work is not yet done. On behalf of the more than 19,700 hard-working employees of Norfolk Southern, I pledge that we won't be finished until we make it right. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today, and I look forward to your questions.About Norfolk SouthernSince 1827, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) and its predecessor companies have safely moved the goods and materials that drive the U.S. economy.

But he stopped short of fully endorsing tougher safety regulations or specific commitments to pay for long-term health and economic harm.In a packed Senate hearing, CEO Alan Shaw said his railroad firmly supports the goal of improving rail safety, but he also defended his company's record.He was questioned closely by both Democrats and Republicans about specific commitments to pay for long-term health and economic harm — and about the decision making that led to the release and burn of toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars — as well as the company's commitment to safety and helping the people of East Palestine, Ohio.“I’m terribly sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the folks of that community,” Shaw told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. “We’re going to be there for as long as it takes to help East Palestine thrive and recover.”But the condolences and commitment of $20 million in aid so far hardly satisfied lawmakers or several East Palestine residents who traveled to Washington for the hearing.“How do we trust that man with our health and the health of our children, when he won’t even answer the questions that we need answered,” said Jami Cozza, adding that her family continues to suffer from illnesses over a month after the derailment.The company has announced several voluntary safety upgrades. Senators, however, are looking to act themselves as they investigate the derailment, the Biden administration's response and the company's safety practices after the toppling of 38 railcars, including 11 carrying hazardous materials.Norfolk Southern is also under pressure from federal regulators. The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Railroad Administration both announced investigations this week of the East Palestine derailment and other accidents, including the death of a train conductor Tuesday.Story continuesJust Thursday, a Norfolk Southern train derailed in Alabama. Company and local officials said there was no threat to the public.In the East Palestine crash, no one was injured but half of the roughly 5,000 local residents were evacuated. Scenes of billowing smoke above the town, alongside complaints from residents that they are still suffering from illnesses, have turned national attention to railroad safety and the ways dangerous materials are transported.It's all sparked a show of bipartisanship in the Senate. The committee on Thursday also heard from Ohio and Pennsylvania senators — Republican JD Vance and Democrats Sherrod Brown and Bob Casey — who are proposing new safety regulations under a Railway Safety Act of 2023.Train derailments have been getting less common, but there were still more than 1,000 last year, according to data the Federal Railroad Administration. And as East Palestine shows, even a single train derailment involving hazardous materials can be disastrous.Hazardous materials shipments account for 7% to 8% of the roughly 30 million shipments railroads deliver across the U.S. each year. But railroads often mix shipments and might have one or two cars of hazardous materials on almost any train. The Association of American Railroads trade group says 99.9% of hazardous materials shipments reach their destinations safely.The Senate Commerce Committee will also hear from Norfolk Southern’s Shaw, as well as NTSB chair ​​Jennifer Homendy, in another hearing later this month. That committee is also expected to consider the proposed safety regulations.Shaw is backing proposals to tighten standards for tank cars that the railroads don’t own, expand hazardous materials training for first responders and establish standards for the trackside detectors railroads use to spot problems. The company has also said it is adding “approximately 200 hot bearing detectors” to its network. The NTSB has said a detector warned the crew operating the train that derailed Feb. 3 outside East Palestine, but they couldn’t stop the train before more than three dozen cars came off the tracks and caught fire.Some lawmakers want to push beyond voluntary safety upgrades. The Railway Safety Act of 2023, which has gained support from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would require more hot bearing detectors to be installed, set limits on train length and make sure railroads notify states about the hazardous materials they are transporting.Some Republicans have hesitated to support the proposal, resisting efforts to impose new regulations.Vance, an Ohio senator who first won election last November, slammed those in his party who have dismissed his bill, saying they are ignoring a shift in the GOP to appeal to blue-collar voters.“We have a choice: Are we for big business and big government, or are we for the people of East Palestine?” he said.Republicans, at the same time, are more eager to delve into the emergency response to the East Palestine derailment.Thursday’s hearing also featured environmental protection officials from the federal, state and local levels. They acknowledged communication problems in the days immediately after the derailment including around the decision to release and burn the vinyl chloride.Republicans have criticized President Joe Biden for not visiting the community in the aftermath of the derailment. The Democratic president has said he will visit at some point, and the White House notes that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg went to East Palestine and has pressed for increased safety protocols for trains.The Senate bill also touches on a disagreement between railroad worker unions and operators by requiring train crews to continue to have two people. Unions argue that railroads are riskier because of job cuts in the industry over the past six years. Nearly one-third of all rail jobs were eliminated and train crews, they say, deal with fatigue because they are on call night and day.Shaw said Norfolk Southern has gone on a “hiring spree” in the past year, but he didn't back a requirement to maintain two-person crews on freight railroads.He pointed to over $1 billion the company spent on safety last year, but he acknowledged that Norfolk Southern also spent more than $3 billion buying back its own stock and recorded a $3.3 billion profit in 2022.""I am committed to making Norfolk Southern’s safety culture the best in the industry,” he told the Senate panel.Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts rejected Shaw’s talk of safety after a recent string of incidents including another derailment last Saturday near Springfield, Ohio, and the death of a conductor this week at a steel plant in Cleveland.""It seems like every week there’s another accident that Norfolk Southern is a part of in our country. So you might think that you’ve put in enough but the facts are saying just the opposite,” Markey said.The senator also pressed Shaw to make specific commitments including paying for the loss of home values in East Palestine. Shaw repeated this refrain: “I am committed to do what's right.”Markey retorted, “What’s right for the community will then be balanced — which is what we can see from the stock buybacks — with what’s right from Norfolk Southern, and that’s going to be to sue, to fight, to resist full compensation for these communities.”Misti Allison, an East Palestine resident, said she also was frustrated by the lack of specifics from Shaw. She prepared to fly back to her home where a chemical odor still lingers as authorities remove contaminated soil.“It’s heartbreaking because people have real valid concerns right now. People are sick,"" Allison said. ""That contaminated soil that they were talking about — it's still there. They’re driving it down our roads.”]"

There are no strings attached to our assistance,"" Shaw's testimony says.Norfolk Southern has been under fire after a number of derailments of its trains, particularly one it operated in East Palestine, Ohio, that caused cars carrying toxic vinyl chloride and other hazardous chemicals to spill and catch fire.The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) both announced new safety probes of the railroad Tuesday after the death of a conductor in Cleveland, Ohio, when a train was struck by a dump truck.The NTSB said given the number and significance of recent Norfolk Southern accidents it was opening a special investigation and ""urges the company to take immediate action today to review and assess its safety practices.""Following the East Palestine derailment, some of the town's 4,700 residents have reported ailments such as rashes and breathing difficulties and fear long-term health effects. No deaths or injuries were reported after the accident.Debra Shore, a regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, will tell lawmakers at the hearing that about 600 homes had been screened for air quality and vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride detected.Story continues""Every time a train whistle blows, they are reminded of the trauma visited upon them by Norfolk Southern,"" she said in her written testimony for Thursday's hearing.Shaw pledged to ""clean the site safely, thoroughly, and with urgency.""Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Anne Vogel will tell the committee that her agency ""will not stop until the science definitively shows that the residents of East Palestine are safe in their beautiful community.""

And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Sue Perram, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Perram. Please go ahead.Susanne J. PerramThank you, and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank each of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's Third Quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Lawson Whiting, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Leanne Cunningham, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter and 9 months ended January 31, 2023, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Leanne will walk through momentarily.Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events and Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lawson.Story continuesLawson E. WhitingThank you, Sue, and hello, everyone. I'm proud of the results that we're sharing with you today as we delivered strong organic performance for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023. Before I go into the details of our most recent results, I wanted to take a moment to step back and acknowledge that it has now been 3 full years since March of 2020, which for Brown-Forman and the world was the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since that time, we've experienced significant volatility and uncertainty while always remaining focused on the long-term health and growth of our portfolio of brands and our people. Consider that during this 3-year time period, we added 2 new super premium brands in Gin Mare and Diplomático and we divested others. We just launched a major global initiative with Jack &amp; Coke. We grew by more than 500 employees as we evolved our route-to-consumers in 5 markets, strengthened our integrated marketing communications capabilities and grew our emerging brands teams, among other changes. And importantly, compared to the first 9 months of fiscal '20, we grew Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey by 1.5 million cases in which we reserved by 500,000 cases even amid severe supply chain constraints. Through it all, we delivered what our investors have come to expect from Brown-Forman, consistent, reliable compounding of growth. If you follow Brown-Forman long enough, you know that we often speak not in quarters or years or even decades, we speak in generations. And I truly believe one of our greatest competitive advantages is this long-term perspective. It allows us to demonstrate creativity and resilience in the face of constant change to execute on our strategic priorities and invest boldly behind our brands and our people. This focus has allowed us to deliver short-term results that are in line and recently even ahead of our historical growth rates while still investing in our business. And it is this long-term focus that gives me confidence that as the world and our business begin to normalize, we will continue to deliver against our long-term growth algorithm, producing mid-single-digit organic top line growth and high single-digit organic operating income growth over the next decade. So regardless of how you look at our business through the lens of the last 3 months, the last 3 quarters, the last 3 years or the last 3 decades, I believe you will reach the same conclusion. Brown-Forman's business is strong. We are well positioned in the best categories and price points, and there's nothing better in the market than our talented people around the world. Now turning the focus back to our year-to-date fiscal '23 net sales results. We delivered high single-digit top line growth on a reported basis and double-digit top line growth on an organic basis as the reported results were impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Organic net sales growth in the first 9 months was driven by continued strong growth for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in our international markets in the Travel Retail channel by Woodford Reserve in the U.S. and a strong performance in RTDs driven by Jack Daniel's RTDs in Australia and Germany, along with New Mix in Mexico. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey continued to be the largest driver of our top line performance here to date, delivering 12% organic net sales growth, driven by strong consumer demand, higher pricing and the rebuilding of distributor inventories. Given the size of this brand and the fact that the brand delivered a 20% organic net sales increase in the year-ago period, this growth is particularly impressive. Consumer demand for Woodford Reserve also remained very strong, and we're significantly better positioned to meet this demand to supply constraints mainly related to glass have eased, and we increased our bottling capacity. This resulted in organic net sales growing 35% through the first 9 months of the year. There's been some exciting news in the past couple of months for Woodford Reserve, which I believe will continue to position the brand for future success. In January, we announced that Woodford Reserve entered into an agreement with Churchill Downs to renew Woodford as the presenting sponsor of the Kentucky Derby through 2027. The extended partnership also includes Old Forester as the official mint julep for the Kentucky Derby, along with Finlandia and Herradura. Woodford Reserve also recently named Elizabeth McCall as Master Distiller, the third in the brand's 26-year history and the first female Master Distiller. She is the second generation of her family to work in the spirits industry following in our mother's footsteps. Elizabeth builds on the legacy crafted by Chris Morris, who is taking on a Master Distiller, Emeritus role and has been instrumental in the growth of Woodford over the past 25 years. We're very thankful for Chris and Elizabeth and all they are doing to build a very promising future for Woodford Reserve. RTDs remain the third largest contributor to overall company growth, driven by the consumer trends of convenience and flavor. Jack Daniel's RTDs grew organic net sales 10% and New Mix delivered 41% organic net sales growth. While on the topic of RTDs, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at one of the oldest and one of the newest brands in our RTD portfolio. First, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails which we launched in the early 1990s. 2 years ago on this call, we announced that we are partnering with Pabst Brewing Company for the supply, sales and distribution of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails within the United States. We believe that the partnership would provide tremendous growth potential for the brand with greater access to production and variety pack capabilities, along with Pabst distribution network which would provide more efficient access to new distribution channels. I'm pleased to say that our beliefs were correct. Based on Nielsen at the beginning of February, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails was the second fastest-growing flavored malt beverage in the United States, continuing to gain share and grow distribution. Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails is now a top 10 flavored malt beverage brand, and I want to thank both the Brown-Forman and Pabst teams for significantly accelerating the growth of this brand. I also have immense gratitude for the teams at Brown-Forman and the Coca-Cola Company, who are working on our newest RTD, and that is, of course, Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola. While we only have a couple of months of data from the distributors since the November launch in Cancun, Mexico, the early results are certainly very positive. They shared that the 9-liter case volume of the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD significantly exceeded the volume of the Jack Dan's and cola RTD in the equivalent 2-month period a year ago. They reached the distribution target within days of launch, showing the excitement and enthusiasm from the retailers and the consumer repurchase rate is encouraging. The experiences and learnings from Cancun has helped to set the stage for a successful national launch across Mexico, which began in early February. These learnings will also be shared with other markets that are launching soon, including the United States, a number of European markets as well as Japan. For these initial markets, cans are now rolling off the production lines and will be on retailer shelves in cold boxes in late March and early April. We're excited not only about the potential growth of this product, but also believe as we always have with RTDs that the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD will have a positive impact on the [full strength] family of brands. RTDs serve as consumer recruitment vehicle, bringing new consumers of legal drinking age into the Jack Daniel's family as well as a marketing vehicle visibly showcasing the trademark and what we often call cans and hands. The Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD launches will be supported by a new global advertising campaign, jointly funded by Brown-Forman and the Coca-Cola Company, which introduces the product and showcases the incredible attitude of these 2 iconic trademarks coming together in a single can. We'll continue the product launch in additional European, Asian, African and Latin American markets throughout the calendar year 2023, and I look forward to sharing more in the upcoming quarters. While we're on the topic of product launches, I want to briefly provide an update on Jack Daniel's Bonded. Over the past 5 years, we've been working purposely to premiumize the Jack Daniel's family brands and elevate our whiskey credentials initially laying the foundation with specialty launches such as Jack Daniel's Single Barrel special release heritage barrel and Jack Daniel's 10-year-old Tennessee Whiskey. Earlier this fiscal year, we introduced the first Jack Daniel's super-premium permanent line extensions in over 25 years with Jack Daniel's Bonded Tennessee whiskey and Jack Daniel's Triple mash whiskey. In just a few months, the new Bonded series received powerful and impactful claim from whiskey critics across the globe, including Jack Daniel's Bonded being named the 2022 Whiskey of the Year by Whiskey Advocate, the most coveted global accolade in the whiskey industry. Like the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTDs, these new whiskeys give both long-term friends of Jack Daniel's and new friends, the opportunity to explore and discover within the Jack Daniel's family. While there is excitement and momentum in the whiskey and RTD categories, tequila remains an attractive and fast-growing category within total distilled spirits. As we shared last quarter, after experiencing significant supply chain disruption to the first 3 months of fiscal '23, glass supply for Herradura has continued to increase. We're now better positioned to meet consumer demand and Herradura delivered a 9% increase in organic net sales in the first 9 months of fiscal '23. We're also seeing takeaway growth accelerate in the U.S. as distributor inventories are being rebuilt. And organic net sales for el Jimador increased 19%, driven by consumer demand and pricing growth, both in the U.S. and in Mexico. In November, we launched Herradura Legend, a unique Añejo tequila that has matured and heavily charred, new American White Oak barrels, a process that's unique in the category and one that leverages our barrel knowledge and expertise. As premiumization continues in the category, Legend is a permanent member of the Herradura portfolio that enables us to participate in the prestige price point segment. On the topic of pricing, 2 years ago, we introduced our long-term pricing strategy for our portfolio of brands, which aims to increase prices consistently year after year and to grow net sales through a combination of both volume and value. Our organic net sales growth benefited from 3 points of favorable price mix in the first 9 months of fiscal '23. This was driven by higher prices across much of our portfolio and was led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Based on the latest Nielsen data Brown-Forman's pricing growth of nearly 3% is outpacing total distilled spirits of just over 2%. Our revenue growth management initiatives, which includes identifying pricing opportunities, not just in the U.S., but in every market, are a key part of our comprehensive focus on top line growth. In summary, despite the volatility and uncertainty, disruptions and challenges, Brown-Forman continues to deliver against our long-term ambitions. Our long-term focus has allowed us to execute on our strategic priorities and invest in the momentum of our brands. This has produced strong organic results in the first 9 months of the fiscal year as well as over the last 3 years. So in closing, on this International Women's Day, I would like to acknowledge the women of Brown-Forman and thank them along with all of our very talented Brown-Forman employees around the globe for their commitment to our strategic priorities and our company values and their continued focus on delivering sustainable and consistent long-term growth day after day, year after year, generation after generation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leanne and she'll provide more details on our year-to-date results as well as our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '23.Leanne D. CunninghamThank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson reviewed the top line drivers from a portfolio perspective, for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023, I will provide a few additional details on the top line results as well as other items that drove our business results and our outlook for the fiscal year. First, as Lawson mentioned, for the 9 months of fiscal 2023, organic net sales increased 12% compared to the same period last year. The growth was driven by a 9% increase in volumes, particularly for New Mix, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's RTDs. We also gained 3% from price mix, reflecting higher prices across much of our portfolio, led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. From a geographic perspective, for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023, strong results were broad-based with organic net sales growth in each geographic cluster compared to the same period a year ago. Collectively, our emerging international markets continued to deliver very strong double-digit organic net sales growth, increasing 26%. This growth was led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, particularly in [Turkey] and Brazil, driven by improved product availability and supply chain disruption ease as well as increased pricing. RTDs also contributed to growth with New Mix and Jack Daniel's RTDs growing strong double digits in Mexico, where we are gaining share in a growing category and increasing price. In addition, Jack Daniel's RTDs were launched in Brazil earlier this year and are off to a very strong start. This impressive growth includes the impact of the year-over-year declines in Russia as we suspended our commercial operations almost exactly 1 year ago in March of 2022. Prior to this suspension, this market represented approximately 2% of our total reported net sales. Our developed international markets collectively delivered strong organic net sales growth, up 13% for the first 9 months. We continue to closely monitor the inflationary impact on consumer confidence and still have not observed signs of down trading. In fact, we have continued to increase price through our revenue growth management strategies as spirits remain an affordable luxury for consumers. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the largest contributor to growth in these markets, driven by Germany, where Jack is gaining share within the whiskey category; Japan, which is benefiting from strong consumer demand with growth in both the on- and off-trade; Korea, as the consumer is continuing to shift to international whiskey brands. And Belgium, as you'll recall, Belgium transitioned to own distribution at the beginning of calendar 2022, we believe that own distribution transition can fuel share growth, strengthen our portfolio, unlock future potential and enable us to capture more of the value chain. We are seeing that growth in Belgium as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey recently became the #1 whiskey brand in Belgium during the holiday season, achieving record market share in the month of December. Australia and Germany continued to drive the growth of Jack Daniel's RTDs, leading to double-digit organic net sales growth, which represented the next largest contributor to growth. The RTD category is growing in these large important markets, and we are gaining share. Our emerging brands team in Europe continues to drive the growth of brands such as el Jimador, Woodford Reserve, Gentleman Jack and GlenDronach. Each brand delivered double-digit organic net sales growth, reflecting our strategic priority of increasing focus on our premium and super-premium portfolio. Of course, Diplomático and Gin Mare are just getting started. We believe they will soon be a meaningful contributor to this emerging brands business. The U.S. business is beginning to normalize and delivered 4% organic net sales growth. As we have shared with you in the previous 3 quarters, the seasonality of our fiscal 2023 results have been impacted by the abnormal seasonality of the fiscal 2022 shipments due to supply chain disruptions. In the first half of fiscal 2022, distributor inventories did not increase ahead of the holiday season as is typical, and we experienced stronger shipments in the second half of fiscal 2022 as supply chain challenges began to ease. As expected in the first half of 2023, distributor inventories continued to return to more normalized levels, which benefited the U.S. net sales growth rate by 7 points, as we are now beginning to lap the increase in shipments related to the rebuilding of our inventory position in the prior-year period, particularly for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, we estimate the net change in distributor inventories reduced the net sales growth rate by 1 point for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Woodford Reserve remained the largest contributor to organic net sales growth, driven by strong consumer demand and an increase in distributor inventories as glass supply and capacity constraints continue to ease. Organic net sales also benefited from higher prices across the portfolio, led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, though partially offset by lower volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey as the brand lapped a strong prior year comparison. As you will recall, at this time last year, we shared that due to supply chain constraints, particularly for glass, we prioritize Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. This prioritization was reflected in the year-ago results as we met the strong consumer demand for the brand, particularly in the on-premise and focused on rebuilding inventory levels across the supply chain. Korbel California Champagne is benefiting from higher pricing, though that benefit is being more than offset by lower volume. In the U.S., the gap between Nielsen takeaway and our actual results have narrowed considerably as we lap many of the factors that created the disconnect, such as the shift to the on-premise with its reopening along with the brand and market prioritization impacts from the supply-chain challenges. Overall takeaway trends improved during the quarter as the industry began to normalize with total distilled spirits value growth in the mid-single digits, as we lap the impact of the supply-chain constraints that previously suppressed our performance, particularly for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentleman Jack and the Jack Daniel's Tennessee flavors, our takeaway performance is accelerating, and Brown-Forman has closed the gap with total distilled spirits for the first time in 2 years. We continue to work to rebuild finished goods inventory levels across the 3-tiered system and believe that distributor inventory levels are starting to normalize. We are continuing to rebuild some brands and sizes but shipments and depletions are now largely in balance across our full-strength portfolio. And finally, the Travel Retail channel continued its strong rebound as travel continued to rebound with the return of international airline travel and the cruise industry. Organic net sales grew 52%, led by higher volumes across much of our portfolio and our business has nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. Now turning to gross profit. In the first 9 months of fiscal 2023, our reported gross profit increased 5% or 11% on an organic basis. For gross margin, headwinds more than offset our tailwinds, resulting in 170 basis points of contraction compared to the same period last year. Favorable price mix and the removal of the European Union and United Kingdom tariffs on American whiskey were more than offset by higher costs due to the impact of inflation on our input costs and supply-chain disruptions, largely related to global logistics constraints as well as the negative effect of foreign exchange. Moving on to our operating expenses. Compared to the same prior year 9-month period, organic advertising expenses grew at a significantly higher rate than our top line growth, largely due to the timing of our increased marketing investment for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Woodford Reserve, the launch of Jack Daniel's Bonded and Herradura in the United States. Organic SG&amp;A investment increased double digits, driven primarily by higher compensation-related expenses and the investment behind our people as we return to in-person events and activities in support of our collaborative culture and relationship-based industry. Our reported operating expenses were impacted by 2 items: a noncash impairment charge for the Finlandia brand name, largely due to macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates and increasing costs and certain post-closing costs and expenses in connection with the acquisition of Diplomático, largely driven by costs related to the termination of existing distribution contracts as we integrate the brands into our distribution partners. In total, reported operating income decreased 13% and organic operating income grew 9% in the first 9 months of fiscal 2023. These results, combined with a pension settlement charge resulted in a diluted EPS decrease of 16% to $1.20 per share. Lastly, to our fiscal 2023 outlook, our performance for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023 was strong with high single-digit reported and double-digit organic net sales growth, driven by strong consumer demand, higher pricing and the rebuilding of distributor inventories. And while there were a number of items in the third quarter that negatively impacted our reported operating income results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023, we delivered high single-digit organic operating income growth. As trends begin to normalize globally, we remain confident in the broad-based growth of our U.S. and international markets, along with the travel retail channel. While the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains volatile and uncertain, we believe our business will remain resilient, reflecting strong consumer demand, the strength of our portfolio of brands, the continued execution of our pricing strategy and the return of inventory to more normalized levels. For the full year, the effect of the estimated net change in distributor inventories could range from no impact to a moderate unfavorable impact on our results as we lap the significant inventory rebuilding during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Our guidance assumes no impact from an estimated net change in distributor inventories for the full year, and we now expect organic net sales growth in the range of 8% to 10%. As it relates to our fiscal 2023 cost, the inflationary environment increased input costs ahead of our expectations and supply chain disruptions, particularly transportation, logistics, and freight, while easing remain challenging. Additionally, we have noted the impact of foreign exchange on our reported results. While the U.S. dollar has weakened from its peak in September, the U.S. dollar remained strong against many major currencies, most notably against the euro, Turkish lira, Pound Sterling and Polish zloty. As we continue to navigate these challenges and work to limit their impact, we expect the headwinds of inflation, supply chain disruption costs and foreign exchange to impact our full year results. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we continue to expect pricing and the removal of the EU and U.K. tariffs on American whiskey to remain tailwinds for the full year. Based on these headwinds and tailwinds, we continue to expect full year reported gross margin to be consistent with the first half of fiscal 2023. We are reaffirming our expectations for operating expenses as we believe that investments in our brands and our people will drive strong long-term top and bottom line growth. As a reminder, since the time we were burdened with the EU and U.K. tariffs, we have long been committed to reinvesting a portion of the tariff relief back behind our brands once removed, which we were finally able to act upon in fiscal 2023, driving our brand investment at a rate above our top line growth, and we will also invest in our people to support our business needs in a more normalized environment. Based on the above expectations and assuming no full year impact from the estimated net change in distributor inventories, we continue to anticipate high single-digit organic operating income growth. We continue to expect our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 22% to 23%, and our capital expenditures are still planned to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. In summary, we are pleased and proud of the strong results delivered for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023, with double-digit organic net sales growth that was broad-based across our portfolio and geographies. And as expected, the seasonality of our fiscal 2023 results are being impacted by the abnormal seasonality of the fiscal 2022 shipments related to the supply chain disruptions. As trends are normalizing, we believe our business will remain resilient, reflecting the strength of our portfolio of brands and our talented people. We also believe our long-term perspective enables us to navigate the changes of our world and to deliver sustainable and consistent long-term performance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Vivien Azer of Cowen.Vivien Nicole AzerSo I wanted to follow up on the commentary around the Jack and Coke strong start internationally. Is it possible to quantify that at all in terms of the contribution to country-level growth and/or the impact that it had on the broader Jack franchise? And then as a follow-up to that, can we talk a little bit about the expected investment spending for the U.S. launch as well?Lawson E. WhitingYes, Vivien. A couple of things. One, as I think you know, the launch was really in Cancun over the last few months. It was not even across the entire country of Mexico. And so, the impact on this fiscal year is negligible, even probably within the country of Mexico would be negligible. So -- but look, I mean, I think in Leanne's -- on some of the comments that she made, it's off to a good start. We're pleased with the distribution. We're pleased with the consumer repurchase rates and everything. So everything is going sort of as planned or even maybe a little bit better than planned, but it's tough to extrapolate or see that impacting fiscal '23. Now fiscal '24, I mean, we haven't given any guidance yet on that, and we'll probably do that after -- in the next quarter when we start talking a lot more about fiscal '24. But I think it is worth pointing out a little bit about how this is going to work just so that you all understand how the model works. And I'll just use a couple of examples. We can use Mexico as probably a good starting point. The Coca-Cola Company has taken the lead and the business model is actually similar to how they work with their bottlers around the world. But instead of 2 players, there's 3 as we are part of that too. So the revenues, the costs, the brand expense, all of that will be reflected on the Coca-Cola Company's P&amp;L, not on Brown-Forman's, we will be selling whiskey -- bulk whiskey, almost the equivalent of concentrate in their terms. And so that's the revenue impact on us, but you're not going to see the full P&amp;L impact in a country like Mexico. Turning to the U.S. If you look at the U.S., and it's going to be also similar for Germany and Australia, which are our 2 really big RTD markets, we're going to handle the manufacturing and the distribution. And so U.S., Australia, Germany, you will see the revenues, the brand expense, the costs all in our P&amp;L. So it's difficult when you try to consolidate the 2 to figure out how is that all total up because it really is going to depend on the balance of sales between all the different markets around the world. But 1 way or the other, we still feel pretty good about it. And we'll talk more about that, as I say, in the next quarter.Leanne D. CunninghamAnd then from an investment perspective, to answer the second part of your question, this is about, as often mentioned, you jointly being funded between Brown-Forman and the Coca-Cola Company and that joint advertising will also have a halo effect over the entire Jack Daniel's family of brands kind of as we think amplifying the trademark.OperatorOur next question will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.Drew Nolan LevineThis is Drew Levine on for Andrea. So I wanted to ask on the gross margins. It doesn't seem like the cost headwinds really abated much at all. Although I think last quarter, there was a pretty sizable headwind due to mitigation efforts to get the product on shelf in addition to inflation, obviously. So could you talk about where you're seeing continued pressure on that cost line and how you see it evolving over the coming quarters? Because I would think most of those mitigation efforts were in the past, but maybe it doesn't appear. So any color there would be helpful.Leanne D. CunninghamOkay. And I'll take that in 2 parts. So where we are kind of year-to-date and then stepping back from our full year outlook. First, I think it's important that you'll recall our full year guidance, which is consistent in line with our first half of 2023. So it does imply improvement in the fourth quarter. For us, our normal seasonality of the fourth quarter generally has a positive impact on gross margin and we will have a benefit in lapping the foreign exchange impact that we had in the fourth quarter last year. Continue to say we're always fortunate with our premium and super premium portfolio of brands that can handle the pressure that we've been facing over these last quarters. So as you can see on Slide 7, we did contract 170 basis points, ending at 58.4%. That price mix positively impacted gross margin by 200 basis points due to price increases across our portfolio, led largely by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Then we have the removal, a positive impact of the removal of the European Union and U.K. tariffs on American whiskey, which benefited our gross margin by 170 basis points. Specifically to your point on costs, our cost for the year-to-date was negatively impacted 430 basis points, and it's those 2 key drivers, which is the impact of inflation, which we are still seeing largely on most of our commodities. So some of that is beginning to ease. I'll speak to that in a moment. And then energy and fuel as well as for us in our third quarter, we still have November and December in our third quarter. So we were still experiencing expenses related to -- costs related to supply chain disruptions and getting that product to the shelf, though we do see those beginning to ease with our inventories returning to a more normalized level. And then I've already mentioned FX. It will be a headwind for the full year. It negatively impacted us year-to-date at 120 basis points, but we do see a bit of a benefit as we go into the fourth quarter. For our full year, one of the things we are seeing as it relates to the impact of inflation. When we plan this year, we planned it at a -- for inflation to be higher than our average. And in reality, we know it's been well above that, really on our commodities and our energy and fuel. Three notable areas that we do see easing beginning to come, which is in the space of natural gas, specifically in the U.S., it is beginning to decrease significantly in Q4. And even as we look into our Q3 and even as we see into the early parts of Q4, it continues to step down. It's still above the prior year level, but it is beginning to ease. Then I'll also note that with glass prices, though they continue to increase in conjunction with the commodities and the inflation on the commodities takes to build the glass, the significant decline in the U.S. natural gas prices will help moderate the expected increases as we enter F '24. And then lastly, as it relates to freight, we've been talking about freight, transportation, logistics, that from an equipment perspective, it will remain imbalanced and stress, but the cost of fuel has been one of the largest drivers of the transportation costs. And now with the cost of oil that has been volatile, we do see that diesel prices are now below their peak as well. So those are 3 early indicators, kind of some of the easing of the inflation that we have seen, that really is still yet ahead of us to come.OperatorOur next question will come from Nadine Sarwat of Bernstein.Nadine SarwatI want to stick to that gross margin point. So far, we've been talking about what you're seeing at the moment and going into this last quarter. Could you help us understand any of your expectations for gross margins on the medium term? I appreciate you might not want to give explicit guidance, but to the extent that you could give us the puts and takes about where you think you can be trending, including calling out maybe where agave prices are, that would be very helpful. And then lastly, on your impairment, just a follow-up on the Finlandia brand. One of the reasons you called out were higher interest rates. I presume that would impact your entire portfolio when going through that exercise. So could you just give us a little bit more color about your expectations for this brand, in particular, how that's changed and the role you see it play in your portfolio going forward?Leanne D. CunninghamOkay. I will start on a bit more color on the midterm for cost. You're correct, and we're always excited this time of year to begin thinking about and talking about the next fiscal year, but next quarter is when we'll provide significantly more detail on that. I can say and with the commentary that we have is with our distributor and retailer inventories returning to a more normalized level, a significant portion of the cost that we have incurred related to the expedited shipments of our finished goods into the market, we believe that's going to significantly ease as we move forward. That's probably the best thing that I can say for that today. To your comment on agave. Agave, we continue to be -- we've talked about there is strong demand for the category, but we do see greater supply coming on. We are beyond our peak, but we have kind of stabilized around the MXN 28 to MXN 30 per kilo. And for us specifically, our demand has been very strong. So the balance between our internal and external sourcing is for us kind of one of the headwinds we had faced in this year. But again, we do see that supply coming on, and we'll talk more about that in the next quarter as what we think for the next fiscal year.Lawson E. WhitingAnd then on Finlandia, Nadine. So yes, that -- look, a sizable impairment charge is not something that's fun, but obviously, I think you all know it's noncash. What happened was, it's a combination of things. It's the rising interest rates, meant the impairment testing, I mean, that quickly catches on the impairment testing front, and that's what -- that's the major reason that we had to take a second impairment charge on Finlandia. It's also feeling the pressure from higher cost -- its input costs are higher. And then obviously, Russia and then not only Russia, but the countries that touch it all around there are all very, very weak. And so -- it's just been a tough situation. As you all know, it is a regional brand for us. It's not really even sold in much of the world at this point in time anymore. It's a very -- it is an important brand in certain countries, particularly in Eastern Europe. So the suspension of the business in Russia was the biggest single factor that made it so difficult, but we're going to continue trying to improve the performance of the brand and continue to fight through what is a very difficult situation.OperatorOur next question will come from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersI just wanted to go back and maybe round out the gross margin conversation and the cost conversation. I think behind the commentary you gave around your cost pressures year-to-date and where you see things going was very helpful. But I guess, I'm left with the question of just trying to untie how much of what you've experienced and are experiencing is just a byproduct of general cost pressures kind of industry-wide, which I'm sure is the big part [of their] versus how much of what you've incurred maybe specific to Brown-Forman just based on the way your supply chain is configured and the reality is there or procurement timing, contracting realities. I'm just trying to understand how much maybe kind of more unique to you versus the industry. And if there are things that are more unique to you, just as there's any learnings there as you think about the medium to longer term about how you could maybe insulate yourself from some of that volatility, again, to the extent there is a company-specific element there.Leanne D. CunninghamWell, a few things have happened. And when you think about kind of the impact of inflation and supply chain disruption, generally speaking, 2/3, 1/3 -- with the 2/3 being inflation, for us, I mean, I think we've experienced fairly globally the same from inflation. I mean our mix of commodities may be a bit different than other people's commodities, whether we're sourcing domestically in the United States or internationally, and our mix may be a bit different from others. For us, I think we continue to have the opportunity where we have talked about for the last few quarters, and we have taken on some costs as it relates to risk mitigation to our supply chain that you have heard us talk about. As we went through supply chain challenges related to glass, we were intentional about diversifying our supplier base that always comes at a bit of a cost. But again, we thought -- we think and continue to think it will position us well for the future. Again, for the 1/3 related to the supply chain challenges, I've already talked to that. I think that we are moving beyond that as we return our inventories to more normal. Again, one thing that might be a bit different from us is just percent of inventory we have of our business as an aged product that might be a little bit different than others, but we can probably dissect that at different day, but -- what was the last part of your question?Stephen Robert R. PowersNo, actually, I was okay on agave. I think there might have been a question earlier on just sort of what you're seeing on agave, if you've got any comments there.OperatorOur next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citibank.Filippo FalorniI was wondering if you can talk about the consumer trends that you're seeing across the world, particularly in terms of premiumization, whether you're seeing any slowdown. In your prepared remarks, you sound still optimistic about the premiumization trends. But on the margin, are you seeing any change in consumer behavior? And if you can comment on this topic for your key markets, looking about the U.S., Europe and some of your emerging markets.Lawson E. WhitingYes, I'll talk a little bit about -- I mean the consumer demand, I mean, look, it has still remained very, very strong, as you can see just in our top line figures. I think if you -- there's the question around premiumization, which has been happening for 20 years, has been happening in our industry. If we go down to the U.S. market and look about premiumization, it really -- premiumization trends spiked a lot during COVID. They are returning to a little bit more of a normalcy. But if you look at TDS in the United States and you take a look at the breakdown by price point, you'll still see, I'll say, super-premium, ultra-premium growing at a higher rate than say a plain premium, but premium or something down in the standard category. So the story is still true that consumers are premiumizing their purchases and spirits, and that trend has -- is still strong. But if not -- the differential between the 2 is not as strong as it was, I'll say, a couple of years ago. So I hope I explained that right. So you're still seeing the premium trends. It's just the delta between super premium and ultra and then the other price points [down low] has come down a little bit. I think a positive take out of all this, though, is our pricing strategy over the last couple of years, so we're through -- essentially through 2 years of this, of low single-digit, but consistent regular pricing seems to be working pretty well. We think we've got a nice balance between where consumers are willing to take the price increases, where retailers are willing to take the price increases and -- we think it's the smart thing to do over the long term. And so we're going to continue that trend as much as we can. And so far, we have not seen an elasticity that would really make us, say, you know what, I'm not sure that's the right thing to do. We continue to [pull] forward, and I think we're getting a better balance between volume and pricing, which is something we very much want.Filippo FalorniGot it. Anything in particular you're seeing in Europe and emerging markets? Maybe if you can comment on those divisions?Lawson E. WhitingI mean not really. But I would caution, it's difficult to take our trends and extrapolate them to a broad read around the consumers around the world. And that has everything to do with the shipment comparisons that we're dealing with. So if we're only looking at our brands, the shipment comparison, the timing of glass availability, last year, and how we compare against this year sort of dominates our trends more so than what we would say is a read across the consumer moving around. So I know that doesn't really answer your question, but we're just sort of in a unique situation given the volatility that we've seen with glass.OperatorOur next question will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.Kevin Michael GrundyI thought it'd be useful and we spent a little bit of time on U.S. business, so down 10% year-over-year in the quarter, understanding the dynamics around inventory is difficult year-over-year comp. Just a few questions here. Just comment, if you wouldn't mind, how the U.S. business came in relative to your own expectations, understanding you certainly run the business longer term, I think we can appreciate that. But from a quarterly perspective, how it came in. Leanne, you also made comments about normalization of inventory levels. I'm assuming that, that commentary sort of holds for U.S. as well. But if you could just confirm that. And then lastly, just from a consumer demand perspective, maybe just touch on retail takeaway and depletions in the quarter, specifically for the U.S. and then expectations here as we look out in the intermediate term. So that would be helpful.Lawson E. WhitingAll right. Kevin, I'll start it, and then Leanne, you can add on if you want to. Look, it is -- the U.S. market is beginning to normalize. I think we've said that a couple of times, but it's normalizing on a higher base for sure compared to where we were a few years ago. But if you look at TDS right now, it's trending back to the mid-single-digit range, which was where it was for many of the years pre-COVID. So now we delivered 4% in the first 9 months of the year. That was essentially expected. I mean we were plus 11% through the first half. And so we knew a slowdown was coming, and it did -- it fare that way out. It essentially came in relatively close to where we thought. And there is another big factor in this Q3 number for the U.S. And that's -- if you go back to last year, just looking at Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the third quarter of fiscal '22, we were plus 35. So that is a huge number to compare against. And that's because that's -- this -- we're back to the same glass availability topic, where the glass became available in the third quarter. We prioritized Jack over the rest of our portfolio as the on-premise was also opening, and it just was a massive quarter. And so that comparison had a big impact. If you step back and look at Nielsen or NABCA, you can get a much more sort of normalized rate of growth these days. And that would tell us the U.S. market for us is in that 6% range. I think TDS is 5% to 6%, somewhere right around there. And the NABCA numbers are actually even a little bit higher than that. And so we feel pretty good that maybe if it has returned to normal, but normal is still pretty good for the U.S. market. And certainly, we're seeing stronger rates of growth outside of the United States. So I think it's also worth pointing out, at least within our own performance, we're doing a little bit better than TDS, which is something that's a goal that we always have out there. And to be ahead of both Nielsen and NABCA with it -- honestly, it's been a while since we were above it. Once again, a lot of that because of the glass, but it's nice for our teams to know that they're back ahead of TDS.Leanne D. CunninghamAnd then I'll just add 2 things. If you -- all the way back to when we originally planned this fiscal year, you'll recall that we planned for the beginning of normalization with an outlook, a top line organic outlook at mid-single digits, which aligns with our long-term algorithm. That included us cycling the largest impact of the pandemic and also the absence of our Russia business. So as we've gone through, again, all of the prioritization and the strong shipments; in our first half, we had a 5-point benefit year-over-year due to that effort. Now that we're beginning to lap that very strong comparison of our rebuilding the inventory against the prior year and our markets around the world are beginning to normalize, we have a benefit of 2 points. So I think that's worth noting. And then the other thing, I would say, is in the prepared remarks, we talked about the U.S. business inventory being back in line and at a normal level.At the enterprise level, we continue to make significant progress. We continue to see a net increase in distributor inventories. At the same time, it's still having the strong consumer demand. But we still believe, as we said last quarter that by the end of this fiscal year, we would kind of be back at, from the enterprise perspective, a more pretty much normal historical levels of inventory.OperatorOur next question will come from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.Brett Young CooperQuestion for you on distribution or route-to-market. In the U.S., one of your competitors move to beer distributors, United States. Outside the U.S., we're seeing distillers testing alternative routes-to-market whether that be through the Coke bottling network or selling through brewers. And with your business building a relationship with the beer distributors in the U.S., Coke network outside of the U.S., I was wondering if you could speak to or assess your route-to-market potential for changes, and if there's an opportunity to supplement your current efforts?Lawson E. WhitingWell, I'll speak to a little bit at least about the U.S. changes throughout the market. I mean -- we are using [Rye] out in California for our launching a Jack and Coke, so that's something that is quite a bit different. But we're still very much in partnership with Breakthru and RNDC for the most -- as our largest 2 partners in the U.S. And that business, as you can see through the numbers, it remains pretty strong. We also made the change 2 years ago with past -- I think, it was what it was. That was all about getting with a distributor partner that was able to reach all these points of retailers that are able to sell malt products which is Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails and that has been an enormous benefit to that brand. And so I think our -- we are testing different models in the United States. When you leave the U.S., it's very different. That story has all been about us sort of forward integrating and being responsible for our own route-to-market. And we've -- and we say, 5 markets in the last 2 years, something like that. So we continue to be pretty agile and try to mix it up and try different changes or different models and different partnerships. And I think overall, that's had a pretty healthy impact on our business, really not even over the last year, but over the last decade or so, it's been a pretty meaningful impact.OperatorOur next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanI wanted to ask a sort of backward-looking question, but [in forming] the forward. And just that in hindsight, it maybe seems like you had greater supply chain issues or glass constraints than some of your peers in the industry. And I just say that based on -- as you've talked through reasons for the gap between your performance in TDS previously and that now kind of catching up. So just looking backwards to look forward, are there changes you're making in terms of supply chain, relationships with suppliers, et cetera, or the way that you manage inventory in-house thoughts and with distributors to make sure that you're not in that position again.Leanne D. CunninghamWell, we can start with -- in comparison to TDS, again, we've talked many times, and again, around how we were impacted and then how we prioritize our brands of how -- based of the opportunities that were available at the time. So with the glass supply capacity that we had, we wanted to prioritize Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey with the reopening of the on-premise. Quickly thereafter, we prioritize Woodford Reserve to have that brand available. And so as we went through that prioritization, it -- as Lawson has said many times, it's made it very, very hard to compare our results and our takeaway trends compared to TDS. Now what we have done is, again, you've heard me talk about, we have done a few things on the supply chain side of our business. We have invested in new technologies to give us greater visibility. And we are implementing new processes. I think, Lauren, when we were together, we talked about actually new processes related to forecasting and planning demand. And then from a cost perspective, we've also incurred some costs to diversify our supply chain, specifically around glass supply. But then we've also brought in new tools and learned new ways of expediting our products to market when and where that's needed.Lawson E. WhitingYes. I mean I think we've said this on some prior calls, too, but we were nearly 100% with 1 partner for glass supply. And when you talk about Jack Daniel's and Woodford, you're looking at a U.S. supplier of glass for the world. And when that 1 supplier began to really struggle, it impacted us greatly, and we didn't have anywhere else to turn. And so -- it has taken -- it's been about a year since we, in earnest, found some other partners. And so we are diversifying. We're still heavily reliant on that 1 supplier. But we're trying to diversify a bit. So once again, so we don't get caught in this again, although I must say, we were with that same supplier for 100 years and not had any problems before that. So it was very much a COVID-driven crazy volatile world that caused a lot of these problems.OperatorThank you. This is all the time we have allotted for questions. I will now turn the conference back to Sue Perram for closing remarks.Susanne J. PerramWell, thank you.

If you want to read about some more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.While we all might love the idea of investing in risk-free stocks, there's no such thing as a stock that's 100% safe. Even the best companies can face unexpected trouble, and it's common for even the most stable corporations to get shaken up due to significant price volatility. This was evident during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when many strong companies experienced dramatic drops in stock prices. More recently, we saw this phenomenon in 2022 when rising interest rates, inflation, and international conflict shook the stock market.Although 2023 started off on a decent note, the same can't be claimed for the rest of the year if Barclays Capital Inc.'s predictions are anything to go by. The investment advisory firm says that 2023 will go down as one of the worst for the world economy in four decades. Additionally, Ned Davis Research Inc. puts the odds of a severe global downturn at 65%. However, most investment firms agree that the year will be incredibly uneven, with Deutsche Bank AG seeing the S&amp;P 500 Index rising to about 4,500 in the first half, before falling 25% in the third quarter as a downturn bites — only to jump back up to 4,500 by end-2023 as certain investors tailgate a recovery.Long-term investors ignore the agitating, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwinds of uncertainty, they buy the shares of stable companies with reliable performance that’s measured in years, or even decades. Although still subject to volatility like every other stock, these recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In) include household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Story continues10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial StabilityPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of more than 940 hedge funds and picked the top 10 stocks that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The company’s systemwide sales rose 5% on a year-over-year basis, while its global comparable sales rose 10.9% year-over-year in 2022. Although the fast-food chain stated that the currency rate has been fluctuating quite a bit, it sees its FY23 capital expenditures to be around $2.2-$2.4 billion. Additionally, at the end of January, the company revealed plans to open 1900 new restaurants this year globally on a gross basis.On February 17, Loop Capital analyst Alton Stump maintained a Buy rating and $328 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in addition to raising his Q1 growth estimates in the U.S. to 7.5% from 5.5% and FY23 estimates to 4.9% from 4.4%. The analyst cited his latest McDonald's U.S. franchisee checks indicating that same-store sales growth is once again off to a strong start to date in Q1.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 53 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 2 million shares worth $529.3 million.Much like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered a relatively safe bet.9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company offers more than 200 brands—from sodas to waters, from coffees to teas, from juices to kombuchas, and a growing list of flavored alcohol beverages — in more than 200 countries and territories .The beverage giant announced its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares February 15. According to the analyst, the company’s “robust” 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company’s 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 59 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, with 400 million shares.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage. Through its subsidiaries, the company generates clean, emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power units in Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.Earlier this January, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised the price target on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to $110 from $105 on higher assumed NEER capital investment opportunities, influenced by his Generation Outlook 2050 analysis. While he believes that renewables are the key driver of NEER's growth, he adds that other decarbonization-related verticals are emerging. Kalton maintained an Overweight rating on the shares of the company.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was popular among elite funds in Q4 2022, as 61 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.15 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States. On January 5, the retail giant announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022. The company completed more than 6,000 deliveries via drone during the year from its 36 drone delivery hubs across seven states.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $180 from $175 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst raised his estimates on prospects of better sales trends and the likelihood of solid store traffic trends, particularly in January.Evercore ISI added Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to the firm's ""Tactical Outperform"" list on February 17, noting that the stock has lagged the S&amp;P and S&amp;P Retail Index by 5% and 17%, respectively, year-to-date. The firm believes that a 2023 guide down is likely already reflected in the stock performance and sees upside to Q4 results driven by stronger sales and share gains in grocery.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), compared to 68 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q4 2022 increased to $4.85 billion from $4 billion in Q3 2022.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the ""Costco Wholesale"" name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.On February 2, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $568 from $538 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Costco's January sales were ""solid"", and its extreme value proposition will enable the company to continue gaining more members and market share, particularly if the economy continues to soften.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $1.12 billion.Similar to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has historically provided investors with protection against market downturns.Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.  Suggested articles:10 High Growth AI Stocks To Buy11 High Growth IT Stocks to Buy10 Most Promising Blockchain StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Warren Buffett earned $704M in dividends from Coca-Cola in 2022 — here are 3 more income stocks in the portfolioIt’s no secret that Warren Buffett has made billions from his investment in Coca-Cola.Don't missUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classHere's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare?You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)His company Berkshire Hathaway has held Coca-Cola in its portfolio since the late ’80s. But other than having benefited from the beverage giant’s rising share price over the decades, Berkshire continues to collect dividends from the investment.And the amount might surprise you.Coca-Cola paid four quarterly dividends totaling $1.76 per share in 2022. Berkshire held 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola in 2022, allowing it to earn $704 million in dividends from the company.The figure caught the attention of Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, who tweeted “Berkshire Hathaway high on Coke.”The best part? With dividend investing, there’s no need to worry about the stock market’s ups and downs. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19.4% in 2022, but investors who held high-quality dividend stocks in their portfolios still got paid.Coca-Cola isn’t the only company that Buffett collects dividends from. Here’s a look at three other Berkshire holdings that are distributing generous amounts of cash to investors.KrogerIn an era where physical stores are under serious threat from online merchants, Kroger (KR) remains a brick-and-mortar beast.In 2022, the company’s same-store sales without fuel increased by 5.6%.The economy moves in cycles, but people always need to shop for food. As a result, Kroger can make money through our economy’s ups and downs.You can see Kroger’s resilience in its dividend history: the company has increased its payout to shareholders for 16 consecutive years.Paying a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share, Kroger offers an annual yield of 2.3%.Story continuesAs of Dec. 31, 2022, Berkshire owned 50,000,000 shares of the company.Read more: Here's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up?Johnson &amp; JohnsonWith deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Not only does Johnson &amp; Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.The stock has been trending up for decades, all while returning an increasing amount of cash to shareholders. JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase last April and now yields 2.9%.At the end of December, Buffett’s company held 327,100 shares of JNJ.Procter &amp; GambleBerkshire also owned 315,400 shares of Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) at the end of 2022 — a company with an even longer dividend growth track record than JNJ.P&amp;G announced a 5% dividend increase in April 2022, marking its 66th consecutive annual payout increase.

Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&amp;P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time.Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&amp;P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7.In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some other dividend companies with long dividend growth streaks.In February, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's organic sales.At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $28.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 107 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 27International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), also known as Big Blue, is a New York-based technology company that has operations in over 175 countries.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. PPG Industries, Inc.

(NYSE:PPG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter.

Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.  Suggested articles:15 Best Small Cap Stocks Ready to Explode11 Most Profitable Pot Stocks Now11 High Growth Monthly Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Companies that Just Started Paying DividendsMotley Fool's High Growth Stock Picks13 High Growth Consumer Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Incyte's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Incyte How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Incyte is:7.8% = US$341m ÷ US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Incyte's Earnings Growth And 7.8% ROEWhen you first look at it, Incyte's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 25% either. In spite of this, Incyte was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 46% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Incyte's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 32% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Incyte's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Incyte Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Incyte doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Incyte certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The primary endpoint of LIMBER-304 was the proportion of patients who achieved a targeted reduction in spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who had a targeted reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS), change in TSS, time to the first ≥50% reduction in TSS, overall survival, number of treatment-emergent adverse events, time of onset of the targeted reduction in spleen volume and the duration of the targeted reduction in spleen volume maintenance.The LIMBER clinical trial program is evaluating multiple monotherapy and combination strategies to improve and expand treatments for patients with MPNs and GVHD. These include ruxolitinib-based combinations with BET and ALK2, new therapeutic options including axatilimab and novel targets such as mutant CALR.Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is Incyte’s lead drug and is approved for polycythemiavera, MF and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.Incyte recently reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, driven by growth in patient demand for the lead drug, Jakafi, higher royalty revenues and encouraging uptake of other recently approved drugs.The successful development of other drugs will add an incremental stream of revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi.Story continuesIncyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi, which is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.While Jakafi’s sales and royalties are key catalysts for the company’s revenue growth, Iclusig’s sales and Olumiant’s royalties from Eli Lilly LLY also contribute to the top line.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly for Olumiant.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Waste Management (NYSE:WM) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Waste Management is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$31b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.9% generated by the Commercial Services industry. View our latest analysis for Waste Management roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Waste Management compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Waste Management.So How Is Waste Management's ROCE Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 45% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 13%. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Waste Management's ROCEIn the end, Waste Management has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 90% to shareholders over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Waste Management   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

712,ccbc0d5f-0063-31c7-b9e6-16881ea8ebc6,INTU,2023-03-09,30 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-biggest-saas-companies-world-164842565.html,1678294122,STORY,"['NOW', 'ADBE', 'INTU', 'OKTA', 'RMD', 'CRM', 'DOCU', 'DDOG', 'NET', 'ZM', 'MDB', 'PAYX', 'TWLO', 'PTC', 'PLTR', 'HUBS', 'CRWD', 'ZS', 'SPLK', 'ADSK', 'VEEV', 'PAYC']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 30 biggest SaaS companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 10 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World. The software as a service (SaaS) industry is one of the hottest sectors in the technology sector right now. The growth of the Internet and connectivity in general has created new business models and allowed existing businesses to transform their operations and take advantage of external products and processes without having to deal with large capital investment for their own systems. This allows firms to streamline their daily processes such as human resources and payroll and take advantage of specialized services. At the same time, it generates new business models where entire businesses are set up to facilitate other businesses or professionals at carrying out their operations.These diverse use cases and the fact that the industry itself still hasn't fully matured lead to some optimistic valuations and growth estimates for the SaaS sector. One such estimate comes from Market Research Future, with the firm estimating that the SaaS industry is estimated to grow to $381 billion by the end of this decade from the start and through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.3%. This growth and the strong valuation for a software subscription platform that does not have the luxury of high product prices like the hardware industry does is still unsurprising given that some of the biggest technology companies in the world such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) have dedicated cloud computing divisions. This growth is also fueled by the relatively easier adaptability of the SaaS platforms, as Market Research Future points out that firms find it easier to access complex software products via the cloud instead of spending heavily to develop such capabilities in house.Another more optimistic estimate for the SaaS industry comes from FinancialNewsMedia. This research firm believes that the industry was worth $121 billion in 2020 and from then until it will grow at a stronger CAGR of 18.8% to be worth $702 billion by the end of 2023.Story continuesHowever, despite these rosy estimates, the SaaS sector is still a technology industry and as such is subject to macroeconomic pitfalls. These days inflation and high interest rates are restricting corporate budgets and cloud computing spending is also dropping as a result. Yet, SaaS companies are adamant that their business is growing, with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)'s chief executive officer Mr. William McDermott highlighting during a recent earnings call that:C-level buyers don’t want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, “We can’t afford 1,000 points of We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.” So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow. This begins with our business model. ServiceNow with born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world.Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation. . . . .Right now, many technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest SaaS companies in the world, out of which the top picks are Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).30 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World in 2023Our Methodology We started to compile our list by searching for the largest SaaS companies that operate in North America, Australia, China, and Europe after which they were ranked through their market capitalization or estimated valuation.

If you want to read about some more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.While we all might love the idea of investing in risk-free stocks, there's no such thing as a stock that's 100% safe. Even the best companies can face unexpected trouble, and it's common for even the most stable corporations to get shaken up due to significant price volatility. This was evident during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when many strong companies experienced dramatic drops in stock prices. More recently, we saw this phenomenon in 2022 when rising interest rates, inflation, and international conflict shook the stock market.Although 2023 started off on a decent note, the same can't be claimed for the rest of the year if Barclays Capital Inc.'s predictions are anything to go by. The investment advisory firm says that 2023 will go down as one of the worst for the world economy in four decades. Additionally, Ned Davis Research Inc. puts the odds of a severe global downturn at 65%. However, most investment firms agree that the year will be incredibly uneven, with Deutsche Bank AG seeing the S&amp;P 500 Index rising to about 4,500 in the first half, before falling 25% in the third quarter as a downturn bites — only to jump back up to 4,500 by end-2023 as certain investors tailgate a recovery.Long-term investors ignore the agitating, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwinds of uncertainty, they buy the shares of stable companies with reliable performance that’s measured in years, or even decades. Although still subject to volatility like every other stock, these recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In) include household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Story continues10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial StabilityPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of more than 940 hedge funds and picked the top 10 stocks that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The company’s systemwide sales rose 5% on a year-over-year basis, while its global comparable sales rose 10.9% year-over-year in 2022. Although the fast-food chain stated that the currency rate has been fluctuating quite a bit, it sees its FY23 capital expenditures to be around $2.2-$2.4 billion. Additionally, at the end of January, the company revealed plans to open 1900 new restaurants this year globally on a gross basis.On February 17, Loop Capital analyst Alton Stump maintained a Buy rating and $328 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in addition to raising his Q1 growth estimates in the U.S. to 7.5% from 5.5% and FY23 estimates to 4.9% from 4.4%. The analyst cited his latest McDonald's U.S. franchisee checks indicating that same-store sales growth is once again off to a strong start to date in Q1.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 53 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 2 million shares worth $529.3 million.Much like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered a relatively safe bet.9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company offers more than 200 brands—from sodas to waters, from coffees to teas, from juices to kombuchas, and a growing list of flavored alcohol beverages — in more than 200 countries and territories .The beverage giant announced its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares February 15. According to the analyst, the company’s “robust” 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company’s 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 59 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, with 400 million shares.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage. Through its subsidiaries, the company generates clean, emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power units in Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.Earlier this January, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised the price target on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to $110 from $105 on higher assumed NEER capital investment opportunities, influenced by his Generation Outlook 2050 analysis. While he believes that renewables are the key driver of NEER's growth, he adds that other decarbonization-related verticals are emerging. Kalton maintained an Overweight rating on the shares of the company.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was popular among elite funds in Q4 2022, as 61 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.15 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States. On January 5, the retail giant announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022. The company completed more than 6,000 deliveries via drone during the year from its 36 drone delivery hubs across seven states.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $180 from $175 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst raised his estimates on prospects of better sales trends and the likelihood of solid store traffic trends, particularly in January.Evercore ISI added Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to the firm's ""Tactical Outperform"" list on February 17, noting that the stock has lagged the S&amp;P and S&amp;P Retail Index by 5% and 17%, respectively, year-to-date. The firm believes that a 2023 guide down is likely already reflected in the stock performance and sees upside to Q4 results driven by stronger sales and share gains in grocery.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), compared to 68 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q4 2022 increased to $4.85 billion from $4 billion in Q3 2022.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the ""Costco Wholesale"" name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.On February 2, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $568 from $538 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Costco's January sales were ""solid"", and its extreme value proposition will enable the company to continue gaining more members and market share, particularly if the economy continues to soften.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $1.12 billion.Similar to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has historically provided investors with protection against market downturns.Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.  Suggested articles:10 High Growth AI Stocks To Buy11 High Growth IT Stocks to Buy10 Most Promising Blockchain StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.EssilorLuxottica Unsponsored ADR and Stryker are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ESLOY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ESLOY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.50, while SYK has a forward P/E of 26.42. We also note that ESLOY has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. SYK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.72.Another notable valuation metric for ESLOY is its P/B ratio of 1.79. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SYK has a P/B of 6.03.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, ESLOY holds a Value grade of B, while SYK has a Value grade of C.ESLOY sticks out from SYK in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ESLOY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFiserv’s valuation multiples don’t appear stretched, with the current 16.1X forward earnings multiple sitting well beneath the 22.5X five-year median and the Zacks Business Services sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s hard to ignore the company’s growth trajectory, with estimates suggesting 12.6% year-over-year earnings growth in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 14% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted year-over-year revenue upticks of 6% in FY23 and 9% in FY24. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on an annual basis.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisaA multinational financial services company and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Visa facilitates electronic funds transfers through Visa-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards.Visa posted a strong quarter in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 8% and reporting revenue 3.4% above expectations.The market was certainly pleased with the results, sending shares on an upward trajectory. This is illustrated by the green arrow in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Visa shares provide an income stream; V’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, a tick below the Zacks Business Services sector average.Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by more than 15% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd for the cherry on top, Visa is a cash-generating machine; V reported free cash flow of $3.9 billion in its latest release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStryker Corp.Stryker is a medical device company operating in the global orthopedic market. Like the stocks above, SYK sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares got a big boost following Stryker’s latest quarterly release. The company posted earnings of $3.00 per share, nearly 6% above expectations.Quarterly revenue totaled $5.2 billion, 5% ahead of estimates and growing 10.7% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to V, Stryker shares pay a dividend, currently yielding 1.1% annually. While the yield is below the Zacks Medical sector average, SYK’s 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith an upcoming jobs report and investors digesting Powell’s testimony, it’s reasonable to expect a heightened level of volatility throughout the week.In uncertain times, low-beta stocks, including Fiserv FISV, Visa V, and Stryker SYK, can help shield investors from spooky price swings.In addition to being low-beta, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating an optimistic near-term outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, pricing pressure remains a headwind.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 28.5% compared with the industry’s 2.3% increase in the past six months. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 0.7% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $102.86 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 9.7% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.7% compares favorably with the industry’s 0% yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, courtesy of the platform’s unique features, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. These, in turn, position it well to sustain the momentum in robot sales.Stryker is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. Following a soft third-quarter in 2022, the Mako installations touched record-high during the fourth quarter. The company remains confident of robust growth in Mako revenues in 2023 on the back of new launches and software upgrades. The company is also progressing well with Mako in international markets. The company is focused on the continued expansion of the platform. This growth reflects the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Additionally, Stryker has a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products shields the company against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Its significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped the company stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Stryker’s portfolio includes products like Hip, Knee and Mako robotic-arm assisted surgeries.On its fourth-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely impacted last year due to COVID. However, hospital staffing pressures remained in certain regions. It expects hospital staffing pressure to resolve gradually, leading to higher procedures in 2023.Story continuesPer management, the company’s sustained support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 6.7% of net sales, highlighting its sustained commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches. In September, Stryker launched its new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System— for spine application. On its fourth quarter earnings call, the company stated that the Q Guidance system has exceeded management’s expectations.Moreover, Stryker’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and actions to lessen the inflationary pressure look promising.

On the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the quarter’s average selling days were in line with the prior-year period. The impact from pricing was 0.6% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern. Moreover, unfavorable currency rate fluctuation also hurt top line growth, which may continue to impact revenues moderately in the first half of 2023.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $10.02, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.3%.

But in tandem with International Women's Day, the celebration of women should be an important reminder of women who struggle daily with housing costs and honor those who have overcome overwhelming obstacles to gain access to proper shelter, as well as the women who continue to seek adequate shelter for their families.Whirlpool Corporation, Wednesday, March 8, 2023, Press release pictureOn average, women are disproportionately impacted by inadequate and unsafe housing. Nearly one in three single mothers live below the poverty line. In the U.S., one in six families must choose between having a place to call home, pay for food, health care, childcare, education or reliable transportation.Meet JannettaJannetta's home in Kansas City, Missouri was unsafe and unhealthy for her and her family. ""The roof caved in six times. It was drafty and poorly insulated. My bathroom pipes would freeze every time it was below 30 degrees, so I would have to crawl under the house with a hairdryer to thaw them. If I waited for the landlord, it would be days before he'd fix it.""Beyond high energy bills and ever-increasing rent, Jannetta's home was too small to fit her family's needs. Her grandchildren, who visited on the weekends didn't have room to play, and there was no space for her mother, for whom Jannetta provides daily care.Jannetta applied to the Habitat for Humanity of Kansas City homeownership program and was approved. In 2022, with the help of a team of volunteers comprised solely of women, Jannetta built her new home. She said, ""I'm through with paying rent. The cost is always going up and you're not getting anything for it."" Her new home has enabled Jannetta to achieve her dream of providing a safe home for her family.Women, families and Habitat for Humanity's missionWomen and families are an integral part of Habitat for Humanity's mission, with housing at the center of well-being for individuals and families, which is why Habitat is a steadfast advocate for women, and particularly minority women, in their journeys to homeownership.Story continuesWith the support of partners like Whirlpool Corporation, Habitat reduces barriers to home ownership around the world through the following programs:Habitat Builds serve women and families by increasing access to affordable housing. The majority of U.S. households served by Habitat for Humanity are female-led and most of these households are led by a woman who identify as Black or African American. In response to this need, new home construction and repair work for female-led households has steadily increased over the last five years. This work is also impacting family members in need, as female-led households are more likely to have dependents, a person over 65 and/or a person with disabilities living in the household.Outside the U.S., the Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter (TCIS), part of Habitat for Humanity International, expands low-income families' access to innovative housing products, services and financing. TCIS is currently working with Whirlpool Corporation in Mexico to explore washing machine solutions for families in rural areas where access to electricity and clean water is limited. Whirlpool Corp. is proud to partner with Habitat and TCIS on what could potentially be another innovative solution that empowers women and provides the tools needed to break these cycles of poverty.In Kenya, a housing microfinancing project through TCIS is creating positive impact on women's livelihoods, health, and standards of living, while building confidence, skills and decision-making power. The financial stability of participating women improved, from using their property as a productive asset, to freeing up previous rent payments, to having more time for business activity through improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and energy solutions. Together with the increased income, having a decent and stable home enabled the women's children to pursue education longer and the investment in clean energy, cooking and WASH facilities led to improved diets, cleaner homes and reduction in water-borne and respiratory diseases.Habitat's Women Build was developed in 1991, in recognition of the overwhelming power of women to make a difference in their communities and for one another. The program empowers women to help families build strength, stability and independence by offering them the opportunity to take a proactive step in serving and changing their communities through hands-on learning. In developing countries, this is done through partnerships with organizations to assist in bringing the full rights and responsibilities of homeownership to women.Women Build also supports Habitat's advocacy programs by collecting information on the challenges, particularly with property rights, that women face worldwide. Through Women Build, Habitat is increasing advocacy efforts on these important issues and demonstrating the many benefits of female ownership.Thanks to partners like Whirlpool Corporation, together, we are making the cost of a house something women, like Jannetta, around the world can all afford and the reality of a home possible to achieve.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Whirlpool CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/whirlpool-corporation Email: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Whirlpool CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742794/Empowering-Women-to-Transform-Their-Lives-and-Communities]"

(NYSE:LYB) Suggests It's 22% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-lyondellbasell-industries-n-140011707.html,1678111211,STORY,['LYB'],"[Key InsightsLyondellBasell Industries' estimated fair value is US$125 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityLyondellBasell Industries is estimated to be 22% undervalued based on current share price of US$97.24 The US$102 analyst price target for LYB is 18% less than our estimate of fair valueDoes the March share price for LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.65bUS$3.17bUS$3.18bUS$3.11bUS$3.09bUS$3.09bUS$3.11bUS$3.14bUS$3.18bUS$3.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x10Analyst x5Est @ -2.09%Est @ -0.84%Est @ 0.03%Est @ 0.64%Est @ 1.07%Est @ 1.37%Est @ 1.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$2.4kUS$2.7kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$21bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$41b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$97.2, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.143. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LyondellBasell IndustriesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

This improvement was driven by higher earned premiums, other revenues and investment income. Also, the top line surpassed the consensus mark by 0.7%.Net written premiums climbed 10% year over year to $1.7 billion, attributable largely to premium growth initiatives, price increases and a higher level of insured exposures. The figure is higher than our estimate of $1.6 billion.

The figure is higher than our estimate of $196.1 million.Total benefits and expenses of Cincinnati Financial increased 23.7% year over year to $1.8 billion, primarily because of higher insurance losses and contract holders’ benefits and underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses.

This insurer will now pay 33 cents per share to shareholders of record on Mar 16. The dividend will be paid out on Mar 31.This increased dividend translates to an annualized payout of $1.32 per share. Based on the stock’s Mar 7 closing price of $36.55, the new dividend will yield nearly 3.6%, better than the industry average of 2.2%. With 41.8 million shares outstanding at 2022 end, the company will have to dish out $13.8 million quarterly to pay the dividend.The recent approval marks the 15th consecutive yearly hike, reflecting operational excellence and commitment to return value to its shareholders. Its dividend witnessed a 15-year CAGR of about 10%. The company’s strategic focus on designing products to capitalize on the potential opportunity in the K-12 educator market, annuity reinsurance agreement, profitable in-force block, high quality and well-diversified investment portfolio, and cost-saving initiatives are likely to help Horace Mann increase dividends. HMN targets a 50% dividend payout ratio.Apart from dividend hikes, HMN also engages in share buybacks. It bought back shares worth $24 million in 2022 with $41.3 million remaining under authorization as of Dec 31, 2022. Solid operational performance driven by growth across all segments and continued share repurchases should help the insurer achieve its core earnings guidance of $2.00 to $2.30 per share in 2023.Its solid financial foundation and operational performance will continue to generate capital, thereby aiding Horace Mann to engage in shareholder-friendly moves apart from investing in business growth at returns that meet or exceed its return on equity targets. The insurer estimates generating excess capital of $50 million annually. Horace Mann estimates generating double-digit core ROE by 2024 as core EPS approaches $4.Shares of Horace Mann have lost 11.7% in a year versus the industry’s decrease of 2%. Transformational actions, profitability initiatives and niche market focus are likely to help shares bounce back.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHMN currently carries Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Given the solid capital level of the insurance industry and improving operating backdrop favoring strong operational performance, insurers like Chubb Limited CB, Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF and Radian Group RDN have resorted to effective capital deployment.Chubb’s board looks to increase its annual dividend by 3.6%. Historically, Chubb’s dividends have witnessed an eight-year CAGR (2022-2023) of 2.4%. Its dividend yield of 1.6% betters the industry average of 0.3%. Chubb has maintained a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, including consistent cash flow generation, for the past many years. The insurer’s cash flow has been increasing over the years. This has paved the way for prudent capital deployment measures.Cincinnati Financial’s board of directors approved a dividend of 75 cents per share for the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a 9% increase.  This action sets the stage for the 63rd consecutive year of dividend hike. This reflects Cincinnati Financial’s strong operating performance, the board's positive outlook and confidence in outstanding capital, liquidity and financial flexibility.The board of directors of Radian Group approved a 12.5% hike in its annual dividend. With this, the payout now stands at 22.5 cents per share. This is the fourth consecutive year where RDN has increased the quarterly dividend with a total increase of 80% over the past three years. The multi-line insurer maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows. A strong capital position helps Radian Group deploy capital via share repurchases and dividend hikes that enhance shareholders’ value. Radian’s solid cash flow also looks impressive.Shares of CB have gained 1.4% in a year while that of CINF and RDN lost 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively in the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Planemakers have struggled to raise production, so jets are being retired later than anticipated.Story continuesSupply and labor shortages have hurt jet engine output, with CEO Culp saying it was a daily battle to meet jet engine demand.Nearly half of the industry's most popular jet engines have not seen the first shop visit, GE said.GE said it was aligned with Boeing and Airbus on demand for LEAP jet engines through 2024, adding that 2025 supplies were being discussed as part of a standard process.Engines supplied by CFM International, GE's joint venture with France's Safran SA, power Boeing's 737 MAX jets and about half of Airbus' A320/321neo family.The comments imply a commitment to support Airbus plans to lift narrow-body output to 65 jets a month from 45, but leave question marks over the planemaker's further push to take it to 75 a month. Airbus last month said it could reach production of 65 a month by the end of 2024 and plans to hit 75 a month in 2026.Airbus has said it is confident that demand for jets would support the higher production rate but has given itself another year to get there, compared with earlier proposals, due to supply chain pressures.GE Vernova, the company's portfolio of energy businesses, including renewables, is expected to report an operating loss of between $200 million and $600 million in 2023.The troubled renewable business is expected to be profitable in 2024, GE said.

It reported a loss of $2.2 billion last year.Analysts have raised questions about whether GE may be forced to alter a plan to spin off GE Vernova into a separate company next year, including a possible delay or changing which assets are included.GE Chief Executive Larry Culp has acknowledged the renewables business requires ""wiring and plumbing"" before the spin-off.""I want to kind of understand is there any chance at all that Vernova will not include GE wind,"" William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.GE is prioritizing the turnaround of its onshore wind business and has reduced the unit's global headcount by about 20% in a restructuring and resizing that is expected to produce savings this year.Nonetheless, although tax credits for wind projects offered under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have boosted demand in North America, the company doesn't expect a meaningful improvement in the onshore business in the first half of 2023.GE also faces challenges in offshore wind since it was barred from making and selling its Haliade-X wind turbines in the U.S. after a jury found they infringed a patent owned by rival Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy.Story continuesBernstein analyst Brendan Luecke expects GE's renewables business to post another loss this year.But overall, GE is expected to reiterate its 2023 adjusted earnings outlook of $1.60 to $2.00 per share on Thursday.The aerospace business, which supplies engines to Airbus and Boeing, is grappling with shortages of labor, parts and raw materials.The unit, GE's cash cow, had unfilled customer orders worth $135 billion at the end of 2022, up 8% from the prior year.GE has deployed hundreds of employees to its aerospace suppliers' sites to ease the bottlenecks but there has been no material improvement in the situation.""GE has made great progress, but risks remain,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; Editing by Ben Klayman, Kirsten Donovan)]"

Southwest will use AWS to power elements of its website and mobile app, store data and run internal analytics. The companies declined to discuss financial terms of the multiyear deal.Southwest already runs some software on AWS, including gate management and departure control programs, said Lauren Woods, the low-cost airline’s chief information officer. “We definitely have plans to do other critical-for-operations and future required-to-fly applications, bringing those into AWS,” Woods said.Southwest faced widespread criticism from customers and industry regulators and was called before a congressional committee after it scrubbed more than 16,700 flights in the final 10 days of December. At the time, the Dallas-based airline was contending with a powerful winter storm that moved across the northern US, grounding flights and causing Southwest to lose track of its aircraft and flight crews.The situation became so bad that the airline canceled the majority of its schedule over several days to reset its flight network, affecting more than 2 million passengers. The meltdown will cost the airline at least $1.15 billion over two quarters due to scrapped reservations, reduced bookings and higher costs.Story continuesAmazon and Southwest were having talks to expand their relationship before the scheduling fiasco, said Matt Garman, AWS’s senior vice president of sales and marketing. “It’s not like this stuff happened in December and they jumped with us,” he said. “It’s really kind of a full modernization of a lot of their flight operations.”AWS is the world’s largest cloud provider, selling rented computing power, data storage and software services to businesses — including some that have decommissioned their own data centers in favor of Amazon’s server farms. The company often touts deals with marquee customers like airlines. United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. also named AWS their preferred cloud partner in recent years.Southwest has said that its existing technology didn’t fail during the December disruptions, but that cancellations built so rapidly that crew scheduling software from GE Digital, a unit of General Electric Co., was overwhelmed. That software was upgraded in February to correct the deficiency. Woods was named Southwest’s CIO on Feb. 1.Southwest is the target of a federal probe into whether the carrier’s scheduling violated rules forbidding unfair and deceptive practices when it left millions stranded. The airline is awaiting the results of a report it commissioned from consultant Oliver Wyman on what went wrong.Woods said Southwest plans to maintain its own data center, in part to keep its options open to run some of the applications from its wide range of software vendors.“The footprint may get smaller,” she said. “I just don’t see it going to zero.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNext Big Job Cuts Will Be in Finance and Health Care, Data ShowThe Digital Age Ushers in a Speedier, More Viral Breed of Bank RunThe Biggest Winner of the Gas Stove Fight Is Induction RangesThe Promise of Higher Pay Woos MBAs, Yet Earnings Haven’t Kept Up With InflationEven Wealthy Landlords Are Skipping Payments on Office Buildings©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

It is a profitability ratio, which measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity.To shortlist these gems, one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks.

The positive response could be attributed to the company’s earnings beat and shareholder-firendly initiatives.What Did APA’s Earnings Unveil?APA reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 and increasing from the year-ago quarter’s income of $1.29.The quarterly numbers reflect a lower operating expense and higher-than-expected production. Precisely, the average daily output came in at 414,435 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), ahead of the consensus mark of 405,000 BOE/d.Revenues of $2.4 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion but edged down 1% from the year-ago quarter’s sales due to sharply lower gas realizations.As promised, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. APA bought back 12.1 million shares at $44.40 apiece during the fourth quarter. The company also shelled out $80 million in dividend payment.APA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAPA Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAPA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | APA Corporation Quote Production &amp; Selling PricesProduction of oil and natural gas averaged 414,435 BOE/d, which comprises 64% liquids. The figure increased 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.U.S. output (accounting for 53% of the total) fell 4.5% year over year to 217,830 BOE/d but production from the company’s international operations increased some 24.7% to 196,605 BOE/d. APA’s oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production was 267,073 barrels per day (Bbl/d). Natural gas output totaled 884,169 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d).The average realized crude oil price during the fourth quarter was $86.17 per barrel, up 9.7% from the year-ago realization of $78.52. However, the number came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88. Meanwhile, the average realized natural gas price fell to $4.04 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $4.95 in the year-ago period and badly missed the consensus mark of $5.69.Story continuesCosts &amp; Financial PositionAPA’s fourth-quarter lease operating expenses totaled $377 million, up 7.7% from the year-ago period. However, a significant decline in costs of oil and gas purchased meant that total operating expenses fell 9.8% from the corresponding period of 2021 to $1.6 billion.During the quarter under review, APA generated $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities while it incurred $486 million in upstream capital expenditures. The company reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. It also registered a free cash flow of $360 million during the period, though it was down from $466 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, APA had approximately $245 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $5.5 billion in long-term debt.

739,ccff2b6b-11ca-3793-9d72-583e00f1d7e7,VLO,2023-03-09,Does This Valuation Of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-valero-energy-corporation-110014197.html,1678273214,STORY,['VLO'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Valero Energy fair value estimate is US$105Valero Energy's US$137 share price signals that it might be 30% overvalued Analyst price target for VLO is US$156, which is 48% above our fair value estimateHow far off is Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.53bUS$5.80bUS$4.24bUS$3.43bUS$3.00bUS$2.75bUS$2.61bUS$2.53bUS$2.50bUS$2.49bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Est @ -18.97%Est @ -12.66%Est @ -8.24%Est @ -5.15%Est @ -2.98%Est @ -1.47%Est @ -0.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$7.8kUS$4.8kUS$3.2kUS$2.4kUS$1.9kUS$1.6kUS$1.4kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$975(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$39b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$137, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.303. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

740,24f1af65-762c-325e-86e6-ed2cbe72b83c,VLO,2023-03-09,Oil is Breaking out: 3 Energy Stocks to Buy Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-breaking-3-energy-stocks-212809039.html,1678138089,STORY,"['VLO', 'MPC']","[Energy markets have been mostly quiet for the last few quarters. After the tremendous run up to $130 per barrel at the onset of the Russia - Ukraine War, prices have cooled off significantly. But it looks like the oil bull market is about to start up again.After trading in a tight range for the last three months oil prices look like they are breaking out. A rally in oil will have many significant implications. Of course, the stocks of energy companies will benefit, as with high oil prices come higher margins, but there is more to it than that. If oil prices rise significantly, it will have a strong effect on CPI and inflation.A hot inflation print, boosted by energy prices, would be very bad for policymakers and the market. It may also cause a feedback loop, where higher inflation will also increase demand for energy stocks which have acted as a haven during periods of inflation. Either way energy stocks look like a good place to be.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewValero EnergyWhenever I find a thematic trend that looks appealing, I go to the Zacks Rank to look for highly rated stock with earnings being revised higher. Valero Energy VLO fits the bill.Valero Energy is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company was founded in 1980. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the U.S., Canada, and the U.K..Valero Energy currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings have been upgraded significantly across timeframes. Over just the last 60 days, current quarter earnings have climbed 45%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVLO is trading at a very reasonable valuation. At just 6x one-year forward earnings, VLO is well below its 5-year median of 12x. Valero Energy also offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, which has increased by an average of 5% annually over the last five years.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVLO stock is off to a good start this year, already up 10%. Over the last ten years Valero stock is up 390%, 3x more than the industry average, and outperforming the broad stock index returns.Marathon PetroleumAnother way to identify good stocks is to look for relative leaders within sectors. Marathon Petroleum MPC is the best performing stock in the XLE Energy ETF. Up 12% over just the last month it has more than doubled the second-best stock in the fund.Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner, transporter, and marketer of petroleum products.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings expectations have been revised higher across timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMPC is trading at a very reasonable valuation of 7.5x one-year forward earnings, which is well below its 10-year median of 11.5x, and just above the industry average of 5.75. Marathon offers a 2.3% dividend yield, which has increased by an average of 7% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVista Oil and GasVista Oil and Gas VIST focuses on the identification, acquisition and development of oil and gas fields primarily in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.Vista Oil and Gas is one of the best performing stocks in the market, dramatically outperforming both the industry and broad market. VIST has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating an upward earnings revision trend.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrent quarter sales are expected to come in at $312 million, a 50% YoY increase. Current year sales are also expected to grow 19% to $1.4 billion. Earnings are projected to see a big boost as well, with estimates of $0.95 per share indicating a 500% increase. Current year earnings estimates are expected to climb to $4.34 per share, a 48% increase.Like the rest of the industry, VIST trades at a very fair valuation. At 4.5x one-year forward earnings it is well below the industry average of 8x, and right in line with its two-year median of 4.5x. VIST offers no dividend payouts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionIt looks like we are entering a new regime in the oil market very soon. If this breakout in oil prices has legs, it can have tremendous influence on how investors behave. I recommend keeping a close eye on oil so long as WTI trades above $80.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is Par Pacific (PARR). PARR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 4.76, which compares to its industry's average of 5.96. Over the past year, PARR's Forward P/E has been as high as 44.68 and as low as 3.01, with a median of 8.95.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PARR has a P/S ratio of 0.25. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.31.Finally, we should also recognize that PARR has a P/CF ratio of 3.80. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PARR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.54. PARR's P/CF has been as high as 62.50 and as low as -19.79, with a median of 3.56, all within the past year.Story continuesIf you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Valero Energy (VLO). VLO is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of Valero Energy currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.17, and its PEG ratio is 1.03. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 5.96 and 0.59.VLO's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.62 and as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.42. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.10, as low as 0.73, with a median of 1.07.Furthermore, Valero Energy holds a P/B ratio of 2.11 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 1.95. VLO's P/B has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.66, with a median of 2.03 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Par Pacific and Valero Energy are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PARR and VLO sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

742,ccdaeecf-ca2a-346a-8068-ce1f11269e28,VLO,2023-03-09,Wall Street Analysts Think Valero Energy (VLO) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-valero-143002825.html,1678113002,STORY,['VLO'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Valero Energy (VLO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Valero Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.23 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.6% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VLOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VLOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Valero Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Valero Energy, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is VLO Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Valero Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.9% over the past month to $23.77.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Valero Energy.

It may not have been easy to hold on to VLO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Valero Energy's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Valero Energy's main business drivers.San Antonio, TX-based Valero Energy Corporation is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company was founded in 1980. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.Moreover, Valero is a leading ethanol producer with 14 ethanol plants in the Midwest that have a combined capacity of 1.73 billion gallons per year. The products of the company are sold in the markets of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Latin America. The company’s brand names are carried by around 7,000 outlets.The company organizes its business through three reportable segments, namely, Refining, Ethanol and Renewable Diesel.Refining: The Refining segment was responsible for 92% of the total margin in 2022. It includes refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation operations. This segment is segregated geographically into the Gulf Coast, mid-continent, West Coast and Northeast regions.Ethanol: The Ethanol segment includes sales of internally produced ethanol and distillers grains. Operations of this segment are geographically located in the Central Plains region of the United States. This segment was responsible for 3.6% of the total margin in 2022.Renewable Diesel: In the first quarter of 2019, the company created this segment. The Renewable Diesel segment incorporates the operations of a consolidated joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel. Notably, the renewable diesel plant is North America’s largest biomass-based diesel plant and it is located in Norco, LA. The segment provided 4.5% of the total margin in 2022, which was supported by the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Valero Energy, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2013 would be worth $3,027.45, or a 202.75% gain, as of March 6, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 166.48% and the price of gold increased 12.57% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for VLO too.Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Importantly, Valero is best placed to reap profits from solid refining margins, mainly owing to the strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located at the Gulf coast area from where there is easy access to the export facilities. The Gulf coast presence helped it to expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results due to increased refinery throughput volumes. Valero intends to quadruple renewable diesel production capacity by 2023.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 7.17%, and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Elevance Health, Inc. ELV, Humana Inc. HUM and Centene Corp. CNC.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Will Biden's Tax Hike for Higher Earners Extend Medicare's Viability?A significant element of the White House’s 2024 budget proposal is expected to be the extension of the life of the Medicare program for another 25 years. U.S. President Joe Biden’s budget is expected to propose a tax hike on high-income Americans to make the Medicare trust fund solvent beyond 2050. The President published an op-ed in the New York Times, highlighting the plans.The proposal will likely include an increased tax of 5% from 3.8% on earned and unearned income of more than $400,000 per annum. It is also expected to enhance Medicare’s ability to negotiate prices for drugs. Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act authorized Medicare to negotiate prices, while the new plan is likely to boost that power.More high-cost drugs are expected to be considered by the insurance program and negotiations can start sooner after they hit the market. This is predicted to save $200 billion over the next 10 years, enhancing the program’s reserves. Per the latest Medicare Trustees Report, the trust fund is expected to reach insolvency in 2028, without any boost.It is to be seen how the Congress reacts to the President's budget as Republicans are expected to ask for federal spending reduction. A discussion on raising the U.S. debt ceiling is also expected to take place.Companies Likely to Witness Membership GrowthWith an aging population, demand for Medicare is expected to rise in the coming days. Managed care players who can gain from membership growth and volumes include UnitedHealth Group Inc., Elevance Health, Inc., Humana Inc., Centene Corp. and others.Story continuesUnitedHealth’s government business, which consists of Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, is expected to witness significant jumps going forward.

Last year, it acquired Integra Managed Care to expand its Medicaid business. With high inflation, demand for its affordable products is expected to rise. Adding members to the government business can provide the company with a steady revenue source.Humana has a significant presence in the Medicare space. It does not expect any tightened government grip in the space to harm the company. In fact, the company expects to grow better than the market despite such tightening moves, highlighting HUM’s confidence in its government business. The company’s acquisition of iCare in Wisconsin expanded its Medicare business a few years back.Centene’s membership has been rising over the past several years due to the increase in Medicaid and Medicare businesses, contract wins and expansion across different regions. CNC’s total membership came in at 27.1 million as of Dec 31, 2022, which increased 4.8% year over year.

746,ccfac86b-5ae0-3b5b-91b6-0aea0ddecc9a,UNH,2023-03-09,10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-invest-financial-131908918.html,1678281548,STORY,['UNH'],"[In this article, we discuss the 10 best stocks to invest in for financial stability. If you want to read about some more stocks in this selection, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.While we all might love the idea of investing in risk-free stocks, there's no such thing as a stock that's 100% safe. Even the best companies can face unexpected trouble, and it's common for even the most stable corporations to get shaken up due to significant price volatility. This was evident during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when many strong companies experienced dramatic drops in stock prices. More recently, we saw this phenomenon in 2022 when rising interest rates, inflation, and international conflict shook the stock market.Although 2023 started off on a decent note, the same can't be claimed for the rest of the year if Barclays Capital Inc.'s predictions are anything to go by. The investment advisory firm says that 2023 will go down as one of the worst for the world economy in four decades. Additionally, Ned Davis Research Inc. puts the odds of a severe global downturn at 65%. However, most investment firms agree that the year will be incredibly uneven, with Deutsche Bank AG seeing the S&amp;P 500 Index rising to about 4,500 in the first half, before falling 25% in the third quarter as a downturn bites — only to jump back up to 4,500 by end-2023 as certain investors tailgate a recovery.Long-term investors ignore the agitating, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Rather than getting caught up in the whirlwinds of uncertainty, they buy the shares of stable companies with reliable performance that’s measured in years, or even decades. Although still subject to volatility like every other stock, these recession-proof equities (see 10 Best Recession Proof Stocks To Invest In) include household names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).Story continues10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial StabilityPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey's database of more than 940 hedge funds and picked the top 10 stocks that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability10. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The company’s systemwide sales rose 5% on a year-over-year basis, while its global comparable sales rose 10.9% year-over-year in 2022. Although the fast-food chain stated that the currency rate has been fluctuating quite a bit, it sees its FY23 capital expenditures to be around $2.2-$2.4 billion. Additionally, at the end of January, the company revealed plans to open 1900 new restaurants this year globally on a gross basis.On February 17, Loop Capital analyst Alton Stump maintained a Buy rating and $328 price target on McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in addition to raising his Q1 growth estimates in the U.S. to 7.5% from 5.5% and FY23 estimates to 4.9% from 4.4%. The analyst cited his latest McDonald's U.S. franchisee checks indicating that same-store sales growth is once again off to a strong start to date in Q1.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 53 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 2 million shares worth $529.3 million.Much like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered a relatively safe bet.9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage corporation founded in 1892, best known as the producer of Coca-Cola. The company offers more than 200 brands—from sodas to waters, from coffees to teas, from juices to kombuchas, and a growing list of flavored alcohol beverages — in more than 200 countries and territories .The beverage giant announced its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023, making it a reliable dividend king to invest in.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian raised the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 from $68 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares February 15. According to the analyst, the company’s “robust” 11% organic sales growth in Q4 in terms of unit cases represents its strong pricing power, limited demand elasticity, and solid execution. Mohsenian points to the company’s 7-8% organic sales growth guidance for FY23 as evidence of strong topline growth.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 59 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, with 400 million shares.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage. Through its subsidiaries, the company generates clean, emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power units in Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.Earlier this January, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised the price target on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to $110 from $105 on higher assumed NEER capital investment opportunities, influenced by his Generation Outlook 2050 analysis. While he believes that renewables are the key driver of NEER's growth, he adds that other decarbonization-related verticals are emerging. Kalton maintained an Overweight rating on the shares of the company.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) was popular among elite funds in Q4 2022, as 61 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.15 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States. On January 5, the retail giant announced the success of its drone delivery program in 2022. The company completed more than 6,000 deliveries via drone during the year from its 36 drone delivery hubs across seven states.On February 15, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $180 from $175 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst raised his estimates on prospects of better sales trends and the likelihood of solid store traffic trends, particularly in January.Evercore ISI added Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to the firm's ""Tactical Outperform"" list on February 17, noting that the stock has lagged the S&amp;P and S&amp;P Retail Index by 5% and 17%, respectively, year-to-date. The firm believes that a 2023 guide down is likely already reflected in the stock performance and sees upside to Q4 results driven by stronger sales and share gains in grocery.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), compared to 68 funds in the earlier quarter. The collective stakes held by elite hedge funds in Q4 2022 increased to $4.85 billion from $4 billion in Q3 2022.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates an international chain of membership warehouses, mainly under the ""Costco Wholesale"" name, that carry quality, brand-name merchandise at substantially lower prices than are typically found at conventional wholesale or retail sources.On February 2, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $568 from $538 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Costco's January sales were ""solid"", and its extreme value proposition will enable the company to continue gaining more members and market share, particularly if the economy continues to soften.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $1.12 billion.Similar to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has historically provided investors with protection against market downturns.Here is what Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund has to say about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labor market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever that can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability.  Suggested articles:10 High Growth AI Stocks To Buy11 High Growth IT Stocks to Buy10 Most Promising Blockchain StocksDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Invest In For Financial Stability is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of UnitedHealth Group. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in UnitedHealth Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see UnitedHealth Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in UnitedHealth Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.0% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.5b worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

The company derives significant revenues from emerging markets like Thailand, India, Russia and Brazil, encouraging it to make distributional, digital and marketing investments in these countries. The Estee Lauder Companies is investing in catering to consumer demand in China and Asia.

(NYSE:EL). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Is Estée Lauder Companies Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 60.22x is currently well-above the industry average of 17.1x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. In addition to this, it seems like Estée Lauder Companies’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Estée Lauder Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Estée Lauder Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? EL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe EL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EL for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for EL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Applied Materials, Inc. and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble performed in-line with the broader market over the past year (down -4.7% vs. -4.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index), but have lagged this year (-7.8% vs. +5.5%). Driving this performance variance is trends in market sentiment that appears to have moved away from the relatively safer parts of the market as represented by P&amp;G.The company posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter. Its organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts that hurt margins. Also, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Applied Materials shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer industry over the past six months (+26.3% vs. +24.4%). The company is witnessing strong momentum across Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services remains positive. Solid demand for semiconductors drove the top line growth. Further, rising multi-year subscription bookings contributed well.Notably, the demand for foundry logic is expected to remain strong, courtesy of the rising need for specialty nodes in automotive, power, 5G rollout, IoT, communications and image sensor markets. Also, growing demand for semiconductor and wafer fab equipment is a tailwind.However, the pandemic-led supply-chain constraints and market uncertainties are major headwinds. Sluggishness in the Display segment remains a concern. Per our estimate, the segment is likely to witness a year-over-year fall of 54.7% in fiscal 2023.    (You can read the full research report on Applied Materials here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Automatic Data Processing have outperformed the Zacks Outsourcing industry over the past year (+9.8% vs. +4.8%).

Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts.However, ADP faces significant competition in each of its product lines.

Inflation, however, has been higher than expected as the core personal consumption expenditures price index increased 0.6% in January and 4.7% from the previous year.Story continuesAs a result of the higher inflation, there is potential for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Saturday, ""It’s clear there is more work to do. In order to put this episode of high inflation behind us, further policy tightening, maintained for a longer time, will likely be necessary.""If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much further, the economy could slow or even enter into a recession. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Building, Real estate, HoldingPhoto by floriane vita on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 14 American stocks with competitive advantages that have dividend growth potential in the future.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now14.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble performed in-line with the broader market over the past year (down -4.7% vs. -4.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index), but have lagged this year (-7.8% vs. +5.5%). Driving this performance variance is trends in market sentiment that appears to have moved away from the relatively safer parts of the market as represented by P&amp;G. The company posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter. Its organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. Also, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Applied Materials shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer industry over the past six months (+26.3% vs. +24.4%). The company is witnessing strong momentum across Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services remained a positive. Solid demand for semiconductors drove the top line growth. Further, rising multi-year subscription bookings contributed well.Notably, the demand for foundry logic is expected to remain strong, courtesy of the rising need for specialty nodes in automotive, power, 5G rollout, IoT, communications and image sensor markets. Also, growing demand for semiconductor and wafer fab equipment is a tailwind.However, the pandemic-led supply-chain constraints and market uncertainties are major headwinds. Sluggishness in the Display segment remains a concern. Per our estimate, the segment is likely to witness a year-over-year fall of 54.7% in fiscal 2023.    (You can read the full research report on Applied Materials here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Automatic Data Processing have outperformed the Zacks Outsourcing industry over the past year (+9.8% vs. +4.8%).

Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts.However, ADP faces significant competition in each of its product lines.

Walmart's margins have followed a similar pattern as it tries to keep prices low for consumers, and maintain traffic for its stores.Kroger Co's margins also rose sharply in the pandemic, as food prices have spiked.P&amp;G, Kroger and Walmart did not immediately return requests for comment.P&amp;G executives said at an industry conference last month that as inflation continues, it becomes harder to increase prices.Executives at Walmart said last month inflation in food and consumables has persisted, with food inflation higher than what they thought it would be.U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative David Cicilline have taken companies to task over price hikes on items shoppers buy every day.The situation is not unique to the United States, with data shared at a recent European Central Bank retreat showing companies there are profiting from high inflation.""Corporate profits and higher margins have been a key driver of inflation and as they start to ease we will see lower prices in real life,"" said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist at progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative. ""What works going up, works coming down. If we see margins ease, companies bring prices down, we'll see lower inflation.""Story continuesSome manufacturers of household goods are easing price hikes. Ketchup maker Kraft Heinz Co, Clorox Co and PepsiCo Inc have indicated they are pressing pause on further raising prices.Clorox declined to comment, while Kraft Heinz and Pepsico did not immediately return a request for comment.P&amp;G and Stouffer's frozen meal maker Nestle SA have said they are planning to continue increasing prices, even as shoppers are buying less and trimming their budgets. Nestle did not immediately return a request for comment.Former Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said in the fall that retail margins - a measure of the price chains charge for a product compared to what they paid for it - have risen ""significantly more"" than wages for the typical store associate.Lowering those margins could help reduce inflation pressures in consumer goods, she said.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)]"

When times are difficult, however, many companies might cut or suspend their dividends.The best dividend stocks often have also increased their annual dividends through multiple market cycles including tough economic recessions.Many dividend stocks have faced fairly substantial headwinds in 2022 given the high inflation which has led to higher interest rates. With higher interest rates, U.S. Treasury yield have increased considerably. As of March 6, the U.S. 10 year Treasury bond has increased 224 basis points in one year to a yield of 3.98%.Given the U.S. 10 year Treasury bond's yield, Treasury bonds have higher yields than many blue chip dividend stocks even though Treasury bonds have substantially lower risk. As a result, considerable capital has flowed out of dividend stocks and the broader market and into the U.S. Treasuries. The capital outflow has led to some lower valuations for many blue chip dividend stocks as a result.Nevertheless, there is still hope that the Federal Reserve will win its fight against inflation in the next few years. If that happens, interest rates could decrease, and capital could flow back into blue chip dividend stocks, giving them potentially a better valuation.Story continuesFor those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks With Strong Balance Sheets.When it comes to dividend stocks, it could be a good idea to own blue chips since companies with fewer competitive advantages might not be able to sustain their dividends as well over the long term. Given the uncertainty in the market, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Software, Technology, ComputerPhoto by Luke Peters on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 13 stocks that paid dividends at least once a year that are regarded by many investors as blue chips.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.13 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest. Short interest refers to the total number of shares of a particular stock that investors have borrowed and sold short, betting that the stock's price will decline. Low short interest means that there are relatively few shares of a stock that have been sold short. This could be a sign that investors are generally optimistic about the stock's prospects and are not expecting its price to drop significantly in the near term. Short selling can be a viable strategy for experienced investors who are willing to take on a higher level of risk. It is useful for investors who believe that a particular stock is overvalued and are willing to bet on its price going down.In 2022, short sellers won big as shorted stocks returned 30.8%, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500, according to a report by financial data marketplace, S3 Partners. The report also mentioned that short sellers in the US recorded $300 billion in market-to-market profits on the average short interest of $973 billion. Another data by Goldman Sachs showed that the 50 most shorted stocks in the Russell 3000 returned 15% this year through January 26, compared with a 6% return of the broader market.Insider Monkey's premium newsletters also use short selling to generate positive returns as well as to weed out risky long candidates. In this article we are also going to utilize short interest to weed out risky high dividend stocks. Usually stocks with very high dividend yields have high dividend yields because their stock prices declined by large amounts and there are valid reasons for those declines. These stocks usually have very high open short interest. Some of these high dividend stocks may continue their declines and be forced to cut their dividends to ""save"" their companies. Intel Corporation (INTC) is a good example. Intel was offering $0.365 in quarterly dividend and its dividend yield increased to nearly 6% as its stock price declined from $52 to $25 over the past year. Two weeks ago, Intel announced that it cut its dividend from $0.365 to $0.125. Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of hedge funds shorting Intel and, even though its open short interest is 2.5 times above Honeywell's - a company with similar market cap -, our quantitative screen of excluding high short interest stocks approach wouldn't have been successful in this case because Intel's short interest is 1.83% (see 10 biggest dividend cuts in 2022)Story continuesThe fluctuating market conditions have turned investors’ attention toward dividend companies as these stocks can generate stable and regular income for shareholders. Moreover, dividend stocks have contributed significantly to the market’s overall return. According to a report by Fidelity, dividends have represented 40% of the stock market’s returns since 1930 and 54% during decades when inflation was at its peak. Some of the most popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Another laggard in Q4 was investment manager Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX). Shares came under pressure along with those of other alternative asset managers due to price declines across asset markets. Blackstone has been met with redemptions in its private real estate fund BREIT (Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust), one of the company’s strong growth drivers in the attractive high net worth channel. Redemptions have picked up due to concerns about the real estate market due to higher interest rates, and because BREIT has been a strong performing product, investors are selling their winners to gain liquidity in an environment where their other assets may have lost value. In early January 2023, it was announced that the University of California is putting $4 billion into BREIT with the same fees as other shareholders but with a commitment to hold shares for 6 years. This announcement may help to allay concerns about BREIT’s stability in the face of redemptions. We still view the business as a proven long-term compounder of value, driven by a virtuous cycle of strong investment results leading to fundraising success. Blackstone remains a smaller position in the portfolio.”6.

The collective value of these stakes is over $823.5 million.GoodHaven Capital Management mentioned Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest. Suggested articles:15 Countries with Highest Inflation Rates20 Most Important Companies in the World10 Hot Growth Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&amp;P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time.Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&amp;P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7.In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc.

Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

We've got KB Home, Dick's Sporting Goods, and also Disney. Well, my play today, it's actually two stocks. So we do have KB Home, but also DR Horton. JP Morgan downgrading both names on softness in housing. Now, higher mortgage challenges with the 30-year fixed rate hitting its highest level that we've seen since November. And that jump in rates have moved potential homebuyers to the sidelines, with mortgage applications declining three weeks in a row to a 28-year low.So as a result, JPMorgan making the case that fundamentals in the housing market may go sideways or potentially soften over the next quarter. Analyst Rehaut there cutting the bank's rating on DHI to neutral, double downgrading KBH to underweight. The homebuilders have actually performed OK since it started the year, really outperforming the broader market in many cases there. But the higher mortgage rate, the fact that the 30-year rate seems to be trending to the upside obviously here a headwind, a risk here for the housing market.- And we've seen the same thing with home prices. And it really just aligns with all of the housing data I feel like we've been seeing, at least generally speaking. With Case-Shiller data last week, six months in a row now we've seen month over month that price decline. And they noted last week too in that release that home prices may continue to weaken moving forward. So really something that we're not just watching right now, but it seems like that trend, Dave, is kind of continuing. So then what does this mean for the homebuilders not necessarily now, but, say, over the next six months? And maybe that's not the best picture.- It's a really tenuous time. And this is ahead of Jerome Powell's-- we talk about everything in the context of Powell speaking to Congress this week. Will he further dampen the news in the housing sector? And it feels like, yes, because I think mortgage rates are at 6.65 last week. Some actually have them north of 7. Mortgage News Daily has them already north of 7% on the 30 year.Story continuesAnd I think either way they are headed back north of 7% in the next month, maybe the next six weeks, which is a gain of more than a full percentage point in just over a month's time. This housing market is really going to contract further in the months ahead. I can't imagine any good news in this environment, especially given the hawkish tone we're expecting from Jerome Powell tomorrow. It just feels like a tough time ahead.- It almost makes you wonder in some ways too-- I know there was a story on the banking sector and talking about rates. When you think about rising mortgage rates, do you consider buying now if rates are going to go back up even higher? I know you're not getting--- I think it's just [INTERPOSING VOICES]- I know you're not getting a deal. But as you're talking about it going up above 7, if you're really that interested in buying, maybe you're just never going to get that deal.- Yeah.- [INAUDIBLE]- Yeah. But the hope is that home prices are going to tick back just a little bit to make it a little bit more of an attractive deal for you. But, I mean, still, [INTERPOSING VOICES] year over year [INTERPOSING VOICES]- The buyers I'm hearing right now are cash buyers. When I talk to realtors across the country, that's the action they're seeing, people that have nothing to do with these mortgage rates. And I think that's what we're going to see for the next couple of months.- And that's why first-time homebuyers are being priced out for the most part.]"

Let's talk about the economy with Semafor's Liz Hoffman. She's the author of the new book ""Crash Landing, the Inside Story of How the World's Biggest Companies Survived an Economy on the Brink."" Liz, nice to see you. We'll get to the book in just a moment. First, what do you see happening with this economy? Any chance the Fed chair can cool off that labor market, just about two jobs per available worker.LIZ HOFFMAN: Yeah. The Fed has had a real hard time with the labor market. You've seen the openings cool a little bit, but still about double what they were before the pandemic, and just absolutely no sign that the wage war, the talent war is cooling in anywhere outside of Silicon Valley, where there is, frankly, a lot of slack. It's just been incredibly hard. And the one place I think the Fed's had a little more success with its playbook is in the housing market. But, again, that's the most rate-sensitive corner of the economy. And things that are a little bit trickier I think-- I, mean they're really pushing on a string with a lot of the labor stuff.- Liz, when it comes to a more aggressive Fed raising the odds of a recession, how do you see that and how potentially bad or deep this recession could get if the Fed doesn't let up any time soon?LIZ HOFFMAN: I mean, I think it's just worth pointing out that they're willing to put the economy into a recession. I feel like we don't say that out loud enough. And the market seems constantly surprised by that. That may well be the cost of this. Most people I talk to think it will be to the extent we're in one now pretty short and fairly mild and we should be snapped back by later this year.Story continues- OK. So let's talk about the book ""Crash Landing"" in which there was no playbook, as you point out, for CEOs to handle the devastating circumstances. And you talk about how some of them did manage their way out of it. Let's start with Airbnb's Brian Chesky. What did he do in the midst of all the chaos?LIZ HOFFMAN: Airbnb is such a fascinating story. They had come into 2020 expecting to go public, the biggest event in a private companies trajectory. They were going to join the pantheon of Silicon Valley unicorns. And Brian Chesky had spent the holiday season coming into 2020 with a pile of prospectuses, kind of figuring out what story he wanted to tell. And the one he'd landed on was that this would be the year of connection, which just always struck me and stuck with me as I reported the book.And then bookings just fell off a cliff. I mean, the idea that you would, frankly, leave your home for a while and go to a stranger's home seemed insane to a lot of people. He did two things. He raised money in a pretty humbling way. Raised $2 billion from private investment firms in April of 2020. Required a major cut in their valuation, which is something most tech CEOs are pretty reluctant to do. And then pretty quickly pivoted. I would say got a little lucky, but recognized that, in fact, people did want to travel, but they didn't want to go to a hotel in Las Vegas. They wanted to go to a cabin in the woods for a month.And so they pivoted to long-term stays very quickly and, really, were back on the IPO track by that summer, went public at the end of 2020 at a just monster valuation. And so, to me, it's a lesson in acting quickly, jumping on the trend when it looks favorable, and really kind of seeing that process through.- So, Liz, sticking with the travel sector, but more specifically looking at the airlines, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker very committed, making multiple trips to Capitol Hill to secure that multibillion dollar bailout. What did we learn from him and what that tells us about the airline industry today?LIZ HOFFMAN: I mean, Doug Parker lived in the Willard hotel for a lot of 2020. I should start by saying that American in particular came into this crisis in a fairly weak position. So the government aid was for them in particular absolutely crucial. But stepping back, airlines, you know, I think coming into 2020 there was this sense that they had kind of escaped the boom and bust cycle that is so core, unfortunately, to that industry. They are in the business of flying gigantic capital-intensive hunks of metal around and are constantly lurching from one crisis to another.And, look, I think there's a fair amount of criticism that you can levy on the airline bailout, which is fundamentally what it was. But just think about how much the sort of travel hell of 2021-2022, the holiday meltdowns that we saw at Southwest. I would just caution people to think about how much worse that would have been had this industry, which is heavily unionized, heavily regulated and training and hours and compliance, you know, had gotten thrown off the rails. The cost of doing that, of course, was that it just goes down as another instance of moral hazard and gives everyone another excuse to to, frankly, hate on the airlines, which is a perennial villain.- The US auto industry was bailed out long before. And two CEOs had to navigate COVID, Jim Farley, who's the CEO now, and formerly Jim Hackett. What were the circumstances facing them? And how'd they handle it?LIZ HOFFMAN: Ford came in to the crisis incredibly indebted and sort of, strategically, had lost a lot of ground to companies like Tesla, a lot of the EV startups, a lot of Chinese carmakers. So they had both a financial problem and a strategic problem. The financial problem largely solved itself when the Fed effectively agreed to backstop a huge portion of the corporate debt market. In particular, Jim Hackett had been putting out feelers in Washington.If you'll remember, an early Fed program had agreed to put Fed money behind very high-rated corporate bonds. Ford had lost its investment grade credit rating fairly early in the crisis. And Jim Hackett did some very quiet lobbying and got a tweak to that rule that allowed the Fed to, effectively, backstop Ford debt. And they did the largest junk bond offering in history. The other part of the Ford story that I found compelling-- Ford is a company that sort of oozes Americana. They made bombers in World War II. They made iron lung for polio patients in the 20th century.There's a lot of criticism, fairly, I think, about companies sort of pursuing the last penny at the cost of sort of bigger ideals. But Ford has actually always remained fairly true to that DNA. And they stepped up and said, look, there's something we can do here. And they ended up making ventilators, face shields. They used batteries from their power tools and basically pieces of F-150 air conditioning systems, and they made these respirators to help purify the breathing mechanisms for first responders and really help keep hospitals staffed. So I think they deserve a lot of credit for that.- All right. Nonfiction books about leaders persevering, my favorite personal category. It ain't even close. The book is ""Crash Landing.""

I look forward to reading.]"

The lawsuit has been filed on concerns that the merger, on taking effect, will be anti-competitive.The lawsuit alleges that the $3.8-billion deal, on materialization, will lead to higher fares and reduced number of seats, resulting in an unfavorable scenario for passengers travelling on the flights. JetBlue had plans to remove 10-15% of seats from every Spirit plane, per the complaint. Per U.S. senator, Elizabeth Warren, ""Americans want more choices and lower prices for airline tickets, not another giant merger.""The roadblock pertaining to the impending merger comes at a time when the U.S. airlines are struggling from high labor and fuel costs. A merger is looked at as a way aimed at saving costs. Making matters worse as far as the future of the deal is concerned, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is supporting the lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice.We remind investors that both JetBlue and Spirit filed a transfer application with the USDOT asking for permission to combine and operate their international routes under one certificate. SAVE and JBLU had also filed an exemption application requesting the USDOT to permit them to operate under common ownership before the requested transfer. The USDOT is likely to block the transfer of SAVE’s airline certificate.However, JBLU’s management put forward the argument that the takeover of Spirit Airlines would result in a market share of 9% for the former and allow it to better compete with the leading U.S. airlines like American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL. Given this back drop, it will be interesting to wait and see the future course of action regarding the deal.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, both Spirit Airlines and JetBlue carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, Alaska Air Group Inc. ALK and JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Industry Likely to Revive Lost Glory in 2023The global airlines industry is set to revive its lost glory in 2023. The industry suffered a massive hit from early 2020 to mid-2022, due to pandemic-induced travel restrictions and lockdowns. However, as the United States and most countries globally removed air travel restrictions buoyed by the gradual fading out of coronavirus infections, the airline industry is gaining its foothold.The pent-up demand is driving traffic for airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes, there is a wave of optimism surrounding air-travel demand. The buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand is expected to improve further in 2023.IATA's Bullish ForecastIn December 2022, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that the net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023. The top line in 2023 is anticipated at $779 billion compared with the previous estimate of $727 billion.Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 [pre-coronavirus] levels) despite economic uncertainties. Cargo revenues are expected to be around $150 billion, suggesting an increase of nearly $48.6 billion from the pre-pandemic level of 2019.Positive DevelopmentsMajor airlines like American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings results with strong guidance for the near term. Improved air travel demand was the primary reasons for the upbeat guidance.Story continuesAlaska Air Group Inc. too is being aided by buoyant air-travel-demand. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing. ALK expects first-quarter 2023 total revenues to increase 29-32% year over year.JetBlue Airways Corp. has partnered CHOOOSE to create a new online platform, which allows passengers to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights. To stop these harmful emissions, passengers can make financial contributions to fund the usage of environmentally-friendly sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on JetBlue flights.Owing to its environmentally-friendly attitude, AAL has improved its fuel efficiency by more than 10% since 2013, in turn saving 1.9 billion gallons of fuel and preventing 19 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. AAL used 2 million gallons of SAF in 2022, thereby doubling its usage year over year.Moreover, the airline industry suffered last year due to higher crude oil prices that were triggered primarily by the prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine. However, oil prices, the major source of costs for airlines, retreated by nearly 30% from the March-April peak of last year.Finally, China’s recent reopening and removal of all travel-related restrictions after a long COVID-19 lockdowns will benefit the airline industry. The resilient demand will allow several debt-ridden companies to fix their balance sheets.Bottom LineAir-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines' top lines. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is an added positive. The well-being of companies in this industry is linked to the health of the overall economy.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NASDAQ:PFG) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-principal-financial-111853343.html,1678360733,STORY,['PFG'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Principal Financial Group's shares before the 14th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.64 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.56 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Principal Financial Group has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current stock price of $83.23. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Principal Financial Group is paying out just 13% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Principal Financial Group's earnings per share have risen 20% per annum over the last five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Principal Financial Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayHas Principal Financial Group got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Principal Financial Group more closely.In light of that, while Principal Financial Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Principal Financial Group and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The sustainability bond reinforces the company's longstanding commitment to uphold the core values of our business approach that balances purpose and profit. With the publication, the Company has fulfilled its commitment to publish such a report every year until fully allocated.The report details that since the issuance, $397 million, which represents 100% of the net proceeds, has been allocated to four Eligible Categories under Aflac Incorporated's Sustainability Bond Framework: Communities, Green Buildings, Renewable Energy and Socioeconomic Advancement and Empowerment. These categories also align with and incorporate the priorities set forth in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. The report also describes, where feasible, the estimated environmental and social impacts of the assets, which range from 268,700 megawatts of solar power generation to 18,064 patients receiving access to quality healthcare.While the Framework permits net proceeds to be attributed to investments in or financings of Eligible Sustainability Assets completed up to 36 months before the issuance of a Sustainability Bond, 88% of the investments were new investments. Commenting on the report, Aflac Incorporated President and Chief Operating Officer Frederick J. Crawford said: ""In today's environment, there is a demand from both customers and investors to balance purpose and profit like never before, and that is what we are doing. Call it corporate social responsibility; environmental, social and governance; or just doing the right thing. At Aflac, we believe that helping our stakeholders and the people in our communities have a better quality of life, while being mindful of environmental impacts, is not only the right thing to do, but that it also makes good business sense and gives people a greater desire to be affiliated with of our company.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Sherwin-Williams, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 18%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 11% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sherwin-Williams compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Sherwin-Williams.The Trend Of ROCESherwin-Williams' ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 67% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Sherwin-Williams' ROCETo bring it all together, Sherwin-Williams has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a solid 68% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Sherwin-Williams can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Sherwin-Williams does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Workers are needed with skills to build and run mines producing lithium, nickel, copper and other metals to feed the green energy transition.Freeport-McMoRan Inc's U.S. copper production slipped at the end of 2022 and the company expects it to dip 1%this year due to a lack of talent at a time of rising copper demand.The Phoenix-based company, which has more than 1,000 U.S. job openings, has boosted already-lucrative salaries and offered one-time bonuses to lure and retain workers, but has begun using contractors to run at least one U.S. mine, Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told Reuters on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.""It is affecting our operations to a degree and affecting our expansion plans. We're just trying to make our work as attractive to people as we can,"" said Adkerson, who has run the company since 2003. ""But it's not an insurmountable problem.""Freeport has boosted its outreach to college-age students and waived baccalaureate requirements for some mine supervisory positions, he said. Freeport has also expanded its outreach to women, highlighting that several of the company's largest North American mines are led by women and that Kathleen Quirk, Freeport's president, runs the company alongside Adkerson.Freeport, which operates mines in many rural locations, has also in recent years built more gymnasiums, grocery stores, retail outlets and related facilities at mine sites for workers and their families.Freeport peer Rio Tinto Ltd has more than 4,000 employees in Utah, where the company runs the Kennecott copper mine. But Rio also aims to open the Resolution Copper mine, a massive underground operation that will require thousands of new employees, posing a recruitment challenge for the Anglo-Australian company.""We do need to step up on partnerships with universities in Utah and Arizona and the traditional schools like Colorado (School of Mines), to make sure that (talent is there) in the future,"" said Baatar.

801,7acadb8f-a94a-331d-a430-2113e15546a6,PEP,2023-03-09,12 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-dividend-giants-lowest-short-130606679.html,1678280766,STORY,"['DOC', 'BX', 'DVN', 'EPR', 'INTC', 'GLP-PB', 'CIM-PB', 'PG', 'GOGL', 'PEP']","[In this article, we discuss 12 dividend giants with the lowest short interest. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest. Short interest refers to the total number of shares of a particular stock that investors have borrowed and sold short, betting that the stock's price will decline. Low short interest means that there are relatively few shares of a stock that have been sold short. This could be a sign that investors are generally optimistic about the stock's prospects and are not expecting its price to drop significantly in the near term. Short selling can be a viable strategy for experienced investors who are willing to take on a higher level of risk. It is useful for investors who believe that a particular stock is overvalued and are willing to bet on its price going down.In 2022, short sellers won big as shorted stocks returned 30.8%, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500, according to a report by financial data marketplace, S3 Partners. The report also mentioned that short sellers in the US recorded $300 billion in market-to-market profits on the average short interest of $973 billion. Another data by Goldman Sachs showed that the 50 most shorted stocks in the Russell 3000 returned 15% this year through January 26, compared with a 6% return of the broader market.Insider Monkey's premium newsletters also use short selling to generate positive returns as well as to weed out risky long candidates. In this article we are also going to utilize short interest to weed out risky high dividend stocks. Usually stocks with very high dividend yields have high dividend yields because their stock prices declined by large amounts and there are valid reasons for those declines. These stocks usually have very high open short interest. Some of these high dividend stocks may continue their declines and be forced to cut their dividends to ""save"" their companies. Intel Corporation (INTC) is a good example. Intel was offering $0.365 in quarterly dividend and its dividend yield increased to nearly 6% as its stock price declined from $52 to $25 over the past year. Two weeks ago, Intel announced that it cut its dividend from $0.365 to $0.125. Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of hedge funds shorting Intel and, even though its open short interest is 2.5 times above Honeywell's - a company with similar market cap -, our quantitative screen of excluding high short interest stocks approach wouldn't have been successful in this case because Intel's short interest is 1.83% (see 10 biggest dividend cuts in 2022)Story continuesThe fluctuating market conditions have turned investors’ attention toward dividend companies as these stocks can generate stable and regular income for shareholders. Moreover, dividend stocks have contributed significantly to the market’s overall return. According to a report by Fidelity, dividends have represented 40% of the stock market’s returns since 1930 and 54% during decades when inflation was at its peak. Some of the most popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).In view of the above discussion, we will discuss dividend giants with the lowest short interest in this article.12 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short InterestPhoto by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify dividend stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion and dividend yields above 5%, as of March 7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Another laggard in Q4 was investment manager Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX). Shares came under pressure along with those of other alternative asset managers due to price declines across asset markets. Blackstone has been met with redemptions in its private real estate fund BREIT (Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust), one of the company’s strong growth drivers in the attractive high net worth channel. Redemptions have picked up due to concerns about the real estate market due to higher interest rates, and because BREIT has been a strong performing product, investors are selling their winners to gain liquidity in an environment where their other assets may have lost value. In early January 2023, it was announced that the University of California is putting $4 billion into BREIT with the same fees as other shareholders but with a commitment to hold shares for 6 years. This announcement may help to allay concerns about BREIT’s stability in the face of redemptions. We still view the business as a proven long-term compounder of value, driven by a virtuous cycle of strong investment results leading to fundraising success. Blackstone remains a smaller position in the portfolio.”6.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Giants with Lowest Short Interest. Suggested articles:15 Countries with Highest Inflation Rates20 Most Important Companies in the World10 Hot Growth Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&amp;P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time.Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&amp;P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years.

Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. PPG Industries, Inc.

Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.  Suggested articles:15 Best Small Cap Stocks Ready to Explode11 Most Profitable Pot Stocks Now11 High Growth Monthly Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care, H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22, 2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation, which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling, called angioedema, may occur most commonly on the face, hands and feet, but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines, medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However, the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients, who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms, including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B) evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission, while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Story continuesAbout the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program, known as LIBERTY-CUPID, includes Studies A and B, two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU.Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU, Regeneron and Sanofi are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune Technology Regeneron’s VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron’s President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent, REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, atopic hand and foot dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, CSU, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

Analysts had said the other drug, MK-0616, would need to show a more than 50% reduction in LDL level, similar to drugs from rivals Regeneron and Sanofi SA and Amgen .The data were presented at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting in New Orleans.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts. Dividend zombies are companies with century-long dividend payouts, whereas dividend kings are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 50 years or more. 2022 was a difficult year from an investing point of view due to high inflation and continuous changes in monetary policies. Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well.Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors.

(NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records.15 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments.15. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103 Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7.In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc.

Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”14.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.

It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. PPG Industries, Inc.

Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years.Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade.We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6.

Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.  Suggested articles:15 Best Small Cap Stocks Ready to Explode11 Most Profitable Pot Stocks Now11 High Growth Monthly Dividend Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

The announcements are included in Union Pacific's second annual We Are One report, published today, which highlights Union Pacific's strategy for creating a diverse workforce while remaining steadfast in its vision of building America.

Knowing that inclusive leadership starts at the top, Union Pacific's board of directors became majority diverse at 60% for the first time in 2022.

811,cef4a3d8-452b-3155-b4e3-536c037dddbc,UNP,2023-03-09,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-met-slowing-returns-capital-110234939.html,1678186954,STORY,['UNP'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Union Pacific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$9.8b ÷ (US$65b - US$5.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceIn the above chart we have measured Union Pacific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?There hasn't been much to report for Union Pacific's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Union Pacific in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Union Pacific is paying out 45% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Union Pacific's ROCEIn summary, Union Pacific isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 70% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Union Pacific that you might find interesting.While Union Pacific may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 1.3% over the past six months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 0.6% appreciation and 5.1% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry,some railroad companies like United Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

GPS is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Mar 9. The company is likely to register declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 59 cents per share compared with a loss of 2 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus loss estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter has narrowed by a couple of cents in the past 30 days. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $4.3 billion, indicating a 4.4% decline from that reported in the year-ago quarter.For fiscal 2022, the consensus mark for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 22 cents, suggesting a decline from earnings of $1.44 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark has narrowed by a couple of cents in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2022 revenues is pegged at $15.7 billion, suggesting a 5.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter total revenues to decline 5.1% year over year to $4,293.6 million. We also expect the company to report a loss of 75 cents per share, whereas it reported a loss of 2 cents in the prior-year quarter. For fiscal 2022, we estimate revenues to decline 6% to $15,666.6 million, with a loss per share of 40 cents, whereas it reported earnings of $1.44 in the prior year.In the last reported quarter, Gap’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3,650%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 933.9%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteGap’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is expected to have gained from sturdy demand and strength in the Athleta brand. The company has been witnessing strong demand for formal clothing and dresses, as people have been preferring more formal clothing, dresses, woven tops and pants, and shelving casual wear as they return to travel, work and social occasions after two years of the pandemic.Continued momentum across its Athleta brand has been acting as a key growth driver for long. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales. Increased focus on performance active, as well as active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well.The company has been aggressively undertaking cost-management actions, which is expected to have improved its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Some notable efforts were the elimination of 500 existing and open positions in its corporate offices, a hiring freeze, a pause on contractor spend, the renegotiation of advertising agency contracts, reduced technology and operating costs, and rationalized investments. These endeavors are likely to help offset higher incentive compensation and rising labor costs.However, Gap has been witnessing longer transit times, more delays, pack-and-hold strategies, and elevated levels of slow-turning basics and seasonal products.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected inventory to remain high in the fiscal fourth quarter due to remaining fall products despite higher markdowns in the fiscal third quarter. Huge discounts and elevated commodity prices are likely to have continued weighing on margins in the fiscal fourth quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected sales to decline year over year in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, resulting from the continued uncertain consumer environment and higher promotions. The company also raised concerns about a drab holiday season this year. Also, rising prices of essential commodities are likely to continue to hurt lower-income consumers' spending on non-essentials like apparel.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Gap this season.

Will report its fourth-quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday, March 9.The analyst is looking for 4Q22 EPS of ($0.52) versus ($0.02) last year, and the consensus of ($0.47).On the topline, the analyst is looking for total sales to decline 5.3% YoY to $4.29 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of down 3.7% YoY $4.36 billion.Last quarter, management noted fourth quarter sales could be down mid-single digits, due in part to the timing of licenses and an Old Navy holiday event that occurred in Q3, as well as cautious planning for a challenging and promotional holiday season said the analyst.Gross margin is expected to benefit by approximately 540 basis points YoY, as the company laps about $245 million of incremental air freight costs from the fourth quarter of FY21, the analyst remarked.However, air freight leverage is planned to be offset by roughly 200 bps of ongoing inflationary and commodity cost pressures, added the analyst.Management outlined several strategic priorities to strengthen the business model in the near term as the company navigates the current macro environment, added the analyst.GPS continued to reduce its operating expense base, resulting in approximately $250 million in estimated annualized savings by eliminating 500 existing and open roles across corporate and pausing hiring and contractor spend for the rest of 2022, renegotiating advertising agency contracts, and reducing spend across technology, operating costs, and rationalized investments said the analyst.However, Q4 was not expected to benefit from these actions as a result of timing and severance, in addition to higher seasonal labor costs compared to a year ago, the analyst added.Following Gap's better-than-expected Q3 and sequential improvements across all brands, the analyst believes Q4 could prove more challenging as many retailers saw consumers gravitating to value and clearance before and after the holidays, the analyst said.Price Action: GPS shares are trading lower by 0.27% at $12.73 on the last check Monday.  Story continues Latest Ratings for GPSDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022BMO CapitalMaintainsMarket PerformMar 2022Credit SuisseMaintainsNeutralMar 2022JP MorganMaintainsNeutralView More Analyst Ratings for GPSView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Purpose has driven Cisco Networking Academy-one of the world's longest-running IT skills-to-jobs education programs-for the last 25 years.Inclusive education is the key to economic development, and in recognition of UNESCO's International Day of Education 2023, it is fitting to reflect on how the Networking Academy program has aligned, and will continue to align, with this year's theme: ""to invest in people, prioritize education.""""Without inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong opportunities for all, countries will not succeed in achieving gender equality and breaking the cycle of poverty that is leaving millions of children, youth and adults behind,"" says UNESCO.Opportunities must be available ""for all,"" and this continues to motivate our programs, platforms, and curriculum at Cisco Networking Academy.The right to digital literacyWith 40 courses in 27 languages, Networking Academy reached 3.2 million learners in 190 countries in 2022 alone. But, we're not done yet!As a technology leader, we recognize people everywhere must have access to connectivity and learning resources-no matter their background. According to one UNESCO report, ""to state the obvious, digital literacy and access are a basic right in the twenty-first century; without them it is increasingly difficult to participate civically and economically.""Skills for All with Cisco Networking Academy is one of our recent innovations to address this issue. Skills for All is a free, ‘mobile-first' learning platform, that scales access to education for anyone with access to a smartphone.Education everywhereBut while 5.3 billion people worldwide were connected to the Internet in 2022, 2.7 billion remain unconnected. Since 2015, Cisco has collaborated with government leaders, industry, and academia to support the delivery of national digital agendas through the Cisco Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program.Story continuesIn South Africa…CDA leads initiatives to help address the widening digital skills gap. For example, Cisco collaborated with the National Library of South Africa to launch a series of digital learning hubs across the country, as Cisco aims to empower Africa with 3 million more tech workers. The learning hubs are equipped with computers and internet connectivity and allow access to Networking Academy courses.In India…Networking Academy partners do an astonishing job of widening the reach of the program as well. The NIIT Foundation in India, for example, developed ATM-like ""Hole-in-the-Wall Learning Stations,"" making computers and the Internet available for children who would otherwise not have access. NIIT Foundation continues to support tens of thousands of students, many from underserved communities, such as people with disabilities, India's LGBTQIA+ community, and prison staff and inmates.In Germany…For many, the ReDi School for Digital Integration is a second chance at a better future, offering free access to digital education and accelerating integration into the labor market. Watch the program in action.Merely connecting people to the Internet is not enough. One World Bank study concludes that the ""digital transformation of countries, regions or cities must be driven by leadership and include strategies that address digital skills for all.""In Chile…‘Chilenas Conectadas y Seguras' is an initiative promoted by the Cisco Country Digital Acceleration program and executed by Networking Academy. It seeks to encourage the participation of women in the IT market in Chile through free courses open to the public, workshops, challenges, trainings, and competitions.In the United States…We know we can create a more equitable playing field when we offer access to education to anyone-and, meet learners where they are and on their terms. The Networking Academy is committed to supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our public private partnership with high schools, community colleges, universities, and non-profits has resulted in diverse student participation, including 20% Black/African American, 17% Latino/Hispanic, and 1% American Native/Alaska Native. We are proud of our public private partnership with 49% of the community colleges in the U.S. And, as part of Cisco's support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Networking Academy is growing its skills-to-job training to contribute to student success.Education for everybodyThe barriers to education are not only geographical.People living with disabilities worldwide are often excluded, and Networking Academy is committed to expanding our reach to everyone. We continue to work with our partners to offer meaningful education for people living with disabilities.While women have seen advances in education and career opportunities in the last few decades, in some places they are still being held back. The Networking Academy program offers a pathway to meaningful employment for women where otherwise their options are limited.Looking ahead, our goal is to provide digital and cybersecurity skills training to 25 million learners over the next 10 years around the world through the Networking Academy program. Crucially, that education will be inclusive and equitable-available everywhere, and for everybody.Learn more on our Cisco Networking Academy 25th Anniversary website.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742644/Cisco-Networking-Academy-Offers-Inclusive-and-Equitable-Education-to-Power-Global-Development]"

(CSCO): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cisco-systems-140002892.html,1678284002,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 points to a change of +11.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.02 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.54 billion and $58.64 billion estimates indicate +9.7% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.9%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.18%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CSCO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 75% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-130030233.html,1678280430,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Cisco Systems' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cisco Systems. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Cisco Systems already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cisco Systems' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cisco Systems. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Cisco Systems, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$52m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cisco Systems. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

827,fe988bcd-8c4a-3335-b769-f0946869827d,CSCO,2023-03-09,What Black History Month Means to Members of Cisco’s Connected Black Professionals,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-history-month-means-members-173000356.html,1678123800,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Monday, March 6, 2023, Press release pictureBlack History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by African Americans and a time for recognizing their central role in U.S. history. Also known as African American History Month, the event grew out of ""Negro History Week,"" the brainchild of noted historian Carter G. Woodson and other prominent African Americans. Since 1976, every U.S. president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month. Other countries around the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating Black history.To me, it is a time of reflection, celebration, and honor for those that have gone before us and about the lessons we can learn from them. It sometimes is said that the shortest month of the year was set aside for Black History Month, and thus is yet another insult toward our community and its achievements. For me, Black History is American history, and it is impossible to tell America's history without a truthful exposition of Black people. So, for me, I celebrate Black History every day.What is Connected Black Professionals (CBP)?Cisco's Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are known internally as Inclusive Communities and Connected Black Professionals (CBP) is an organization for Cisco employees that support the Black community inside and outside of Cisco. They help drive a sense of community and belonging for Black Cisconians and their allies and champion initiatives to ensure that the community is able to reap all of the benefits working at a global company like Cisco. The ERO has a global reach and seeks to be a reflection of the Black experience the world over.What does Black History Month mean to other Ciscoians?I'm proud to be a member of the CBP community and spotlight some of the exceptional Black Cisconians who exemplify our commitment to social justice. Here are some of my colleagues and their thoughts on Black History Month:Story continuesShaunya Ishmael, Program Manager, Social Justice Action on HBCUs""I view Black History Month as a time of reflection and celebration. It is a time to reflect on our history, our struggles, and our accomplishments. It is a time to reflect on what we have endured as African Americans and on the triumphs that have arisen from those struggles. It is a time to celebrate our accomplishments and to remember the giants on whose shoulders we stand. It is a time to celebrate our culture, our resiliency, and our ability to thrive though adversity.I also view Black History Month as a call to action. It is a call to action to pass our stories down to our younger generation, so they understand the richness of our history. It is a call to action to push until the telling of our story is not contained to a month but is part of the everyday retelling of American history. It is a call to action to continue to push forward until the day that our history is retold honestly and without editing or embellishment. It is a call to action to reach back into the community and pay forward the blessings we have received so that our community continues to thrive.""Donyea Perry, Virtual Demand Center, Collaboration""What does Black History Month mean to you? Being posed this simple question instantly transported me back to sitting in my living room as a child, an earshot away from ""grown folk conversation"". It was in those conversations that I was first introduced to pioneers such as, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Rebecca M. Johnson, and many other great Black leaders/activist. I remember hearing my mom, uncles and aunts in great debates discussing what I would call, Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness for Black people. They would passionately discuss governmental systems, systemic oppression, educational blockers, job displacement and many other issues that plague the Black community in America. As the discussions continued, inevitably someone would shout, ‘What we need to do is…'This phrase would immediately cause a shift in the room. The discussion would transition from stating problems to asking the question, what can we do about it? With every solution proposed the volume in the room would rise, as if the escalation of their voices could change governments and create opportunities. The tape recorder would be pulled out so every suggestion offered could be played back and used as a reference point as my uncle had his notepad and pen mapping out program ideas and identifying key contacts. As the discussion got deeper, my family would seek a different perspective, often calling in someone from the younger generation. Even as a small child my family taught me every perspective needs to be heard and all who ask for it should listen with the intent to understanding.It was here, where I began developing my idea of what Black History Month means to me. It means the representation of past, present, and future. Black History Month is a moment for remembering and celebrating but also a time for reflecting, strategizing, and mobilizing. For this month is as much about the future as it is about the past.Advancement is an ever-flowing river; empowering those who are strong enough to withstand the current. As a people we have never stood on the shore resting on our laurels. We push boundaries and fight for our future generations. During Black History Month I look to my family, co-workers and to myself to utilize our combined strengths and to take up the responsibility to learn, to educate, and to find solutions concerning equality for our people.""Andrea Parker, Marketing Specialist""What Does Black History Month Mean to Me?At times, Black people are viewed as a spectacle; an amazement that is usually emphasized when profit or credibility is involved or, when mutual interests align with those who may have found us unfavorable, initially. However, Black History Month is a moment in the year where my culture is highlighted for the amazement it truly is. Stolen realities are uncovered and, if it's paying attention, the world gets an opportunity to learn about pure, unadulterated, Black beauty and excellence.As a child, my school system would highlight the same figures every year during Black History Month. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Madame C.J. Walker and the like. With no intentions to diminish these astonishing men and women nor their accomplishments and contributions to the culture, my school system provided limited exposure to the true meaning of Black History Month.Since becoming an adult, I have learned to appreciate Black History Month beyond the cosmetic appearance the world offers. From music appreciation, film and literature, the importance of the Black dollar and financial literacy, Black History Month enriches my soul as I continue to learn more and appreciate those who have made a way for me to be the best version of black that I can possibly be. We are Black every day and feel the effects, daily, whether positive or negative. I only hope that someone out there, who doesn't know what it's like to be me, uses the month of February to further educate themselves in my culture and learn to appreciate our blackness as constantly as I do.""How to become an ally to the Black community In the U.S. the Black population is growing, with 46.8 million people who self-identify as Black. Despite representing about 14% of the U.S. population, prejudice and racism are still an ongoing problem. According to Reuters, ""Inequality between white and Black Americans persists in almost every aspect of society and the economy"" and systemic racism is impacting Black individuals' education, income, health and even lifespans.Allyship leads to real change for friends, family, and colleagues who are part of the Black community. Please consider taking action and speaking up. Here are three ways to begin:Look for literature, podcasts, or documentaries that share the history and lived experiences of Black individuals and communities.Research organizations that support the advancement of equity and inclusion for Black communities and consider donating or volunteering with them.Don't just show your support during Black History Month. Listen to, celebrate, and uplift voices from Black individuals and communities all year.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/742210/What-Black-History-Month-Means-to-Members-of-Ciscos-Connected-Black-Professionals]"
